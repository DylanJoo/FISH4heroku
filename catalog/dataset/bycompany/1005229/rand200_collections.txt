1005229_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	In addition, we sponsor advisory boards made up of representatives of our primary distributors and service-after-sale network members who are invited to participate in discussions focused on improving products and service.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	These boards enable us and our primary distributors to exchange product and market information relevant to industry trends.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2011 was approximately $89,393,000 compared to approximately $67,819,000 at March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	Orders for products that are manufactured to customers specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	The material handling industry remains highly fragmented.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; for tire shredders is Granutech; and for light-rail systems is Gorbel.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	At March 31, 2011, we had 2,531 employees; 1,516 in the U.S./Canada, 64 in Latin America, 658 in Europe and 293 in Asia.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Approximately 13% of our employees are represented under four separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between September 2011 and May 2014.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	The collective bargaining negotiations which will begin in September 2011 will impact approximately 6% of our workforce.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P88_S4	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; and electro-mechanical components.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our Purchasing Council to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our distribution channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S4	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P89_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency exposures.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements and a cross-currency swap to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	In addition, we use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P92_S2	In 2001, we began implementing Lean improvement techniques in our business which has resulted in inventory reductions in required manufacturing floor area, shorter product lead time and increased productivity.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, castings and electro-mechanical components are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P93_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P93_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P94_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, have not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2012.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	In addition, we notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Coffing Hoist facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P95_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $200,000.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	In March of 2007, we also discovered the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Damascus, Virginia hoist plant and have notified the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (the DEQ ).
1005229_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	We filed an application with the DEQ to participate in its voluntary remediation program and have been accepted.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	We are currently investigating under the terms of the DEQ Voluntary Remediation Program and, if appropriate, will remediate site conditions at the facility.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P96_S3	At this time, investigative and remediation costs are not expected to be significant.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	In June of 2007, we were identified by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( the DEC ), along with other companies, as a potential responsible party ( PRP ) at the Frontier Chemical Royal Avenue Site in Niagara Falls, New York.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	From 1974 to 1992, the Frontier Royal Avenue Site had been operated as a commercial waste treatment and disposal facility.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	We sent waste sulfuric acid pickling solution generated at our facility in Tonawanda, New York to the Frontier Royal Avenue Site during the period from approximately 1982 to 1984.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P98_S2	We have joined with other PRP members known as the Frontier Chemical Site Joint Defense Alliance Group to conduct investigation and, if appropriate, remediation activities at the site.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P98_S3	At this stage, we do not have an estimate of likely remediation costs, if any, but do not believe that such costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued a total of $300,000 as of March 31, 2011 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P99_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the current tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to improve our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions, and, during the global recession in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we experienced substantially reduced demand for our products.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, their construction and capital expenditure budgets, changes in their vertical market sectors and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, for example, we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products, generally as a result of the global economic slowdown.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	These lower levels of demand resulted in a 20% decline in net sales from our 2008 fiscal year to our 2010 fiscal year, from $593,800,000 to $476,100,000, despite our acquisition of Pfaff in the middle of our 2009 fiscal year.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	This decline in net sales resulted in a 105% decrease in our income from operations during the same period.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have seen improvement in demand for our products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2011 were $524,065,000, up $47,882,000 or 10.1% from the year ending March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	However, there is no certainty that this improvement will continue in the future.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, approximately 46% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in lower cost countries, in particular in China and Hungary.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements incorporated herein by reference.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S..
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $241,970,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2011) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the euro and the Canadian dollar, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our revolving credit facility contains, and the indenture governing the notes will contain, several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have recently hired a new general counsel who joined us in January 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Managing Director, EMEA.
1005229_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Amherst, New York and, as of March 31, 2011, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 52 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	The limits of this coverage are currently $3,000,000 per occurrence ($2,000,000 through March 31, 2003) and $6,000,000 aggregate ($5,000,000 through March 31, 2003) per year.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Based on this review, we do not believe that any of our pending asbestos-related claims will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2011, there were 516 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	We do not currently pay cash dividends.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	We may reconsider or revise this policy from time to time based upon conditions then existing, including, without limitation, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions under credit agreements or other conditions our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	On May 20, 2011, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $19.98 per share.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P MidCap 400 Index and the Dow Jones US Diversified Industrials.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2006 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for the three years ended March 31, 2011 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	Refer to Results of Operations in Item 7.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company s impairment testing is performed on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company recorded a $107,000,000 goodwill impairment charge in accordance with ASC Topic 350-20 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P3_S2	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	The majority of this charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S is necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P6_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	In July 2008, the Company sold its integrated material handling conveyor systems business, Univeyor A/S and its results of operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S0	In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which is payable over 10 years beginning in August 2004.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S2	The full amount of this note has been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S3	Principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S4	All interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P8_S5	Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Discontinued Operations.
1005229_11_ITEM6_P9_S0	Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable and subordinated debt.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations, except in the section entitled Discontinued Operations.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position or secure material.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes and lifting and rigging tools.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is focused on commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by its superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 136-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our directed sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on improvement of the fundamentals including market expansion, a high degree of customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the course of our history, we have managed through many business cycles and our strong cash flow profile has helped us grow and expand globally.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We stand with a strong capital structure which includes sufficient cash reserves, significant revolver availability with an expiration of May 2013, fixed-rate long-term debt which expires in 2019 and a strong cash flow business profile.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We believe our liquidity strength and operational cost management actions have enabled us to withstand the recent global economic downturn.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	During fiscal 2010 we initiated projects to strategically reorganize our North American hoist and rigging operations, which were essentially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	The projects included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P3_S5	The closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately 500,000 square feet of manufacturing space (or approximately 25% of total manufacturing space) and we expect to generate annual savings estimated at approximately $15,000,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Additionally our revenue base is now more geographically diverse than at any time in our Company s history, with approximately 46% derived from customers outside the U.S. in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in different global economies at different times.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our product.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have consistently improved through April 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, currency exchange and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments and actuators.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by continuing and focusing our sales and marketing activities directed toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, construction, entertainment, mining and food processing.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our fiscal 2009 acquisition of Pfaff is enhancing our European market penetration as well as strengthening our global actuator offering.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Further, we continue to invest in emerging market penetration, including the geographic regions of Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P6_S5	We complement these activities with continued investments in new product development, particularly products with global reach.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to manage our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduction of defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduction of warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We purchase approximately $25,000,000 to $35,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural and others.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Some of our steel costs have increased during this quarter primarily with regards to forged bar as the result of higher scrap and alloy surcharges.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on opportunities for international market penetration and product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment, and we are effectively managing through a global economic cycle.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	While we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy, we have weathered the current economic cycle with our strong capital structure, including a solid cash position and flexible cost base, aggressively addressing costs and restructuring to enhance future margin opportunities.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Fiscal 2011 sales were $524,065,000, up 10.1%, or $47,882,000 compared with fiscal 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of $52,785,000 in volume resulting from the economic recovery and market share gains.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Further, price increases resulted in a $4,651,000 increase in sales.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	These increases were offset by a reduction of sales of $2,695,000 from the October 2009 divestiture of our American Lifts business as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $6,828,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	In fiscal 2010 sales were $476,183,000, down 21.5%, or $130,525,000 compared with fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S5	Our Pfaff acquisition contributed $71,500,000 to our sales for fiscal 2010 with the remaining business being down 28.1%, or $158,000,000, excluding Pfaff.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S6	The decline in sales was primarily due to volume decline resulting from the global economic slow down.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P12_S7	The divestiture of our American Lift business as well as fewer shipping days also contributed to lower sales in FY 2010 by approximately $5,000,000 but was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3,500,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our gross profit was approximately 126,052,000, 115,939,000, and 173,701,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The fiscal 2011 increase in gross profit of 10,113,000 is the result of a $12,800,000 increase in volume, a $6,700,000 increase in restructuring benefits, $1,500,000 increase in savings on U.S. health and pension expenses, offset by a decrease of $6,800,000 from inefficiencies in our forgings operation, a decrease of $1,800,000 for increases in our product liability and asbestos related reserves, a decrease of $1,800,000 for increases in costs of materials, and freight and a decrease of $487,000 for currency translation, and other.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The fiscal 2010 decline in gross profit of $57,762,000 or 33.3% compared with fiscal 2009 was mostly due to under absorption of costs due to lower volume in all markets.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Restructuring charges related to factory consolidation of approximately $4,500,000 as well as a reserve related to an atypical product liability claim of $2,900,000 also contributed to lower margin in fiscal 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling expenses were $62,910,000, $64,464,000, and $72,620,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 12.0%, 13.5% and 12.0% in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Decreases in fiscal 2011 selling expense of $1,554,000 or 2.4% are due to reorganization efforts specifically in the Company s North American sales operations, partially offset by investments in non-U.S markets and commissions on higher sales.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Decreases in fiscal 2010 selling expense of $8,156,000 or 11.3% reflect aggressive efforts to reduce or eliminate costs as well as lower salaries, benefits and commissions by $3,300,000 on lower volume, offset by $500,000 in increased variable compensation expense.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative expenses were $40,592,000, $36,892,000 and $37,721,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Fiscal 2011 general and administrative expenses increased by $3,700,000 or 10.0% primarily due to the Company s investments in its management team in Asia and new product development.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Fiscal 2010 general and administrative expenses decreased by $829,000 or 2.2% primarily due to lower pension/group health benefit costs, lower bad debt expense and other miscellaneous items, partially offset by increased variable compensation expense.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Restructuring charges of $2,200,000, $16,519,000 and $1,921,000, or 0.4%, 3.5% and 0.3% of net sales were recorded in fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Fiscal 2010 restructuring charges resulted from the consolidation of our North American sales force, early retirement benefits offered and costs associated with the closure and downsizing of manufacturing facilities.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Restructuring charges for fiscal 2011 were less than restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 as the activities initiated in fiscal 2010 were essentially complete by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $107,000,000 ($5.67 per diluted share) associated with goodwill.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Interest and debt expense was $13,532,000, $13,225,000 and $13,148,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The fiscal 2011 $3,041,000 gain primarily is the result of the market recovery and sale of securities previously impaired in fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	In fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a $4,000,000 charge related to unrealized losses on securities that were determined to be other than temporary in nature.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The unusual percentage experienced during the year ended March 31, 2011 is related to the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $42,983,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The effective rate for fiscal 2010 was positively impacted by foreign tax benefits and from U.S. state net operating loss benefits.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations was adjusted for the $107,000,000 impairment charge.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	After excluding the impact of the $107,000,000 impairment charge, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 36.8%.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The $26,587,000 decrease in fiscal 2011 relative to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increase in cash used for working capital needed to fund the growing sales as well as completion of restructuring activities.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Favorable changes in the net working capital effects on cash flows from operating activities included $3,739,000 in trade accounts payable, and $4,298,000 in accrued and other non-current liabilities, partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable of $17,191,000, inventory of $31,325,000 and prepaid expenses and other assets of $7,347,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $29,867,000 in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $30,364,000 compared to fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 relative to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower operating performance on lower sales as a result of the continued weakness in the global economy as well as cash payments related to restructuring activities, partially offset by improved working capital management.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Favorable changes, as compared to fiscal 2009, in the net working capital effects on cash flows from operating activities included $19,819,000 in inventory, $7,495,000 in trade accounts payable, and $1,821,000 in accrued and other non-current liabilities, partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable of $13,888,000 and prepaid expenses and other assets of $2,746,000.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The fiscal 2011 increase in cash used of $2,994,000 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $5,298,000 increase for capital expenditures which included $3,642,000 as the initial investment in our global enterprise resource planning system and a $2,360,000 decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets offset by a $4,799,000 increase in cash generated from the net sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The fiscal 2010 decrease in cash used of $64,155,000 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of $52,779,000 of cash used in fiscal 2009 for the Pfaff acquisition as well as lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	The fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounts included $12,543,000, $7,245,000 and $12,245,000 for capital expenditures.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net cash generated by financing activities was $15,794,000 in fiscal 2011 compared with net cash used by financing activities of $5,418,000 and $22,527,000 in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in cash generated by financing activities for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the refinancing of the $124,855,000 outstanding 8 7/8% Notes with a new issuance of $150,000,000 7 7/8% Notes.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Offsetting the proceeds from the offering was $3,154,000 paid for tender and call redemption premiums on the 8 7/8% Notes and $3,185,000 paid for direct financing costs which have been deferred.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Additional increases in cash from financing activities relate to $443,000 from the change in ESOP debt guarantee offset by $337,000 in net repayments under revolving lines of credit in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	The decrease in cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to less net debt repayment of $4,215,000 and $14,612,000 of payments by the Company related to its divested business, Univeyor in fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 include $0, $291,000 and $421,000, respectively, of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	We believe that our cash on hand, cash flows, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	This belief is dependent upon successful execution of our current business plan which includes cost management, finalizing the facility consolidations and effective working capital utilization.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	No material restrictions exist in accessing cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Additionally we expect to meet our U.S. funding needs without repatriating non-U.S. cash and incurring the incremental U.S. taxes.

1005229_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	As of March 31, 2011, significant unsecured credit lines totalled approximately $10,154,000, of which $464,000 was drawn.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of March 31, 2011, by period of estimated payments due:
1005229_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	As described in Note 12 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	As described in Note 19 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $40 million.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Estimated for our Senior Subordinated Notes due 2/1/19.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	As described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $12,500,000, $7,200,000 and $12,200,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $13,000,000 to $15,000,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	However, U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance, workers compensation insurance, pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P49_S3	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program, divestitures, acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	In May 2002, we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of ASI which comprised the principal business unit in our former Solutions - Automotive segment.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Proceeds from this sale included an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 payable over 10 years.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Due to the uncertainty of its collection, the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	Principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	Accordingly, $396,000, and $531,000 of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal 2011, and 2010 respectively, net of tax.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P51_S5	All interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P53_S6	At March 31, 2011 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $3,166,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 13 to our fiscal 2011 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The pension discount rate assumptions of 5.75%, 6%, and 7.25, as of March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, are primarily based on long-term AA rated corporate bond rates.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in the discount rate for fiscal 2011 resulted in a $4,700,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	The decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2010 resulted in an $33,900,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation as of March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.5% for each of the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 70% equities and 30% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S4	Investment gains of $15,010,000 in fiscal 2011 and $30,549,000 in fiscal 2010 with the fiscal 2011 decrease a result of less volatility in US capital markets in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S5	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 was $32,366,000 and $36,782,000, or 18.2% and 21.8% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S6	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were approximately $7,796,000 and $18,026,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S7	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S8	Pension expense for the March 31, 2012 fiscal year is expected to approximate $9,249,000, which is up from the fiscal 2011 amount of $6,836,000.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S9	The increase is primarily related to an amendment and curtailment charge in fiscal 2011 as described in Note 13.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S10	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2012 fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately $3,704,000 compared to fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P56_S11	The compensation increase assumption of 2% as of March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 8.5%, 8.0% and 8.75% for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Healthcare costs in the United States have increased substantially over the last several years.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	If this trend continues, the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our goodwill balance, $106,055,000 as of March 31, 2011 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
1005229_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Our Duff-Norton reporting unit and Rest of Products reporting unit have goodwill totaling $9,902,000 and $96,153,000, respectively, at March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	As a result of our annual impairment test as of February 28, 2011, the fair market value of our reporting units exceeded net book values and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Fair market value of the Duff-Norton and Rest of the Products reporting units exceeded net book value by approximately 29% and 112%, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, determined using discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	An impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 8%.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of 2.0% after five years for the Duff-Norton reporting unit and 3.25% after five years for the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	These rates reflect our estimate of long-term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long-term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 in the individual reporting units.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 14.0% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	We also consider any additional risk of each individual reporting unit achieving its forecasts, and adjust the weighted-average cost of capital applied when determining each reporting unit s estimated fair value.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S4	For example, a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $450,750 and $8,366,000 for the Duff Norton reporting unit and Rest of the Products reporting unit, respectively, or an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $1,651,000 and $28,557,000 for the Duff-Norton reporting unit and Rest of the Products reporting units, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P71_S5	Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of February 28, 2011, necessitating no Step 2 calculations.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	We currently do not believe that any of our reporting units with goodwill are at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test; however if our actual operating results fall significantly below our projections, if the projected long-term revenue growth rates, profit margins, or terminal rates decline as a result of deteriorating market conditions, and/or the estimated weighted-average cost of capital increases significantly, future testing may indicate impairment of one or more of the Company s reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may likely be impaired.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	During the third quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $39,700,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S. was necessary .
1005229_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	The deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans and insurance reserves and U.S. net operating loss carryforwards.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	During the third quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company determined that it would be in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position in the U.S. at March 31, 2011 primarily due to restructuring-related charges incurred in the U.S. to-date in fiscal 2011, despite our expectations of future profitability.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	We recorded additional adjustments to the valuation allowance totaling $3,283,000 within our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2011 as a result of changes in the amounts of net deferred tax assets during the period and changes in judgment related to the expected realization of deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company continues to believe that the strategic reorganization of its North American hoist and rigging operations that commenced in fiscal 2010 and which the Company substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will result in an estimated $15,000,000 in annual cost savings and such savings are ramping up during fiscal 2011 and into fiscal 2012.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The recording of this non-cash charge does not impact the Company s ability to realize the economic benefit of its deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards on future tax returns.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	In future periods, the allowance could be reduced or reversed based on sufficient objectively verifiable evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three year period.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	If we were to experience an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed NOL carryforward period.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	The amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built-in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	On April 1, 2010, the Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06 ).
1005229_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	ASU 2010-06 amends ASC Topic 820 to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Specifically ASU 2010-06 requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers, the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3 and information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-17 Revenue Recognition Milestone Method (Topic 605) Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition ( ASU 2010-17 ), which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	A vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (Topic 350) Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASU 2010-28).
1005229_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	ASU 2010-28 amends the criteria for performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing Step 2 if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	The Company will adopt ASU 2010-28 in fiscal 2012 and any impairment to be recorded upon adoption, if any, will be recognized as an adjustment to the Company s beginning retained earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-28 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-29 ( ASU 2010-29 ) which address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations (Topic 805).
1005229_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	This ASU specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	This ASU also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	ASU 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU; however, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended March 31, 2009 the Company adopted the measurement date provisions and certain other provisions of FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Plans .
1005229_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 27, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, and actuators.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	The Company s material handling products are sold globally principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P8_S3	During fiscal 2011, approximately 54% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Our Mexican subsidiary closes three months earlier to facilitate consolidated reporting.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The carrying value of the Company s current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair values based upon the relatively short maturity of those instruments.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the year.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P14_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	There were losses, including changes in the fair value of derivatives, of approximately $452,000 on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	Including changes in the fair value of derivatives, there were gains of $344,000 and losses of $3,018,000 on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company recorded a gain of $3,330,000 related to the settlement in the form of cash proceeds and a note receivable which was collected in fiscal 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P17_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P17_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	See Note 9 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 11 to 18 years.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Cost of approximately 46% of inventories at March 31, 2011 (52% at March 31, 2010) has been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment (income) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Research and development costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $2,947,000, $2,592,000, and $4,451,000 for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P36_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company has established an allowance for returns based upon historical trend rates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to conform with current year reporting presentation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	( Pfaff-silberblau or Pfaff ), a Kissing, Germany based company with a leading European position in lifting, material handling and actuator products.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	This strategic acquisition continued the execution of the Company s strategic plan to grow its revenue in complementary product lines and also broaden that revenue in non-U.S. markets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	Pfaff-silberblau complements the Company s existing material handling business in Europe and the U.S. and creates a global actuator business when combined with the Company s U.S. based Duff-Norton actuator business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S3	The Company is creating value from this acquisition through integrating the Pfaff business with the Columbus McKinnon European and U.S. based material handling businesses and Duff-Norton.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S4	Value is being created by cross selling products among these groups as well as reducing costs through business integration and procurement activities.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P46_S5	The results of Pfaff-silberblau are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Pfaff s revenue and net loss from the date of acquisition through March 31, 2009 totaled $43,498,000 and $13,942,000 respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	This transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisition of Pfaff-silberblau was $52,779,000 in cash and acquisition costs.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	The acquisition was funded with existing cash.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon a valuation of respective fair values.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S4	The identifiable intangible assets consisted of trademarks with a value of $6,101,000 (18 year estimated useful life), customer relationships with a value of $15,092,000 (11 year estimated useful life), and technology with a value of $806,000 (14 year estimated useful life).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P48_S5	The excess consideration over fair value was recorded as goodwill and approximated $27,769,000, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	As part of the continuing strategic evaluation of its businesses, the Company determined that its integrated material handling conveyor systems business (Univeyor A/S) no longer provided a strategic fit with its long-term growth and operational objectives.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	On July 25, 2008, the Company completed the sale of Univeyor A/S, which business represented the majority of the Company s former Solutions segment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 205-20-45-1, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operations , the results of operations of Univeyor A/S have been classified as discontinued operations in the condensed statements of operations and statements of cash flows presented herein.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	In connection with the sale of Univeyor A/S on July 25, 2008, the Company used cash on hand to repay $15,191,000 in amounts outstanding on Univeyor s lines of credit and fixed term bank debt.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Income from discontinued operations presented herein includes payments received on a note receivable related to the fiscal 2002 disposal of Automatic Systems, Inc.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial viability of the debtor, the note was recorded at the estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	The note has a carrying value of $214,000 at March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Summarized statements of operations for discontinued operations are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	During fiscal 2010, as part of the continuing strategic evaluation of its businesses, the Company determined that its American Lifts business no longer provided a strategic fit with its long-term growth and operational objectives.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The American Lifts business manufactured powered lift tables which enhance workplace ergonomics and were sold primarily to customers in the general manufacturing, construction, and air cargo industries.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	On October 30, 2009, the Company sold this business to a strategic buyer for $2,400,000 in cash.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	A $1,055,000 pre-tax gain on the sale is included in other income, net in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	American Lifts has not been treated as a discontinued operation as its results from operations were immaterial to the overall consolidated financial results of the Company.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary from asset/liability to asset/liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	When valuing our derivative portfolio, the Company uses readily observable market data in conjunction with commonly used valuation models.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	Consequently, the Company designates our derivatives as Level 2.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss and other comprehensive loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	During fiscal 2009, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain marketable securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P71_S3	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company sold a portion of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately $1,852,000 and $606,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 include the Company s reporting units that are used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual or interim basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement , as well as property, plant and equipment in circumstances when the Company determines that those assets are impaired under the provisions of ASC Topic 360-10-35-17 Property Plant and Equipment Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	Liabilities that are measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2010 include the measurement of termination benefits in connection with the Company s restructuring plan under the provisions of ASC Topic 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations .
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company applied the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of February 28, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	Step I of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value for each of the Company s reporting units.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S2	The fair values for the Company s reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S3	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S4	To estimate the fair values of reporting units, the Company uses significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S5	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal growth rates, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P73_S6	See Note 9 for the results of the Company s February 28, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The excess of FIFO over LIFO cost decreased primarily due to LIFO liquidation resulting in a $500,000 positive impact on fiscal 2011 income.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	During 2011 the Company wrote off $411,000 in inventory related to restructuring activities.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings within investment (income) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company sold nearly all of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately $1,852,000 and $606,000 respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2011:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2011 are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company considered the nature of the investments, causes of previous impairments, the severity and duration of unrealized losses and other factors and determined that the unrealized losses at March 31, 2011 were temporary in nature.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	Net realized (losses) gains related to sales of marketable securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $2,358,037, $(238,000), and $7,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2010:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2010 are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Net unrealized gains (losses) included in the balance sheet amounted to $884,000 at March 31, 2011 and $2,628,000 at March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	The amounts, net of related income tax expense of $309,000 and $920,000 at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	In addition to the above, the Company has included unrealized gains of $804,000, net of tax, within accumulated other comprehensive loss related to an investment recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	Consolidated property, plant, and equipment of the Company consisted of the following:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	Buildings include assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $3,147,000 for each of the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Machinery, equipment, and leasehold improvements include assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $5,940,000 and $5,613,000 for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	Accumulated depreciation includes accumulated amortization of the assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $3,724,000 and $1,910,000 at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, was $9,286,000, $10,613,000, and $9,592,000 for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S5	The Company has four reporting units.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S6	Only two of the four reporting units carry goodwill at March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P93_S7	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,902,000 and $9,838,000 at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings design, manufacturing, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $96,153,000 and $95,296,000 at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S3	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S4	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P95_S5	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	During fiscal 2009, the generally weak economic conditions resulted in a rapid decline in business, a reduction in forecasted cash flows, and an increase in capital costs as a result of tightening credit markets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the fair value of its Rest of Products reporting unit was less than its carrying value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	Following this assessment, ASC Topic 350-20-35-8 required the Company to perform a second step in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in this reporting unit and to compare it to its carrying value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S3	The activities in the second step included hypothetically valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the impaired reporting unit using market participant assumptions, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S4	As a result of this assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $107,000,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P96_S5	None of the charge related to goodwill was deductible for tax purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	As a result of the assessments for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company concluded that the balances of goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired, and therefore did not record impairment charges during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P98_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	Intangible assets at March 31, 2011 are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	Intangible assets at March 31, 2010 were as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	All of the Company s intangibles assets are considered to have finite lives and are amortized.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	The weighted-average amortization periods are 18 years for trademarks, 11 years for customer relationships and 14 years for other.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	Total amortization expense was $1,778,000, $1,876,000, and $998,000 for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P103_S3	Based on the current amount of intangible assets, the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding five years is expected to be $1,890,000, $1,860,000, $1,830,000, and $1,810,000, and $1,780,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company uses derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency exposures.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	All derivative instruments must be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S3	For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss, or AOCL, and is reclassified to earnings when the underlying transaction has an impact on earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S4	The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss in the Company s consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P104_S5	For derivatives not classified as cash flow hedges, all changes in market value are recorded as a foreign currency exchange (gain) loss in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P107_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $10,342,000 and all contracts mature within thirteen months of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties on its financial instruments.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	All counterparties have investment grade credit ratings.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P108_S2	The Company anticipates that these counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	Also, dividends on those ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	Rather, since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation expense is recorded.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P167_S3	Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares of the Company s common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P173_S2	Diluted earnings per share include any dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted stock.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P173_S3	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 224,000 common shares and 25,000 common shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for fiscal 2011 because they were antidilutive as a result of the Company s net loss.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P173_S4	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 178,000 common shares and 15,000 common shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for fiscal 2010 because they were antidilutive as a result of the Company s net loss.

1005229_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	Prior to the adoptions of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company maintained several different stock plans, specifically: 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, collectively referred to as the Prior Stock Plans .

1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2011 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 521,018 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2011 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 384,873 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $18.46 as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $39,610, $324,000, and $773,000 during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P186_S5	As of March 31, 2011, there are 0 options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	The fair value of shares that vested was $9.33, $12.32, and $4.20 during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2011 was approximately $56,432.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	As of March 31, 2011, $1,105,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	Exercise prices for options outstanding as of March 31, 2011, ranged from $5.46 to $28.45.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2011:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2011:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P194_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	The weighted-average fair value of the options was $9.29, $8.18, and $14.77 for options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P196_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	Restricted shares for employees vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2011 is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2011 is $1,498,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P200_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 was $379,976 and $122,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s performance over a three year period depending on the Company s total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	Performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based on fair value on date of grant, the number of shares ultimately expected to vest and the vesting period.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P201_S3	For accounting purposes, the performance shares are considered to have a market condition.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P201_S4	The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value of the award and, thus compensation expense is recognized on this type of award provided that the requisite service is rendered (regardless of whether the market condition is achieved).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of each performance share granted under the LTIP on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	Expected volatility is based upon the daily historical volatilities of Columbus McKinnon s stock and our peer group.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	The risk free rate was based on zero coupon government bonds at the time of grant.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the three year performance period.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2011 is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	Total unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested performance share awards as of March 31, 2011 was $1,042,000 and is expected be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	The fair value of performance shares that vested during the year ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 was $0 and $127,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	The Company also maintains a Restricted Stock Plan.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company charges compensation expense and shareholders equity for the market value of shares ratably over the restricted period.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P207_S2	Grantees that remain continuously employed with the Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P207_S3	As of March 31, 2011, there were no shares available for future grants under the Restricted Stock Plan.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	No restricted stock was granted in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P208_S1	As of March 31, 2011, there are 1,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding with a weighted average fair value grant price of $30.72.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, a total of 17,664, 21,536, and 12,436 shares of stock, respectively, were granted under the LTIP to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P209_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $15.85, $13.00, and $20.96 for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P209_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $450,000, $280,000, and $260,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	Subject to limited exceptions, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company s common shares or announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common shares.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P210_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P211_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	Future cash payments related to reserves for nonasbestos claims are not discounted due to their underlying uncertainty.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S2	Reserves for certain asbestos related claims are discounted using a risk free interest rate which ranged from 0.30% to 4.51% as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S3	The aggregate amount of undiscounted reserves and discounted amounts were $21,831,000 and $1,255,000, respectively, as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S4	The aggregate amount of undiscounted reserves and discounted amounts were $24,535,000 and $1,481,000, respectively, as of March 31, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P212_S5	Payments over each of the next five years for the portion of asbestos reserves that the Company discounts are expected to be $200,000 per year and $3,400,000 thereafter.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 7).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	The per occurrence limits on our self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P216_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P216_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2012.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P217_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P217_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P217_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability, including related legal costs, to range between $7,000,000 and $17,000,000, using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 18 to 30 years from March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S1	The Company's estimation of its discounted asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $11,000,000 which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S3	This liability may fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $500,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P218_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2010, as part of the business reorganization plan, the Company initiated strategic consolidation of its North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	The process included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	The closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately 500,000 square feet of manufacturing space and the generation of annual savings estimated at approximately $15,000,000.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	Restructuring charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 relate to the continuation of the consolidation of the North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P220_S1	Charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 included a write off of production supplies in the amount of $411,000 and other facility related costs of $2,208,000, offset by a gain in the sale of a closed facility in the amount of $419,000.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	Also, in fiscal 2010, the Company consolidated its North American sales force and offered certain of its employees an incentive to voluntarily retire early.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	Charges related to the early retirement program were approximately $5,732,000 and consist of two benefits: a paid leave of absence and an enhanced pension benefit.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P221_S2	The payments for the paid leave of absence are being made to the employees in installments on their regular pay dates.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	Charges for the enhanced pension benefit of $2,012,000 are recorded in long-term pension liabilities.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P222_S1	Long-term pension liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	Restructuring reserves as of March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010 consisted primarily of accrued severance costs and were $47,000 and $2,755,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of the activity related to restructuring reserves (in thousands):
1005229_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	The sources and tax effects of the difference were as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $42,983,000 (or $2.26 per diluted share) included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P227_S1	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S and three of the Company s subsidiaries are necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	The valuation allowance includes $1,240,000 and $545,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	The increase in foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to net operating losses in three of the Company s subsidiaries.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P230_S2	The Company s valuation allowance related to foreign subsidiaries net operating losses have lives that range from five years to indefinite.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	The Federal net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2030 to 2031.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P231_S1	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2015 through 2030.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P231_S2	The Federal tax credits have expiration dates starting in 2014.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P232_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P233_S1	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P234_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income (loss) of $12,403,000, $8,769,000, and $(16,119,000) for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P234_S1	Income (loss) from discontinued operations reported in the statements of operations is net of tax expense (benefit) of $243,000, $326,000, and $(14,442,000) for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P234_S2	As of March 31, 2011, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $79,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P234_S3	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P234_S4	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P235_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P235_S1	The tax benefits to the Company from these transactions, were recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as a reduction of income tax expense, was $68,000 and ($5,600) in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P235_S2	This tax shortfall (benefit) has also been recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as an increase (decrease) in deferred tax assets.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P236_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P237_S0	The Company had $96,000 and $130,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P237_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P238_S0	Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2011 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and local and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P239_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for 2007 and 2008, resulting in a reduction of AMT credit carry forwards of $256,000.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P239_S2	Current examinations include an IRS audit of the Company s 2009 return, a German audit of 2005 through 2007, and various state audits.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company s major jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P240_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2008 and in Germany for tax years prior to December 31, 2005.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations prior to March 31, 2012.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P242_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $7,195,143, $5,463,000, and $5,695,000, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P242_S1	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2011 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P243_S0	The following information sets forth the condensed consolidating summary financial information of the parent and guarantors, which guarantee the 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes, and the nonguarantors.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P243_S1	The guarantors are wholly owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P244_S0	As of and for the year ended March 31, 2011:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P245_S0	ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P246_S0	Historically the Company had two operating and reportable segments, Products and Solutions.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P246_S1	The Solutions segment engaged primarily in the design, fabrication and installation of integrated material handling conveyor systems and service and in the design and manufacture of tire shredders, lift tables and light-rail systems.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P246_S2	In fiscal 2009, the Company re-evaluated its operating and reportable segments in connection with the discontinuation of its integrated material handling conveyor systems and service business.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P247_S0	Financial information relating to the Company s operations by geographic area is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P248_S0	Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2011 and 2010:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P249_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $39,700,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P249_S1	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S. was necessary.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P250_S0	Note: The per-share net income (loss) for the four quarters may not equal the per share net loss for the year due to rounding.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P251_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:
1005229_11_ITEM8_P252_S0	The deferred taxes associated with the items included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, were $0 and $19,291,000, for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P252_S1	Refer to Note 18 for discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P252_S2	In the period subsequent to our initial recording of the valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, increases and decreases to both the deferred tax assets associated with items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the valuation allowance, have been recorded as offsets to comprehensive income.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P253_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $534,000 charge in the minimum pension liability component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P253_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P253_S2	This is in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, even though the valuation allowance was initially established by a charge against comprehensive income.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P253_S3	This amount will remain indefinitely as a component of minimum pension liability adjustment.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P254_S0	The activity by year related to investments, including reclassification adjustments for activity included in earnings are as follows (all items shown net of tax):
1005229_11_ITEM8_P255_S0	On April 1, 2010, the Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06 ).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P255_S1	ASU 2010-06 amends ASC Topic 820 to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P255_S2	Specifically ASU 2010-06 requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers, the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3 and information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P256_S0	The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P257_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-17 Revenue Recognition Milestone Method (Topic 605) Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition ( ASU 2010-17 ), which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P257_S1	A vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P258_S0	The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P259_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (Topic 350) Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASU 2010-28).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P259_S1	ASU 2010-28 amends the criteria for performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing Step 2 if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P259_S2	The Company will adopt ASU 2010-28 in fiscal 2012 and any impairment to be recorded upon adoption, if any, will be recognized as an adjustment to the Company s beginning retained earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P259_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-28 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P260_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-29 ( ASU 2010-29 ) which address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations (Topic 805).
1005229_11_ITEM8_P260_S1	This ASU specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P260_S2	This ASU also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P261_S0	ASU 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1005229_11_ITEM8_P261_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU; however, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of March 31, 2011, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 20111 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P4_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria) .
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Columbus McKinnon Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	In our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria .
1005229_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2011, and our report dated May 27, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged attachment, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling our other products.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell our other products through our existing distribution channels in that region.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Pfaff, Shaw-Box and Yale, are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the manufacturing industry capacity utilization, industrial production and the general economic activity indicators, like GDP.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are leading market indicators for the Company.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	US industrial capacity utilization increased to 78.4% in April 2012, trending up from 74.8% in April 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization has also been trending higher for the last seven quarters, reaching 79.8% in March 2012 compared with the trough of 69.6% in June 2009.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The broad, global material handling industry includes the following sectors:
1005229_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The breadth of our products and services enables us to participate in most of these sectors.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	This diversification, together with our extensive and varied distribution channels, minimizes our dependence on any particular product, market or customer.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	We believe that none of our competitors offers the variety of products or services in the markets we serve.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several macro-economic growth drivers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Productivity Enhancement - We believe employers respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Further, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Safety Regulations - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, employers seek safer ways to lift and position loads.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Consolidation of Suppliers - In an effort to reduce costs and increase productivity, our channel partners and end-user customers are increasingly consolidating their suppliers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe that our broad product offering combined with our well established brand names will enable us to benefit from this consolidation and enhance our market share.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Leading North American Market Positions - We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists, alloy and high strength carbon steel chain and attachments, and actuators in North America.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have developed our leading market positions over our 137-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior service.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	Approximately 62% of our U.S. net sales for the year ended March 31, 2012 were from product categories in which we believe we hold the number one market share.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	We believe that the strength of our established products and brands and our leading market positions provide us with significant competitive advantages, including preferred supplier status with a majority of our largest channel partners and end user customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our large installed base of products also provides us with a significant competitive advantage in selling our products to existing customers as well as providing repair and replacement parts.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The following table summarizes the product categories where we believe we are the U.S. market leader:
1005229_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived from survey information collected and provided by our trade associations in 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates based on our market shares of Powered Hoists and Manual Hoists Trolleys, which we believe are good proxies for our Hoist Parts market share because we believe most end-users purchase Hoist Parts from the original equipment supplier.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparison of our net sales to net sales of one of our competitors and to estimates of total market sales from a trade association in 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparing the number of our tire shredders in use and their capacity to estimates of the total number of tires shredded published by a trade association in 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Market share and market position are internal estimates derived from both the number of bids we win as a percentage of the total projects for which we submit bids and from estimates of our competitors net sales based on their relative position in distributor catalogues in 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe we offer the most comprehensive product lines in the markets we serve.

1005229_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	The customer base served by national distributors such as W. W. Grainger, which traditionally included smaller industrial companies and consumers, has grown to include large industrial accounts and integrated suppliers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Material handling specialists and integrators that design and assemble systems incorporating hoists, overhead rail systems, trolleys, scissor lift tables, manipulators, air balancers, jib arms and other material handling products to provide end-users with solutions to their material handling problems.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Entertainment equipment distributors that design, supply and install a variety of material handling and rigging equipment for concerts, theaters, ice shows, sporting events, convention centers and night clubs.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Pfaff International Direct - Our German-based Pfaff business markets and sells most of its actuators and certain of its hoist products direct to end-users, providing an additional method to market for us in the European region.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Crane End-Users - We market and sell overhead bridge, jib and gantry cranes, parts and service to end-users through our wholly owned crane builder, Crane Equipment Service, Inc. ( CES ).
1005229_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	CES which includes Abell-Howe, Gaffey and Washington Equipment brands designs, manufactures, installs and services a variety of cranes with capacities up to 100 tons.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Service-After-Sale Distribution Channel - Service-after-sale distributors include our authorized network of 14 chain repair service stations and approximately 260 hoist service and repair stations throughout North America.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	This service network is designed for easy parts and service access for our large installed base of hoists and related equipment in that region.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	OEMs that supply various component parts directly to other industrial manufacturers as well as private branding and packaging of our traditional products for material handling, lifting, positioning and special purpose applications.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that purchase primarily load securing chain and forged attachments.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	We also provide our products to the U.S government for a variety of military applications.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	We maintain customer service departments staffed by trained personnel for all of our sales divisions, and regularly schedule product and service training schools for all customer service representatives and field sales personnel.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Training programs for distribution and service station personnel, as well as for end-users, are scheduled on a regular basis at most of our facilities and in the field.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	We have approximately 260 service and repair stations worldwide that provide local and regional repair, warranty and general service work for distributors and end-users.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P81_S3	End-user trainees attending our various programs include representatives of 3M, Cummins Engine, DuPont, General Electric, John Deere, Praxair and many other industrial and entertainment organizations.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	We also provide, in multiple languages, a variety of collateral material in video, CD-ROM, slide and print format addressing relevant material handling topics such as the care, use and inspection of chains and hoists, and overhead lifting and positioning safety.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	In addition, we sponsor advisory boards made up of representatives of our primary distributors and service-after-sale network members who are invited to participate in discussions focused on improving products and service.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	These boards enable us and our primary distributors to exchange product and market information relevant to industry trends.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2012 was approximately $114,180,000 compared to approximately $89,393,000 at March 31, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P83_S2	Orders for products that are manufactured to customers specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P83_S3	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	The material handling industry remains highly fragmented.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; for tire shredders is Granutech; and for light-rail systems is Gorbel.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	At March 31, 2012, we had 2,549 employees; 1,520 in the U.S./Canada, 66 in Latin America, 736 in Europe and 227 in Asia.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	Approximately 13% of our employees are represented under four separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2013 and April 2015.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; and electro-mechanical components.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our Purchasing Council to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our distribution channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S4	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P89_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency exposures.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements and cross-currency swaps to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	In addition, we use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases and sales denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P92_S2	In 2001, we began implementing Lean improvement techniques in our business which has resulted in inventory reductions in required manufacturing floor area, shorter product lead time and increased productivity.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, castings and electro-mechanical components are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P93_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P93_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P94_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, have not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Coffing Hoist facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $200,000.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	In March of 2007, we also discovered the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Damascus, Virginia hoist plant and have notified the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (the DEQ ).
1005229_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	We filed an application with the DEQ to participate in its voluntary remediation program and have been accepted.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P96_S2	We are currently investigating under the terms of the DEQ Voluntary Remediation Program and, if appropriate, will remediate site conditions at the facility.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P96_S3	At this time, investigative and remediation costs are not expected to be significant.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	In June of 2007, we were identified by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( the DEC ), along with other companies, as a potential responsible party ( PRP ) at the Frontier Chemical Royal Avenue Site in Niagara Falls, New York.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	From 1974 to 1992, the Frontier Royal Avenue Site had been operated as a commercial waste treatment and disposal facility.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	We sent waste sulfuric acid pickling solution generated at our facility in Tonawanda, New York to the Frontier Royal Avenue Site during the period from approximately 1982 to 1984.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P98_S2	We have joined with other PRP members known as the Frontier Chemical Site Joint Defense Alliance Group to conduct investigation and, if appropriate, remediation activities at the site.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P98_S3	We do not believe that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued a total of $356,000 as of March 31, 2012 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to improve our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions, and, during the global recession in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we experienced substantially reduced demand for our products.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, their construction and capital expenditure budgets, changes in their vertical market sectors and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, for example, we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products, generally as a result of the global economic slowdown.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	These lower levels of demand resulted in a 20% decline in net sales from our 2008 fiscal year to our 2010 fiscal year, from $593,800,000 to $476,100,000, despite our acquisition of Pfaff in the middle of our 2009 fiscal year.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	This decline in net sales resulted in a 105% decrease in our income from operations during the same period.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have seen improvement in demand for our products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2012 were $591,945,000, up $67,880,000 or 13.0% from the year ending March 31, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	However, there is no certainty that this improvement will continue in the future.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, approximately 45% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in lower cost countries, in particular in China and Hungary.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $268,654,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2012) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the euro and the Canadian dollar, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Vice President, EMEA.
1005229_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Amherst, New York and, as of March 31, 2012, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 52 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	The limits of this coverage are currently $3,000,000 per occurrence ($2,000,000 through March 31, 2003) and $6,000,000 aggregate ($5,000,000 through March 31, 2003) per year.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Based on this review, we do not believe that any of our pending asbestos-related claims will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2012 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2012, there were 552 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	We do not currently pay cash dividends.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	We may reconsider or revise this policy from time to time based upon conditions then existing, including, without limitation, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions under credit agreements or other conditions our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	On May 22, 2012, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $13.47 per share.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P MidCap 400 Index and the Dow Jones US Diversified Industrials.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2007 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2012 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Refer to Results of Operations in Item 7.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company s impairment testing is performed on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company recorded a $107,000,000 goodwill impairment charge in accordance with ASC Topic 350-20 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P3_S2	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	The majority of this charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S is necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P6_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P7_S0	In July 2008, the Company sold its integrated material handling conveyor systems business, Univeyor A/S and its results of operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S0	In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which is payable over 10 years ending in May 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S2	The full amount of this note has been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S3	Principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S4	All interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P8_S5	Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Discontinued Operations.
1005229_12_ITEM6_P9_S0	Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable and subordinated debt.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations, except in the section entitled Discontinued Operations.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes and rigging tools.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by the Company s superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 137-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	Ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our directed sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on improvement of the fundamentals including market expansion, a high degree of customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the course of our history, we have managed through many business cycles and our solid cash flow profile has helped us grow and expand globally.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We stand with a capital structure which includes sufficient cash reserves, significant revolver availability with an expiration of December 2013, fixed-rate long-term debt which expires in 2019 and a solid cash flow business profile.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	During fiscal 2010 we initiated projects to strategically reorganize our North American hoist and rigging operations, which were essentially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The projects included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately 500,000 square feet of manufacturing space (or approximately 25% of total manufacturing space).
1005229_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Additionally our revenue base is now more geographically diverse than at any time in our Company s history, with approximately 45% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies as well as benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our product.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have improved through April 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, currency exchange and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments and actuators.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, construction, entertainment, mining and food processing.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to manage our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduction of defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduction of warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We purchase approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural and others.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Some of our steel costs have increased during this year as a result of higher scrap and alloy surcharges.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on opportunities for non-U.S. market penetration and product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	While we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our solid capital structure, including our cash position and flexible cost base.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	We are also aggressively addressing costs and restructuring opportunities to enhance future margin opportunities.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Fiscal 2012 sales were $591,945,000, up 13.0%, or $67,880,000 compared with fiscal 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of $43,735,000 in volume resulting from the economic recovery and market share gains.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Price increases resulted in a $13,585,000 increase in sales.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Favorable foreign currency translation impacted sales by $10,560,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	Fiscal 2011 sales were $524,065,000, up 10.1%, or $47,882,000 compared with fiscal 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of $52,785,000 in volume resulting from the economic recovery and market share gains.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S6	Further, price increases resulted in a $4,651,000 increase in sales.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P13_S7	These increases were offset by a reduction of sales of $2,695,000 from the October 2009 divestiture of our American Lifts business as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $6,828,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our gross profit was $157,718,000, $126,052,000, and $115,939,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The fiscal 2012 increase in gross profit of $31,666,000 or 25.1% is the result of $20,941,000 in increased volume, favorable manufacturing variances of $3,655,000, $3,006,000 in less restructuring related expenses included within cost of goods sold, and $2,570,000 from lower product liability expenses partially offset by a pension plan curtailment charge of $1,122,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on gross profit of $2,616,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	The fiscal 2011 increase in gross profit of $10,113,000 is the result of a $12,800,000 increase in volume, a $6,700,000 increase in restructuring benefits, $1,500,000 increase in savings on U.S. health and pension expenses, offset by a decrease of $6,800,000 from inefficiencies in our forgings operation, a decrease of $1,800,000 for increases in our product liability and asbestos related reserves, a decrease of $1,800,000 for increases in costs of materials and freight and a decrease of $487,000 for currency translation and other.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling expenses were $64,860,000, $62,910,000, and $64,464,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 11.0%, 12.0% and 13.5% in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	The increase in fiscal 2012 selling expense is primarily the result of increasing revenues year over year.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	Decreases in fiscal 2011 selling expense of $1,554,000 or 2.4% are due to reorganization efforts specifically in the Company s North American sales operations, partially offset by investments in non-U.S markets and commissions on higher sales.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	General and administrative expenses were $46,677,000, $40,592,000 and $36,892,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses were 7.9%, 7.7% and 7.7% in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1005229_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	As described in Note 19 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $40 million.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Estimated for our Senior Subordinated Notes due 2/1/19 and other senior debt.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	As described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

1005229_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $13,765,000, $12,543,000 and $7,245,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $14,000,000 to $17,000,000, excluding acquisitions and strategic partnerships.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	However, U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance, workers compensation insurance, pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program, divestitures, acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	In May 2002, we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of ASI which comprised the principal business unit in our former Solutions - Automotive segment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Proceeds from this sale included an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 payable over 10 years.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Due to the uncertainty of its collection, the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	Accordingly, $1,052,000, and $396,000 of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal 2012, and 2011 respectively, net of tax.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	All interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P52_S6	The Company expects that the loan will be fully collected by the end of fiscal 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.

1005229_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 13 to our fiscal 2012 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The pension discount rate assumptions of 4.70%, 5.75%, and 6.0%, as of March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in the discount rate for fiscal 2012 resulted in a $11,500,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2011 resulted in an $4,700,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation as of March 31, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.5% for each of the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 70% equities and 30% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $65,123,000 and $32,366,000, or 30.3% and 18.2% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were approximately $5,974,000 and $7,796,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	Pension expense for the March 31, 2013 fiscal year is expected to approximate $7,137,000, slightly less than the fiscal 2012 amount of $7,547,000, which includes a curtailment charge of $1,120,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S8	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2013 fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately $4,412,000 compared to fiscal 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P57_S9	The compensation increase assumption of 2% as of March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 8.0% 8.5%, and 8.0% for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Healthcare costs in the United States have increased substantially over the last several years.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	If this trend continues, the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	At March 31, 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,700,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our goodwill balance, $106,435,000 as of March 31, 2012 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
1005229_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	Our Duff-Norton reporting unit and Rest of Products reporting unit have goodwill totaling $9,821,000 and $96,614,000, respectively, at March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which our reporting units operate.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance .
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	The balance of the valuation allowance at March 31, 2012 is $53,325,000.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S. was necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	The deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans, insurance reserves, U.S. tax credits, and U.S. net operating loss carryforwards.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P76_S5	The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	During the third quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company determined that it would be in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position in the U.S. at March 31, 2011 primarily due to restructuring-related charges incurred in the U.S. to-date in fiscal 2011, despite our expectations of future profitability.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The recording of this non-cash charge does not impact the Company s ability to realize the economic benefit of its deferred tax assets (including those related to net operating loss carryforwards) amounting to $58,226,000 on a gross basis at March 31, 2012 on future tax returns.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	In future periods, the allowance could be reduced or reversed based on sufficient objectively verifiable evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three year period.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	If we were to experience an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed NOL carryforward period.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	The amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built-in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Among the new provisions in ASU 2011-05 was a requirement for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented (for both interim and annual financial statements); however this reclassification requirement is indefinitely deferred by ASU 2011-12 and will be further deliberated by the FASB at a future date.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2011-11).
1005229_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The update requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods therein.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The amendment permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	If, after assessing relevant events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to follow the existing provisions of the two-step impairment test.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S5	We adopted the new guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test, which we tested as of our measurement date of February 29, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P86_S6	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2011-05 ), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	The issuance of ASU 2011-5 is intended to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The guidance in ASU 2011-5 supersedes the presentation options in ASC Topic 220 and facilitates convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) ( ASU 2011-04 ).
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards ) on fair value measurements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011-04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and IFRS.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	The amendments in this ASU are required to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P88_S5	The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	In March 2011, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 114.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	This SAB revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in the codification of the Staff Accounting Bulletin Series.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	This update is intended to make the relevant interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance issued as a part of the FASB s Codification.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	The principal changes involve revision or removal of accounting guidance references and other conforming changes to ensure consistency of referencing through the SAB Series.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P89_S4	The effective date for SAB 114 was March 28, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_12_ITEM7_P91_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2012, 45% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, European currencies, the Mexican peso and the Chinese Yuan.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $1,200,000 on our net income.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements and cross-currency swaps in place to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The notional amount of these derivatives is $11,120,000 and all contracts mature by September 30, 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These contracts are not designated as hedges.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to hedge changes in the value of recorded foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $2,597,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases and sales, including multi-year contracts related to capital project sales, denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $10,098,000 and all contracts mature within twenty-seven months of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	At March 31, 2012, we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	At March 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 99% and 99% of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	At those dates, we had approximately $112,000 and $473,000, respectively, of outstanding variable rate debt.
1005229_12_ITEM7A_P7_S4	A 1% fluctuation in interest rates would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by less than $100,000 in fiscal 2012 and 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2012 and 2011 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 30, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) is a leading designer, marketer and manufacturer of material handling products and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, and actuators.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	The Company s material handling products are sold globally principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	During fiscal 2012, approximately 55% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	Advertising expenses were $3,500,000, $3,700,000, and $3,020,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	Approximately 13% of the Company s employees are represented by four separate U.S. and Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2013 and April 2015.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our Mexican subsidiary closes one month early to facilitate consolidated reporting.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	The carrying value of the Company s current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair values based upon the relatively short maturity of those instruments.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the year.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P11_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	There were losses, including changes in the fair value of derivatives, of approximately $316,000 on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P12_S3	Including changes in the fair value of derivatives, there were losses of $452,000 and gains of $344,000 on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P13_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P13_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	See Note 9 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 3 to 18 years.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Cost of approximately 44% of inventories at March 31, 2012 (46% at March 31, 2011) has been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Research and development costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $4,497,000, $2,947,000, and $2,592,000 for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P34_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to conform with current year reporting presentation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	On December 13, 2011, the Company acquired 80% of the outstanding common shares of Yale Lifting Solutions (Pty) LTD ( YLS PTY ) located in Magaliesburg, South Africa, a privately owned company with annual sales of less than $10,000,000.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company now owns 100% of YLS PTY.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	YLS PTY has been representing the Company s Yale brand of products as a distributor to the South African mining industry for over 14 years.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company had previously owned 20% of the outstanding common shares of YLS PTY which the Company accounted for as a cost method investment as it did not exercise significant influence over YLS PTY s operating or financial policies.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	The carrying amount of the cost method investment prior to the acquisition of the remaining 80% interest was under $1,000.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P45_S3	The results of YLS PTY are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	The acquisition of YLS PTY is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805 Business Combinations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	The aggregate purchase consideration for the remaining 80% ownership of Yale Lifting Solutions (Pty) LTD was $3,356,000.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	The acquisition date fair value of the Company s 20% interest in YLS PTY was $850,000 and resulted in an $850,000 gain, which is recorded within other income, net in the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P47_S3	The acquisition was funded with existing cash.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P47_S4	The purchase price and fair value of the previously held 20% ownership interest has been assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	The identifiable intangible assets consist of customer contracts with a value of $397,000 (3 year estimated useful life).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	The excess consideration over fair value was recorded as goodwill and approximates $1,470,000, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Income from discontinued operations presented herein includes payments received on a note receivable related to the fiscal 2002 disposal of Automatic Systems, Inc.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial viability of the debtor, the note was recorded at the estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The note has a remaining balance of $214,000 at March 31, 2012 which is expected to be fully collected by the end of fiscal 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Summarized statements of operations for discontinued operations are as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	During fiscal 2010, as part of the continuing strategic evaluation of its businesses, the Company determined that its American Lifts business no longer provided a strategic fit with its long-term growth and operational objectives.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	The American Lifts business manufactured powered lift tables which enhance workplace ergonomics and were sold primarily to customers in the general manufacturing, construction, and air cargo industries.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	On October 30, 2009, the Company sold this business to a strategic buyer for $2,400,000 in cash.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	A $1,055,000 pre-tax gain on the sale is included in other income, net in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	American Lifts has not been treated as a discontinued operation as its results from operations were immaterial to the overall consolidated financial results of the Company.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	When valuing our derivative portfolio, the Company uses readily observable market data in conjunction with commonly used valuation models.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	Consequently, the Company designates our derivatives as Level 2.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive loss, to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	During fiscal 2009, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain marketable securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P68_S3	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company sold a portion of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately $1,852,000 and $606,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Assets that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2011 and 2010 include the Company s reporting units that are used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual or interim basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement, as well as property, plant and equipment in circumstances when the Company determines that those assets are impaired under the provisions of ASC Topic 360-10-35-17 Property Plant and Equipment Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	Liabilities that are measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2010 include the measurement of termination benefits in connection with the Company s restructuring plan under the provisions of ASC Topic 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Assets and liabilities that are measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2012 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of YLS PTY described in Note 3.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	There were LIFO liquidations resulting in $2,173,000 and $500,000 positive impacts on fiscal 2012 and 2011 income, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	There were no LIFO liquidations in fiscal 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	During fiscal 2011 the Company wrote off $411,000 in inventory related to restructuring activities, which is classified in cost of products sold.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings within investment income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P78_S3	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company sold nearly all of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of gains of approximately $1,852,000 and $606,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2012:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2012 are as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company considered the nature of the investments, causes of previous impairments, the severity and duration of unrealized losses and other factors and determined that the unrealized losses at March 31, 2012 were temporary in nature.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S5	The Company has four reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P91_S6	Only two of the four reporting units carry goodwill at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S2	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S3	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S4	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P94_S5	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	The fair values of our defined benefit plans consolidated assets were determined using the fair value hierarchy of inputs described in Note 5.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	The fair values by category of inputs as of March 31, 2012 were as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	Level 1 fixed income securities consist of fixed income mutual funds with quoted market prices.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	Level 2 equity securities consist of short term investments stated at net asset value which approximates fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	Fair value of Level 3 fixed income securities at the beginning of the year was $15,872,000.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	These fixed income securities consist primarily of insurance contracts which are carried at their liquidation value based on actuarial calculations and the terms of the contracts.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	The guidance in ASC Topic 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and covered in sub-topic 718-40 "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released to employees, rather than based on their original cost.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	Also, dividends on those ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P164_S2	Rather, since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation expense is recorded.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P164_S3	Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares of the Company s common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P165_S1	An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a deduction from shareholders equity.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	Effective January 1, 2012 the ESOP was closed to new hires.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P166_S1	Prior to this date, substantially all of the Company s U.S. non-union employees were participants in the ESOP.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	Contributions to the plan result from the release of collateralized shares as debt service payments are made.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	Compensation expense amounting to $416,000, $466,000, and $408,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is recorded based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at their fair market value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P167_S2	Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt service.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	At March 31, 2012 and 2011, 440,000 and 513,000 of ESOP shares, respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants accounts.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	At March 31, 2012 and 2011, 61,000 and 88,000 of ESOP shares were pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P170_S2	Diluted earnings per share include any dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted stock.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P170_S3	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 184,000, 249,000 and 193,000 common shares were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, because they were antidilutive.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	The weighted-average common stock outstanding shown above is net of unallocated ESOP shares (see Note 14).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, applying the modified prospective method.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P173_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P173_S2	Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	Prior to the adoptions of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company maintained several different stock plans, specifically: 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, collectively referred to as the Prior Stock Plans .
1005229_12_ITEM8_P174_S1	The specifics of each of these plans are discussed below.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	Stock based compensation expense was $2,913,000, $2,484,000, and $1,824,000 for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P176_S1	The Company recognizes expense for all share based awards over the service period, which is the shorter of the period until the employees retirement eligibility dates or the service period for the award for awards expected to vest.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P176_S2	Accordingly, expense is generally reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P176_S3	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	On July 26, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the LTIP.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P178_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 1,250,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the Prior Stock Plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Stock Plans.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P178_S3	As of March 31, 2012, 1,099,000 shares remain for future grants.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	Under the plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of our Plan.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (Non-Qualified Plan) and an Incentive Stock Option Plan (Incentive Plan).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P181_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2012 is as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2012 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 458,000 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2012 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 337,000 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $16.29 as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $1,466,000, $40,000, and $324,000 during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P184_S5	As of March 31, 2012, there are 0 options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	The fair value of shares that vested was $8.96, $9.33, and $12.32 during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2012 was approximately $1,438,000.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P186_S1	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	As of March 31, 2012, $1,464,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	Exercise prices for options outstanding as of March 31, 2012, ranged from $5.46 to $28.45.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2012:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2012:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P191_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P191_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P191_S3	The weighted-average fair value of the options was $9.81, $9.29, and $8.18 for options granted during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P191_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P192_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P193_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	Restricted shares for employees vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2012 is as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2012 is $1,933,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P196_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1,265,000 and $380,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s performance over a three year period depending on the Company s total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P197_S2	Performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based on fair value on date of grant, the number of shares ultimately expected to vest and the vesting period.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P197_S3	For accounting purposes, the performance shares are considered to have a market condition.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P197_S4	The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value of the award and, thus compensation expense is recognized on this type of award provided that the requisite service is rendered (regardless of whether the market condition is achieved).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of each performance share granted under the LTIP on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	Expected volatility is based upon the daily historical volatilities of Columbus McKinnon s stock and our peer group.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	The risk free rate was based on zero coupon government bonds at the time of grant.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the three year performance period.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value performance shares granted during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	Total unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested performance share awards as of March 31, 2012 was $1,180,000 and is expected be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P203_S1	The fair value of performance shares that vested during the year ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $0 for all three years.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $16.99, $15.85, and $13.00 for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P206_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $420,000, $450,000, and $280,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.

1005229_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $20,536,000 and $20,576,000 as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 7).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	The per occurrence limits on our self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P212_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P212_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P213_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P213_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P213_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P214_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P214_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P214_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P214_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $7,000,000 and $18,000,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 18 to 30 years from March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $12,000,000, which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $1,500,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P215_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P216_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $8,500,000, which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2010, as part of the business reorganization plan, the Company initiated strategic consolidation of its North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P220_S1	The process included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P220_S2	The closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately 500,000 square feet of manufacturing space.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P220_S3	Restructuring charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 relate to the continuation of the consolidation of the North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P220_S4	Charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 included a write off of production supplies in the amount of $411,000 and other facility related costs of $2,208,000, offset by a gain in the sale of a closed facility in the amount of $419,000.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	Also, in fiscal 2010, the Company consolidated its North American sales force and offered certain of its employees an incentive to voluntarily retire early.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P221_S1	Charges related to the early retirement program were approximately $5,732,000 and consist of two benefits: a paid leave of absence and an enhanced pension benefit.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P221_S2	The payments for the paid leave of absence are being made to the employees in installments on their regular pay dates.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	Charges for the enhanced pension benefit of $2,012,000 are recorded in long-term pension liabilities.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P222_S1	Long-term pension liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company initiated and completed employee workforce reductions at one of its European facilities.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P223_S1	These reductions resulted in approximately $413,000 in one-time termination benefits recorded as restructuring costs during the year ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P223_S2	These restructuring charges were fully paid by March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	During year ended March 31, 2012, the Company recognized a gain of $1,462,000 on the sale of a previously closed manufacturing facility.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P224_S1	The gain was recorded as a credit to restructuring expenses.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of the activity related to restructuring reserves (in thousands):
1005229_12_ITEM8_P226_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P226_S1	The sources and tax effects of the difference were as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P227_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P228_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $42,983,000 (or $2.26 per diluted share) included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P228_S1	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S and three of the Company s subsidiaries is necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P229_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P230_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P230_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P231_S0	The valuation allowance includes $1,358,000 and $1,240,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P231_S1	The increase in foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to net operating losses in two of the Company s subsidiaries.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P231_S2	The Company s valuation allowance related to foreign subsidiaries net operating losses have lives that range from five years to indefinite.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P232_S0	The federal net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2030 to 2031.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P232_S1	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2015 through 2030.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P232_S2	The federal tax credits have expiration dates starting in 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P233_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P234_S0	The net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P234_S1	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P235_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $18,590,000, $12,403,000, and $8,769,000 for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P235_S1	Income from discontinued operations reported in the statements of operations is net of tax expense of $0, $243,000, and $326,000 for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P235_S2	As of March 31, 2012, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $94,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P235_S3	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P235_S4	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P236_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P236_S1	The tax benefits to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as a reduction of income tax expense, were $0 and $68,000 in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P236_S2	This tax shortfall has also been recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as an increase in deferred tax assets.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P237_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P238_S0	The Company had $176,000 and $96,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P238_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P239_S0	Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2012 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P240_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 resulting in no adjustments.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P240_S2	Current examinations include various state audits.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Company s major jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P241_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2011 and in Germany for tax years prior to December 31, 2006.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P242_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations prior to March 31, 2013.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P243_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $6,832,000, $7,195,000, and $5,463,000, respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P243_S1	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2012 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P244_S0	The following information sets forth the condensed consolidating summary financial information of the parent and guarantors, which guarantee the 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes, and the nonguarantors.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P244_S1	The guarantors are wholly owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Company has reclassified certain balances in its March 31, 2011 summary financial information to reflect the liquidation of a subsidiary effective as of that date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P245_S1	The reclassifications have no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P246_S0	As of and for the year ended March 31, 2012:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P247_S0	ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P247_S1	The Company has one operating and reportable segment for both internal and external reporting purposes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P248_S0	Financial information relating to the Company s operations by geographic area is as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P249_S0	Note: Long-lived assets include net property, plant, and equipment and goodwill and other intangibles, net.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P250_S0	Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2012 and 2011:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P251_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $39,700,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P251_S1	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S. was necessary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P252_S0	Note: The per-share net income (loss) for the four quarters combined may not equal the per share net loss for the year due to rounding.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P253_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:
1005229_12_ITEM8_P254_S0	The deferred taxes associated with the items included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, were $438,000 and $952,000 for 2012 and 2011 respectively.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P254_S1	Refer to Note 18 for discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P254_S2	In the period subsequent to our initial recording of the valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, increases and decreases to both the deferred tax assets associated with items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the valuation allowance, have been recorded as offsets to comprehensive income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P255_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $534,000 charge in the minimum pension liability component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P255_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P255_S2	This is in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, even though the valuation allowance was initially established by a charge against comprehensive income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P255_S3	This amount will remain indefinitely as a component of minimum pension liability adjustment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P256_S0	The activity by year related to investments, including reclassification adjustments for activity included in earnings are as follows (all items shown net of tax):
1005229_12_ITEM8_P257_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P257_S1	Among the new provisions in ASU 2011-05 was a requirement for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented (for both interim and annual financial statements); however this reclassification requirement is indefinitely deferred by ASU 2011-12 and will be further deliberated by the FASB at a future date.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P258_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2011-11).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P258_S1	The update requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P258_S2	The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods therein.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P258_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S1	The amendment permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S2	If, after assessing relevant events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to follow the existing provisions of the two-step impairment test.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S4	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S5	We adopted the new guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test, which we tested as of our measurement date of February 29, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P259_S6	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P260_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2011-05 ), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P260_S1	The issuance of ASU 2011-5 is intended to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P260_S2	The guidance in ASU 2011-5 supersedes the presentation options in ASC Topic 220 and facilitates convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P260_S3	The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S0	In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) ( ASU 2011-04 ).
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S1	ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards ) on fair value measurements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S2	The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011-04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S3	The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and IFRS.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S4	The amendments in this ASU are required to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P261_S5	The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P262_S0	In March 2011, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 114.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P262_S1	This SAB revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in the codification of the Staff Accounting Bulletin Series.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P262_S2	This update is intended to make the relevant interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance issued as a part of the FASB s Codification.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P262_S3	The principal changes involve revision or removal of accounting guidance references and other conforming changes to ensure consistency of referencing through the SAB Series.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P262_S4	The effective date for SAB 114 was March 28, 2011.
1005229_12_ITEM8_P263_S0	The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of March 31, 2012, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2012.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 20121 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P4_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria) .
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Columbus McKinnon Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P12_S0	In our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria .
1005229_12_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012, and our report dated May 30, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged attachment, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling our other products.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell our other products through our existing distribution channels in that region.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Pfaff, Shaw-Box and Yale, are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the manufacturing industry capacity utilization, industrial production and the general economic activity indicators, like GDP.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Both the U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for the Company.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	U.S. industrial capacity utilization increased to 77.1% in March 2013, trending up from 76.9% in March 2012 and slightly improved from 77.0% in December 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization was 77.2% in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, down from 79.9% during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, but improved from 76.9% at the end of December 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	The European indicator reflects the modest recession being experienced in the Eurozone, while the U.S. indicator demonstrates moderate economic growth.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P1_S5	In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for countries significant to our operations including China, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	The broad, global material handling industry includes the following sectors:
1005229_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The breadth of our products and services enables us to participate in most of these sectors.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	This diversification, together with our extensive and varied distribution channels, minimizes our dependence on any particular product, market or customer.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	We believe that none of our competitors offers the variety of products or services in the markets we serve.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several macro-economic growth drivers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Productivity Enhancement - We believe employers respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Further, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Safety Regulations - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, employers seek safer ways to lift and position loads.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Consolidation of Suppliers - In an effort to reduce costs and increase productivity, our channel partners and end-user customers are increasingly consolidating their suppliers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe that our broad product offering combined with our well established brand names will enable us to benefit from this consolidation and enhance our market share.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Leading North American Market Positions - We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists, alloy and high strength carbon steel chain and attachments, and actuators in North America.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have developed our leading market positions over our 138-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior service.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Approximately 84% of our U.S. net sales for the year ended March 31, 2013 were from product categories in which we believe we hold the number one market share.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	We believe that the strength of our established products and brands and our leading market positions provide us with significant competitive advantages, including preferred supplier status with a majority of our largest channel partners and end user customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our large installed base of products also provides us with a significant competitive advantage in selling our products to existing customers as well as providing repair and replacement parts.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The following table summarizes the product categories where we believe we are the U.S. market leader:
1005229_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived from survey information collected and provided by our trade associations in 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates based on our market shares of Powered Hoists and Manual Hoists Trolleys, which we believe are good proxies for our Hoist Parts market share because we believe most end-users purchase Hoist Parts from the original equipment supplier.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparison of our net sales to net sales of one of our competitors and to estimates of total market sales from a trade association in 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparing the number of our tire shredders in use and their capacity to estimates of the total number of tires shredded published by a trade association in 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Market share and market position are internal estimates derived from both the number of bids we win as a percentage of the total projects for which we submit bids and from estimates of our competitors net sales based on their relative position in distributor catalogues in 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe we offer the most comprehensive product lines in the markets we serve.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We offer engineering and design services to help channel partners and end users solve material handling problems.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Most of our products are maintenance, repair and operating tools which work in conjunction with each other to create a complete lifting system.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	We complement our product offerings with engineering and design services to assist our channel partners and end-users in finding the optimal solution for their material handling needs.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S4	Our capability as a full-line supplier has allowed us to (i) provide our customers with one-stop shopping for material handling equipment, which meets some customers desires to reduce the number of their supply relationships in order to lower their costs, (ii) leverage our engineering, product development and marketing costs over a larger sales base and (iii) achieve purchasing efficiencies on common materials used across our product lines.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P15_S5	No single SKU comprises more than 1% of our sales, a testament to our broad and diversified product offering.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In addition, our brand names, including Budgit, Chester, CM, Coffing, Duff-Norton, Little Mule, Pfaff, Shaw-Box and Yale, are among the most recognized and respected in the industry.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	The CM and Yale names have been synonymous with powered hoists and manual hoists and were first developed and marketed under these brand names in the early 1900s.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe that our strong brand name recognition has created customer loyalty and helps us maintain existing business, as well as capture additional business.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	We are at the forefront of innovation in our industry and continually introduce new products to meet our changing customer needs.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	Products introduced or engineered for our customers during the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 account for approximately 23.7% of our net sales; exceeding our goal to have these products contributing 20% to revenue.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Distribution Channel Diversity and Strength - Our products are sold to over 15,000 general and specialty distributors, end users and OEMs globally.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We enjoy long-standing relationships with, and are a preferred provider to, the majority of our largest distributors and industrial buying groups.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	There has been consolidation among distributors of material handling equipment and we have benefited from this consolidation by maintaining and enhancing our relationships with our leading distributors, as well as forming new relationships.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	We believe our extensive distribution channels provide a significant competitive advantage and allow us to effectively market new product line extensions and promote cross-selling.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our largest distributor represents approximately 4.0% of our total net sales and our top 10 customers represent approximately 19% of our total net sales.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Expanding Non-U.S. Markets - We have significantly grown our non-U.S. sales since becoming a public company in 1996.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our non-U.S. sales have grown from $34,300,000 (representing 16% of total sales) in fiscal 1996 to $253,252,000 (representing 42% of our total sales) during the year ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	This growth has occurred primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	We have nine offices in China to sell into this growing industrial market.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our non-U.S. business has provided us, and we believe will continue to provide us, with significant growth opportunities and new markets for our products.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	"Non-U.S. sales" as expressed throughout Items 1 and 7 of this Form 10-K, are defined as sales to customers located outside of the United States.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We are extremely focused on optimizing our cost structure and have taken a number of steps towards reducing our costs, including: consolidating facilities, promoting a Lean culture, manufacturing in low cost jurisdictions, coordinating purchasing activities across the organization and selectively outsourcing non-critical functions.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	The actions we have taken to date have eliminated fixed costs from our operations and provided us with significant operating leverage as the economic conditions in our markets continue to improve.

1005229_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	Orders for products that are manufactured to customers specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P83_S4	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	The material handling industry remains highly fragmented.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Demag Cranes and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; for tire shredders is Granutech; and for light-rail systems is Gorbel.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	At March 31, 2013, we had 2,578 employees; 1,524 in the U.S./Canada, 107 in Latin America, 746 in Europe and 201 in Asia.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	Approximately 14% of our employees are represented under four separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2013 and April 2015.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P88_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; and electro-mechanical components.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our Purchasing Council to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our distribution channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S4	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P89_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency exposures.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements and cross-currency swaps to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	In addition, we use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases and sales denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, castings and electro-mechanical components are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P93_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P93_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P94_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, have not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2014.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Coffing Hoist facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $245,000.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	In March of 2007, we also discovered the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our Damascus, Virginia hoist plant and have notified the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (the DEQ ).
1005229_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	We filed an application with the DEQ to participate in its voluntary remediation program and have been accepted.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	The estimated cost for the voluntary clean-up is not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $25,000.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	In June of 2007, we were identified by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( the DEC ), along with other companies, as a potential responsible party ( PRP ) at the Frontier Chemical Royal Avenue Site in Niagara Falls, New York.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	We sent waste sulfuric acid pickling solution generated at our facility in Tonawanda, New York to the Frontier Royal Avenue Site during the period from approximately 1982 to 1984.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	We have joined with other PRP members known as the Frontier Chemical Site Joint Defense Alliance Group to conduct investigation and, if appropriate, remediation activities at the site.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	We settled this matter in June 2012 for approximately $71,000.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	CMCO has been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	CMCO sent its pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and CMCO is required to pay its share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P99_S3	These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which CMCO pays 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P99_S4	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued a total of $356,000 as of March 31, 2013 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	During the last five years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to improve our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions, and, during the global recession in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we experienced substantially reduced demand for our products.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, their construction and capital expenditure budgets, changes in their vertical market sectors and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, for example, we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products, generally as a result of the global economic slowdown.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and incurred restructuring costs in these periods.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	These lower levels of demand resulted in a 20% decline in net sales from our 2008 fiscal year to our 2010 fiscal year, from $593,800,000 to $476,100,000, despite our acquisition of Pfaff in the middle of our 2009 fiscal year.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We have seen improvement in demand for our products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2013 were $597,263,000 up $5,318,000 or 1.0% from the year ending March 31, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	However, there is no certainty that this improvement will continue in the future.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, approximately 42% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in lower cost countries, in particular in China and Hungary.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $253,252,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the euro and the Canadian dollar, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Vice President, EMEA.
1005229_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Amherst, New York and, as of March 31, 2013, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 42 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Based on this review, we do not believe that any of our pending asbestos-related claims will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2013, there were 588 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	We do not currently pay cash dividends.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	We may reconsider or revise this policy from time to time based upon conditions then existing, including, without limitation, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions under credit agreements or other conditions our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	On May 22, 2013, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $19.01 per share.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, the S P MidCap 400 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2008 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	Going forward, we will replace the S P MidCap 400 Index with the S P SmallCap 600 Index as it is a more appropriate comparison for the Company.
1005229_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2013 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Refer to Results of Operations in Item 7.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company s impairment testing is performed on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company recorded a $107,000,000 goodwill impairment charge in accordance with ASC Topic 350-20 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	As a result of the increased operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	As noted in footnote number (3) above, this valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P6_S2	The majority of this charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S is necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P7_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P8_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P8_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S0	In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which was payable over 10 years ending in May 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S2	The full amount of this note had been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S3	Principal payments received on the note had been recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S4	As of March 31, 2013, the note was paid in full.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P9_S5	Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on Discontinued Operations.
1005229_13_ITEM6_P10_S0	Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable and subordinated debt.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes and rigging tools.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by the Company s superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 138-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on improvement of the fundamentals including market expansion, a high degree of customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the course of our history, we have managed through many business cycles and our solid cash flow profile has helped us grow and expand globally.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We stand with a capital structure which includes sufficient cash reserves, significant revolver availability with an expiration of October 31, 2017, fixed-rate long-term debt which expires in 2019 and a solid cash flow business profile.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Additionally, our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 42% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies as well as benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our products.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have improved over the last several years, though we have recently seen a small decline in the Eurozone.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments and actuators.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, general industrial, entertainment, and mining.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduced defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduced warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We purchase approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural and others.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Some of our steel costs have increased during this year as a result of higher scrap and alloy surcharges.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on opportunities for non-U.S. market penetration and product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	While we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our solid capital structure, including our cash position and flexible cost base.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	We are also aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities to enhance future margins.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The fiscal 2013 increase in gross profit of $16,513,000 or 10.5% is the result of $16,057,000 in price increases, $5,355,000 in increased productivity, $3,812,000 in increased volume, $1,666,000 from lower product liability expenses, and $1,971,000 from net acquisition and divestiture activity partially offset by $6,821,000 in material inflation.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on gross profit of $5,527,000.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in fiscal 2013 selling expense was consistent with the overall increase in sales volume.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	Additionally, foreign currency translation had a $2,760,000 favorable impact on selling expenses.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative expenses were $52,271,000 and $46,677,000 or 8.8% and 7.9% of net sales in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in fiscal 2013 general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of investments in emerging markets and new product development costs, higher variable compensation costs, higher employee benefit costs, including pension and group medical costs, the implementation of the Company s new enterprise management system, as well as general inflationary increases.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Restructuring charges of $0 and ($1,037,000), or 0% and (0.2%) of net sales were recorded in fiscal 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of $43,735,000 in volume resulting from the economic recovery and market share gains.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Price increases resulted in a $13,585,000 increase in sales.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	The unused portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility combined with our cash balance yields total liquidity of $211,541,000 at March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	The applicable margin is determined based on the pricing grid in the New Revolving Credit Facility which varies based on the Company s total leverage ratio at March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P44_S5	The New Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all U.S. inventory, receivables, equipment, real property, subsidiary stock (limited to 65% of non-U.S. subsidiaries) and intellectual property.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	In connection with the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility, it was determined that the borrowing capacity of each lender participating in this new agreement exceeded their borrowing capacities prior to the amendment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the agreement prior to its amendment remain deferred and are being amortized over the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Fees and other costs paid to execute the New Revolving Credit Facility totaling $684,000 were recorded as additional deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Unregistered 7 7/8% Notes were used to repurchase or redeem all of the outstanding 8 7/8% Notes amounting to $124,855,000 and to fund working capital and other corporate activities.

1005229_13_ITEM7_P48_S7	The Unregistered 7 7/8% Notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future U.S. subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company exchanged its $150,000,000 outstanding Unregistered 7 7/8% Notes for a like principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( 7 7/8% Notes ).

1005229_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of March 31, 2013, by period of estimated payments due:
1005229_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	As described in Note 12 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	As described in Note 19 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $40 million.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Estimated for our Senior Subordinated Notes due 2/1/19 and other senior debt.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	As described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Excludes uncertain tax positions of $2.0 million shown separately above.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $14,879,000, $13,765,000 and $12,543,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $20,000,000 to $25,000,000, excluding acquisitions and strategic alliances.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	However, U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance, workers compensation insurance, pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program, divestitures, acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	In May 2002, we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of ASI which comprised the principal business unit in our former Solutions - Automotive segment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Proceeds from this sale included an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 payable over 10 years.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Due to the uncertainty of its collection, the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	Accordingly, $0, and $1,052,000 of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal 2013, and 2012 respectively, net of tax.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	The note was paid during the year ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013 the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 13 to our fiscal 2013 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The pension discount rate assumptions of 4.35%, 4.70%, and 5.75%, as of March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The decrease in the discount rate for fiscal 2013 resulted in a $9,300,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2012 resulted in an $11,500,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.5% for each of the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 70% equities and 30% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2013 and 2012 was $62,163,000 and $65,123,000, or 27.1% and 30.3% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were approximately $10,328,000 and $5,974,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S6	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S7	Pension expense for the March 31, 2014 fiscal year is expected to approximate $6,390,000, less than the fiscal 2013 amount of $7,464,000.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S8	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2014 fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately $700,000 compared to fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P72_S9	The compensation increase assumption of 2% as of March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 7.5% 8.0%, and 8.5% for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Healthcare costs in the United States have increased substantially over the last several years.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	If this trend continues, the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our goodwill balance, $105,354,000 as of March 31, 2013 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
1005229_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our Duff-Norton reporting unit and Rest of Products reporting unit have goodwill totaling $9,770,000 and $95,584,000, respectively, at March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which our reporting units operate.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	At March 31, 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,256,000.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance .
1005229_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	In fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of U.S. statutory rates.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 at March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether U.S. federal and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	In fiscal year 2013, we utilized the remaining U.S. federal NOLs thereby, reducing the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	As a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years, we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining NOLs and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Management concluded that it is more likely than not that almost all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized; therefore, $49,161,000 of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The balance of the valuation allowance at March 31, 2012 was $53,325,000.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	This charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S. was necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	The deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans, insurance reserves, U.S. tax credits, and U.S. NOLs.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	The U.S. NOLs have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	During the third quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company determined that it would be in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position in the U.S. at March 31, 2011 primarily due to restructuring-related charges incurred in the U.S., despite our expectations of future profitability.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	If the cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three year period.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	If we were to experience an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed NOL carryforward period.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	The amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built-in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P100_S3	The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	The ASU requires entities to provide information about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	Management does not expect the adoption of this standard has a significant effect on the Company's financial statement disclosures.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, "Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities".
1005229_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The ASU clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and certain other receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	Specifically, Update 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	Management does not expect the adoption of this standard has a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	In October 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements which amends a wide variety of Topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification ).
1005229_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2012-04 represent changes to clarify the Codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-04 in fiscal 2013 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	In August 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-03, Technical Amendments and Corrections to SEC Sections:
1005229_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	No. 33-9250, and Corrections Related to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-22 (SEC Update) .
1005229_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	This update amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SAB No. 114.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-03 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, which updated the guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The amendments in Update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Under these amendments, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S3	The amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S4	The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P109_S5	The amendments are not expected to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2011-05 ), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	The issuance of ASU 2011-5 is intended to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	The guidance in ASU 2011-5 supersedes the presentation options in ASC Topic 220 and facilitates convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-05 in fiscal 2013 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ( ASU 2011-04 ).
1005229_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards ) on fair value measurements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011-04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and IFRS.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P112_S4	The amendments in this ASU are required to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-04 in fiscal 2013 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2013, 42% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, European currencies, the Mexican peso and the Chinese Yuan.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $2,100,000 on our net income.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements and cross-currency swaps in place to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The notional amount of these derivatives is $3,295,000 and all contracts mature by September 30, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These contracts are not designated as hedges.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to hedge changes in the value of recorded foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $2,529,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases and sales, including multi-year contracts related to capital project sales, denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $8,071,000 and all contracts mature within fifteen months of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	At March 31, 2013, we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	At March 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 100% and 99% of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	At those dates, we had approximately $0 and $112,000, respectively, of outstanding variable rate debt.
1005229_13_ITEM7A_P7_S4	A 1% fluctuation in interest rates would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by $0 in fiscal 2013 and less than $10,000 in fiscal 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2013 and 2012 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 29, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	The zero net deferred tax benefit related to the change in derivatives for our domestic subsidiaries qualifying as hedges, unrealized holding gains and losses, and reclassification adjustments during the years ended 2012 and 2011 is due to the related deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) is a leading designer, marketer and manufacturer of material handling products and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, and actuators.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company s material handling products are sold globally principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P6_S3	During fiscal 2013, approximately 58% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Advertising expenses were $2,900,000, $3,500,000, and $3,700,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	Approximately 14% of the Company s employees are represented by four separate U.S. and Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2013 and April 2015 with approximately 7% represented by collective bargaining agreements which expire within 12 months.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our Mexican subsidiary closes one month early to facilitate consolidated reporting.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The carrying value of the Company s current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair values based upon the relatively short maturity of those instruments.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the year.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	There were (gains)/losses, including changes in the fair value of derivatives, on foreign currency transactions of approximately $(45,000), $316,000, and $452,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2013 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	See Note 9 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 3 to 18 years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Cost of approximately 48% and 44% of inventories at March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, respectively, have been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Research and development costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $5,172,000, $4,497,000, and $2,947,000 for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P35_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to conform with current year reporting presentation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	On December 13, 2011, the Company acquired 80% of the outstanding common shares of Yale Lifting Solutions (Pty) LTD ( YLS PTY ) located in Magaliesburg, South Africa, a privately owned company with annual sales of less than $10,000,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company now owns 100% of YLS PTY.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	YLS PTY has been representing the Company s Yale brand of products as a distributor to the South African mining industry for over 14 years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company had previously owned 20% of the outstanding common shares of YLS PTY which the Company accounted for as a cost method investment as it did not exercise significant influence over YLS PTY s operating or financial policies.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	The carrying amount of the cost method investment prior to the acquisition of the remaining 80% interest was under $1,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	The results of YLS PTY are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The acquisition of YLS PTY is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805 Business Combinations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The aggregate purchase consideration for the remaining 80% ownership of Yale Lifting Solutions (Pty) LTD was $3,356,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	The acquisition date fair value of the Company s 20% interest in YLS PTY was $850,000 and resulted in an $850,000 gain, which is recorded within other income, net in the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	The acquisition was funded with existing cash.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P48_S4	The purchase price and fair value of the previously held 20% ownership interest has been assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The identifiable intangible assets consist of customer contracts with a value of $397,000 (3 year estimated useful life).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The excess consideration over fair value was recorded as goodwill and approximates $1,470,000, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Income from discontinued operations presented herein includes payments received on a note receivable related to the fiscal 2002 disposal of Automatic Systems, Inc.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial viability of the debtor, the note was recorded at the estimated net realizable value of $0 at the time of the divestiture.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	The note had a remaining balance of $214,000 at March 31, 2012, which the Company collected during fiscal year 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Summarized statements of operations for discontinued operations are as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements for year ended March 31, 2013 and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	When valuing our derivative portfolio, the Company uses readily observable market data in conjunction with commonly used valuation models.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Consequently, the Company designates our derivatives as Level 2.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities are the same as their fair value with the exception of the subordinated debt whose carrying value is a liability of $148,412,000 and $148,140,000 at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive loss, to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	During fiscal 2009, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain marketable securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P69_S3	During fiscal 2013, 2011, and 2010, the Company sold a portion of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of gains of approximately $242,000, $1,852,000, and $606,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2012 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of YLS PTY described in Note 3.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.

1005229_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.

1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S5	The Company has four reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S6	Only two of the four reporting units carry goodwill at March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P91_S7	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,770,000 and $9,821,000 at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings design, manufacturing, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $95,584,000 and $96,614,000 at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S3	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S4	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P94_S5	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	Goodwill is recognized net of accumulated impairment losses of $107,000,000 as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1005229_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company has an investment objective for domestic pension plans to adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed to support all current and future benefit payment obligations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	The investment strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which are expected to satisfy the aforementioned objective and produce both absolute and risk adjusted returns competitive with a benchmark that is a blend of major U.S. and international equity indexes and an aggregate bond fund.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P144_S2	The shift to the targeted allocation is the result of management s re-evaluation of its investment allocation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P144_S3	The targeted allocation will be accomplished as some plan assets governed by collective bargaining contracts will be transferred from fixed income into equity securities, as well as reallocation of remaining assets to achieve the desired balance during fiscal 2014.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company s funding policy with respect to the defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

1005229_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	The Company s investment policy as it relates to its pension assets is to invest in broad-based mutual funds, with an investment objective of being diversified.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P157_S2	Further the Company s investment objective of its equity securities is long-term growth, its objective of the fixed income securities is long-term growth, consistency of income and preservation of capital, and its objective of cash equivalents is preservation of capital.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P157_S3	It is the Company s position that its investment policy and investment objectives as defined above reduce the risk of concentrations within its investments.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	The fair values of the Company s defined benefit plans consolidated assets by asset category as of March 31 were as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	The fair values of our defined benefit plans consolidated assets were determined using the fair value hierarchy of inputs described in Note 5.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	The fair values by category of inputs as of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012 were as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	Level 1 fixed income securities consist of fixed income mutual funds with quoted market prices.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Level 2 securities are investments in common collective trust funds.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	The fair values of these securities are determined based on the net asset value of these funds.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P161_S2	Each of these investment funds has a stated performance objective to approximate as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the stated benchmark to which the funds are indexed, over the long term.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P161_S3	Redemptions of the units held in these funds may be made on the last business day of each month and on at least one other business day during the month, based on the net asset value per unit of the funds.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P161_S4	We are not aware of any significant restrictions on the issuances or redemptions of units of participation in these funds.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	Fair value of Level 3 fixed income securities at the beginning of the year was $16,481,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	During fiscal 2013 fixed income securities earned investment return of $742,000 and had disbursements of $416,000 resulting in an ending balance of $16,807,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	These fixed income securities consist primarily of insurance contracts which are carried at their liquidation value based on actuarial calculations and the terms of the contracts.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	Significant inputs in determining the fair value for these contracts include company contributions, contract disbursements and stated interest rates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P163_S2	Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost and recorded as part of cost of sales, selling, or general and administrative expense.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	The guidance in ASC Topic 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and covered in sub-topic 718-40 "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released to employees, rather than based on their original cost.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	Also, dividends on those ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P164_S2	Rather, since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation expense is recorded.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P164_S3	Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares of the Company s common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P165_S1	An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a deduction from shareholders equity.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	Effective January 1, 2012 the ESOP was closed to new hires.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P166_S1	Prior to this date, substantially all of the Company s U.S. non-union employees were participants in the ESOP.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	Contributions to the plan result from the release of collateralized shares as debt service payments are made.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P167_S1	Compensation expense amounting to $422,000, $416,000, and $466,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is recorded based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at their fair market value.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P167_S2	Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt service.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	At March 31, 2013 and 2012, 481,000 and 494,000 of ESOP shares, respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants accounts.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	At March 31, 2013 and 2012, 35,000 and 61,000 of ESOP shares were pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	The fair market value of unearned ESOP shares amounted to $669,000 and $991,000 at March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, respectively as determined based on the quoted market value of the Company s stock.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P170_S1	Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P170_S2	Diluted earnings per share include any dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted stock.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P170_S3	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 189,000, 184,000, and 249,000 common shares were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, because they were antidilutive.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (share data presented in thousands):
1005229_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	The weighted-average common stock outstanding shown above is net of unallocated ESOP shares (see Note 14).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, applying the modified prospective method.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P173_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P173_S2	Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	Prior to the adoptions of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company maintained several different stock plans, specifically: 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, collectively referred to as the Prior Stock Plans .
1005229_13_ITEM8_P174_S1	The specifics of each of these plans are discussed below.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	Stock based compensation expense was $3,334,000, $2,913,000, and $2,484,000 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P175_S1	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expenses.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P175_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all share based awards over the service period, which is the shorter of the period until the employees retirement eligibility dates or the service period for the award for awards expected to vest.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P175_S3	Accordingly, expense is generally reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P175_S4	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	On July 26, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the LTIP.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 1,250,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the Prior Stock Plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Stock Plans.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P177_S3	As of March 31, 2013, 853,000 shares remain for future grants.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	Under the plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of the Plan.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (Non-Qualified Plan) and an Incentive Stock Option Plan (Incentive Plan).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P180_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2013 is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2013 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 557,000 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2013 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 288,000 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $19.25 as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $332,000, $1,466,000, and $40,000 during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P183_S5	As of March 31, 2013, there are no options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	The fair value of shares that vested was $9.21, $8.96, and $9.33 during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2013 and 2012 was approximately $295,000 and $1,436,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	As of March 31, 2013, $1,777,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	Exercise prices for options outstanding as of March 31, 2013, ranged from $5.46 to $28.45.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P188_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2013:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2013:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P191_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P191_S3	The weighted-average fair value of the options was $6.70, $9.81, and $9.29 for options granted during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P191_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P192_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P193_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	Restricted shares for employees vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2013 is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2013 is $1,834,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1,025,000 and $1,265,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P197_S1	Fiscal year 2013 Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the one year period ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P197_S2	Fiscal year 2013 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon the award earned and the fair market value as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P197_S3	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	Fiscal Year 2012 and 2011 performance shares granted were based upon the Company s performance over a three year period depending on the Company s total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P198_S1	Fiscal year 2012 and 2011 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based on fair value on date of grant, the number of shares ultimately expected to vest and the vesting period.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P198_S2	For accounting purposes, the 2012 and 2011 performance shares are considered to have a market condition.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P198_S3	The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value of the award and, thus compensation expense is recognized on this type of award provided that the requisite service is rendered (regardless of whether the market condition is achieved).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of each 2012 and 2011 performance share granted under the LTIP on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	Expected volatility is based upon the daily historical volatilities of Columbus McKinnon s stock and our peer group.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	The risk free rate was based on zero coupon government bonds at the time of grant.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P201_S0	The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the three year performance period.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value performance shares granted during fiscal 2012 and 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P203_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2013 is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P204_S0	Total unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested performance share awards as of March 31, 2013 was $962,000 and is expected be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P204_S1	The fair value of performance shares that vested during the year ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 was $0 for all three years.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P205_S0	The Company maintained a Restricted Stock Plan.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P205_S1	The Company charges compensation expense and shareholders equity for the market value of shares ratably over the restricted period.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P205_S2	Grantees that remain continuously employed with the Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P205_S3	As of March 31, 2013, there were no shares available for future grants under the Restricted Stock Plan and no further outstanding grants.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P206_S0	No restricted stock was granted in fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P206_S1	During fiscal year 2013, 1,000 shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of $30.72 vested.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, a total of 25,552, 21,248, and 17,664 shares of stock, respectively, were granted under the LTIP to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P207_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $14.09, $16.94, and $15.85 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P207_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $361,000, $360,000, and $280,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P208_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P208_S1	Subject to limited exceptions, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company s common shares or announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common shares.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P208_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P209_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P209_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P210_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $17,119,000 and $20,536,000 as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 7).
1005229_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P213_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P213_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P214_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P214_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P214_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P214_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2014.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P215_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P215_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P215_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P215_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $8,000,000 and $13,000,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 18 to 30 years from March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $10,967,000, which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,300,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P216_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P217_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $6,152,000, which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2010, as part of the business reorganization plan, the Company initiated strategic consolidation of its North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P221_S1	The process included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P221_S2	The closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately 500,000 square feet of manufacturing space.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P221_S3	Restructuring charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 relate to the continuation of the consolidation of the North American hoist and rigging operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P221_S4	Charges recorded in the year ended March 31, 2011 included a write off of production supplies in the amount of $411,000 and other facility related costs of $2,208,000, offset by a gain in the sale of a closed facility in the amount of $419,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company initiated and completed employee workforce reductions at one of its European facilities.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P222_S1	These reductions resulted in approximately $413,000 in one-time termination benefits recorded as restructuring costs during the year ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P222_S2	These restructuring charges were fully paid by March 31, 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	During year ended March 31, 2012, the Company recognized a gain of $1,462,000 on the sale of a previously closed manufacturing facility.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P223_S1	The gain was recorded as a credit to restructuring expenses.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P224_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of the activity related to restructuring reserves (in thousands):
1005229_13_ITEM8_P225_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P225_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P226_S0	The provision for income tax (benefit) expense consisted of the following:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P227_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P228_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $51,347,000 and $58,226,000 at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P229_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P230_S0	As a result of the improved operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P230_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credits carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P231_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P231_S1	As described above, this charge was nearly fully reversed during the year ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P231_S2	This charge related to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S and three of the Company s subsidiaries was necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P232_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P233_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P233_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P234_S0	The valuation allowance includes $1,660,000, $1,358,000 and $1,240,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P234_S1	The increase in foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to net operating losses in two of the Company s subsidiaries.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P234_S2	The Company s valuation allowance related to foreign subsidiaries net operating losses have lives that range from five years to indefinite.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P235_S0	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2031.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P235_S1	The federal tax credits have expiration dates starting in 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P236_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P237_S0	The net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P237_S1	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P238_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $18,322,000, $18,590,000, and $12,403,000 for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P238_S1	Income from discontinued operations reported in the statements of operations is net of tax expense of $0, $0 and $243,000 for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P238_S2	As of March 31, 2013, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $112,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P238_S3	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P238_S4	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P239_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P239_S1	The tax effects to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as a reduction of income tax expense, were $(576,000) and $0 in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P239_S2	This tax shortfall has also been recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a decrease in deferred tax assets.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P240_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Company had $142,000 and $176,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P241_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P242_S0	Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2013 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P243_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 resulting in no adjustments.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P243_S2	Current examinations include various state audits.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P244_S0	The Company s major tax jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P244_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2011 and in Germany for tax years prior to December 31, 2007.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitation prior to March 31, 2014.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P246_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $5,811,000, $6,832,000, and $7,195,000, respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P246_S1	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2013 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following information sets forth the condensed consolidating summary financial information of the parent and guarantors, which guarantee the 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes, and the nonguarantors.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P247_S1	The guarantors are 100% owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P248_S0	As of and for the year ended March 31, 2013:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P249_S0	ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company has one operating and reportable segment for both internal and external reporting purposes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P250_S0	Financial information relating to the Company s operations by geographic area is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P251_S0	Note: Long-lived assets include net property, plant, and equipment and goodwill and other intangibles, net.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P252_S0	Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2013 and 2012:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P253_S0	(1) During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, the Company reversed its deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the United States of $49,161,000, which is included in its provision for income taxes.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P254_S0	Note: The per-share net income for the four quarters combined may not equal the per share net income for the year due to rounding.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P255_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:
1005229_13_ITEM8_P256_S0	The deferred taxes associated with the items included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, were $(216,000), $438,000, and $952,000 for 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P256_S1	Refer to Note 18 for discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P256_S2	In the period subsequent to our initial recording of the valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, increases and decreases to both the deferred tax assets associated with items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the valuation allowance, have been recorded as offsets to comprehensive income.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P257_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $10,006,000 charge in the minimum pension liability component, $(935,000) charge in the other post retirement obligations component, and $747,000 charge in the split dollar life insurance arrangement component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_13_ITEM8_P257_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2013, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.

1005229_13_ITEM8_P266_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-04 in fiscal 2013 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

1005229_13_ITEM8_P270_S2	The guidance in ASU 2011-5 supersedes the presentation options in ASC Topic 220 and facilitates convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.

1005229_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P4_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria) .
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Columbus McKinnon Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_13_ITEM9A_P12_S0	In our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria .

1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling our other products.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell our other products through our existing distribution channels in that region.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Pfaff, Shaw-Box and Yale, are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the manufacturing industry capacity utilization, industrial production and the general economic activity indicators, like GDP.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Both the U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for the Company.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	U.S. industrial capacity utilization increased to 77.6% in March 2014, trending up slightly from 76.8% in March 2013 and 77.1% in December 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization was 80.1% in the quarter ended March 31, 2014, an increase from 77.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2013, as well as improved from 78.4% at the end of December 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The European indicator reflects the start of the recovery from the 2013 recession in Europe, while the U.S. indicator demonstrates stability in the U.S industrial sector.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for countries significant to our operations including China, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We participate predominantly in the hoist, crane, and monorail sector.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several growth drivers.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Productivity Enhancement - We believe employers respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	Further, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Safety Regulations - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, employers seek safer ways to lift and position loads.

1005229_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, we sell overhead bridge, jib and gantry cranes as well as certain Pfaff products directly to end-users.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	The following describes our global distribution channels:
1005229_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	General Distribution Channels - Our global general distribution channels consist of:
1005229_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Industrial distributors that serve local or regional industrial markets and sell a variety of products for maintenance repair, operating and production, or MROP, applications through their own direct sales force.

1005229_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Crane End-Users - We market and sell overhead bridge, jib and gantry cranes, parts and service to end-users through our wholly owned crane builder, Crane Equipment Service, Inc. ( CES ).
1005229_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	CES which includes Abell-Howe and Washington Equipment brands designs, manufactures, installs and services a variety of cranes with capacities up to 100 tons.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Service-After-Sale Distribution Channel - Service-after-sale distributors include our authorized network of 16 chain repair service stations and over 200 certified hoist service and repair stations throughout North America.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	This service network is designed for easy parts and service access for our large installed base of hoists and related equipment in that region.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	OEMs that supply various component parts directly to other industrial manufacturers as well as private branding and packaging of our traditional products for material handling, lifting, positioning and special purpose applications.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that purchase primarily load securing chain and forged attachments.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	We also provide our products to the U.S government for a variety of military applications.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	We maintain customer service departments staffed by trained personnel for all of our sales divisions, and regularly schedule product and service training schools for all customer service representatives and field sales personnel.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	Training programs for distribution and service station personnel, as well as for end-users, are scheduled on a regular basis at most of our facilities and in the field.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	We have over 200 service and repair stations worldwide that provide local and regional repair, warranty and general service work for distributors and end-users.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P82_S3	End-user trainees attending our various programs include representatives of 3M, DuPont, General Electric, and many other industrial and entertainment organizations.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We also provide, in multiple languages, a variety of collateral material in video, CD-ROM, slide and print format addressing relevant material handling topics such as the care, use and inspection of chains and hoists, and overhead lifting and positioning safety.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	In addition, we sponsor advisory boards made up of representatives of our primary distributors and service-after-sale network members who are invited to participate in discussions focused on improving products and service.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	These boards enable us and our primary distributors to exchange product and market information relevant to industry trends.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2014 was approximately $86,801,000 compared to approximately $99,034,000 at March 31, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The decrease in backlog at March 31, 2014 is primarily due to the timing of orders and shortened lead times.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	Orders for products that are manufactured to customers specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P84_S4	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	The material handling industry remains highly fragmented.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes) and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Terex (Demag Cranes) and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; and for tire shredders is Granutech.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	At March 31, 2014, we had 2,626 employees; 1,466 in the U.S./Canada, 115 in Latin America, 834 in Europe and 211 in Asia.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	Approximately 13% of our employees are represented under four separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between September 2014 and May 2017.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P89_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; and electro-mechanical components.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S4	We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P90_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency exposures.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, castings and electro-mechanical components are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, overhead light rail workstations, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P94_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P94_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P95_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P96_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $245,000.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	We sent its pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S3	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay its share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S4	These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P97_S5	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2014 a total of $352,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	During the last five years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to maintain our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries, such as manufacturing, power generation and distribution, commercial construction, oil and gas exploration and refining, transportation, agriculture, logging, and mining that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, approximately 43% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing components in lower cost countries, in particular in China and Hungary.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing business.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $251,902,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2014) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the euro, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at their locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Vice President, EMEA.
1005229_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Amherst, New York and, as of March 31, 2014, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 45 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	Based on this review, we do not believe that any of our pending asbestos-related claims will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2014, there were 583 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The Company's Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing an annual dividend rate of $0.16 per share.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The dividend was paid on May 19, 2014 to shareholders of record on May 9, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our curren t credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	On May 27, 2014, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $29.94 per share.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2009 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2014 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Refer to Results of Operations in Item 7.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	As a result of the increased operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	(3) During 2011, the Company recorded non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	As noted in footnote number (3) above, this valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P5_S2	The majority of this charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S was necessary.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P7_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P7_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P8_S0	(4) In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P8_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which was payable over 10 years ending in May 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P8_S2	The full amount of this note had been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P8_S3	Principal payments received on the note had been recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P8_S4	As of March 31, 2013, the note was paid in full.
1005229_14_ITEM6_P9_S0	(5) Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable and subordinated debt.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations, except in the section entitled Discontinued Operations.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes and rigging tools.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by the Company s superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 139-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on market expansion, customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the course of our history, we have managed through many business cycles and our solid cash flow profile has helped us grow and expand globally.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We stand with a capital structure which includes sufficient cash reserves, significant revolver availability with an expiration of October 31, 2017, fixed-rate long-term debt which expires in 2019 and a solid cash flow business profile.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 43% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies as well as benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our products.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have generally improved over the last several years.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, load chain, forged fittings and actuators.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, general industrial, entertainment, and mining.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S7	We have specific initiatives related to improved workplace safety, customer satisfaction, reduced defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduced warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S8	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P4_S9	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We purchase approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural and others.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering and opportunities for non-U.S. market penetration.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	While we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our solid capital structure, including our cash position and flexible cost base.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	We are also aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities to enhance future margins.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Fiscal 2014 sales were $583,290,000 , down 2.3% , or $13,973,000 compared with fiscal 2013 sales of $597,263,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Sales for the year were positively impacted by $10,218,000 by price increases, $4,983,000 by additional shipping days, and $470,000 due to net acquisition activity.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Sales for the year were negatively impacted $30,203,000 due to a decrease in sales volume.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	The decline in sales volume was due to weakness in our European business resulting from the impact of the recession and declines in our crane business servicing the heavy OEM vertical market.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Favorable foreign currency translation impacted sales by $558,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our gross profit was $181,048,000 and $174,231,000 or 31.0% and 29.2% of net sales in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The fiscal 2014 increase in gross profit of $6,817,000 or 3.9% is the result of $10,218,000 in price increases, $3,198,000 in increased productivity, and $2,554,000 due to net acquisition and divestiture activity, partially offset by $6,561,000 in decreased volume, $1,536,000 in material inflation, and $1,067,000 in increased product liability costs.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Foreign currency translation had an favorable impact on gross profit of $11,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Selling expenses were $68,963,000 and $65,608,000 or 11.8% and 11.0% of net sales in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The incremental increase in selling expenses relates to our recent acquisitions of Hebetechnik and Unified resulting in $1,464,000 of additional selling expenses as well as additional investments to grow our business in Europe and Latin America.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Additionally, foreign currency translation had a $378,000 favorable impact on selling expenses.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	General and administrative expenses were $55,754,000 and $52,271,000 or 9.6% and 8.8% of net sales in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in fiscal 2014 general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of $1,657,000 of atypical professional services associated with a large acquisition that was not consummated.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Additional increases were primarily the result of investments in emerging markets, the implementation of the Company s new enterprise management system, as well as general inflationary increases.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $439,000 unfavorable impact on general and administrative expenses.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Amortization of intangibles was $1,981,000 and $1,981,000 fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively and primarily relate to amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our fiscal 2009 acquisition of Pfaff.

1005229_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance, workers compensation insurance, pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program, divestitures, acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013 the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 13 to our fiscal 2014 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The weighted average pension discount rate assumptions of 4.60%, 4.35%, and 4.70%, as of March 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase in the discount rate for fiscal 2014 resulted in a $9,200,000 decrease in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2013 resulted in an $9,300,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.5% for each of the years ended March 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 65% equities and 35% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $37,457,000 and $62,163,000, or 16.6% and 27.1% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were approximately $11,041,000 and $10,328,000, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S6	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S7	Pension expense for the March 31, 2015 fiscal year is expected to approximate $2,973,000, less than the fiscal 2014 amount of $5,838,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S8	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2015 fiscal year is expected to remain the same as compared to fiscal 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P64_S9	The compensation increase assumption of 2% as of March 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 7.0% 7.5%, and 8.0% for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	While the healthcare inflation rate assumptions have been decreasing, healthcare costs continue to outpace inflation in the U.S.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our goodwill balance of $119,303,000 as of March 31, 2014 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
1005229_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have five reporting units, only three of which have goodwill.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Our Unified Industries, Duff-Norton, and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $6,980,000, $9,865,000, and $102,458,000, respectively, at March 31, 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2014 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units other than Duff-Norton was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units other than the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which the reporting unit operates.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Testing goodwill for impairment under the two-step method requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	The key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 5%.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 4.5% after five years.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	These rates reflect our estimate of long-term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long-term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis as well as our normal annual price increases.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S6	Operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms in fiscal 2015 and 2016.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S7	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 12.8% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S8	We also consider any additional risk of the Duff-Norton reporting unit achieving its forecast, and adjust the weighted-average cost of capital applied when determining the reporting unit s estimated fair value.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S9	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S10	For example, a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $1,128,000 and an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $3,296,000 for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P76_S11	Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of February 28, 2014, necessitating no Step 2 calculations.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, we completed two business combinations for a total purchase price of $22,354,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	We identified and assigned value to engineered drawings, customer relationships, trademarks and names, backlog, and non-compete contracts.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a value of $8,659,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts an d credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	At March 31, 2014 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,323,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	In fiscal years 2013 and 2012 income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of U.S. statutory rates.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 at March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether U.S. federal and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	In fiscal year 2013, we utilized the remaining U.S. federal NOLs thereby, reducing the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	As a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years, we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining NOLs and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Management concluded that it is more likely than not that almost all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized; therefore, $49,161,000 of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance was reversed as of March 31, 2013 .
1005229_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	ASU 2013-11 requires entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	The objective of ASU 2013-07 is to clarify when an entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The update provides principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and requirements for financial statements prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, absent any indications that liquidation is imminent.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, absent any sales or liquidations of a foreign subsidiary.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	In February 2013, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	The ASU requires entities to provide information about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	The Company adopted this ASU in fiscal 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	Refer to Footnote 23 for further details.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, "Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities".
1005229_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The ASU clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and certain other receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	Specifically, Update 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P95_S3	The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2014, 43% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, European currencies, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, and the Chinese yuan.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $1,400,000 on our income from operations.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to hedge changes in the value of recorded foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $3,659,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $3,402,000 and all contracts mature within fourteen months of March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by evaluating the need to enter into financial instrument transactions as appropriate.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	At March 31, 2014, we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place.
1005229_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	At March 31, 2014 and 2013, all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2014 :
1005229_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2014 and 2013 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated May 29, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	The zero net deferred tax benefit related to the change in derivatives for our domestic subsidiaries qualifying as hedges, unrealized holding gains and losses, and reclassification adjustments during the year ended 2012 is due to the related deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	In the U.S., approximately 13% of the Company s employees are represented by five separate collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between September 2014 and May 2017 with approximately 3% represented by collective bargaining agreements which expire within 12 months .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the year.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company s one segment is subdivided into five reporting units.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	To perform the two-step impairment test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	In estimating the terminal growth rate, the Company considers its historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which its reporting units operate.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect the Company s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2014 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units other than Duff-Norton was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units other than the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	Based on the results of the impairment test, the Company determined that the Duff-Norton reporting unit's fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	See Note 9 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 2 to 25 years.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Cost of approximately 40% and 44% of inventories at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively, have been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Included within Other assets is a building that is held for sale in the amount of $854,000 at March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The building was closed as part of the Company's fiscal 2010 restructuring activities.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Research and development costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $5,470,000 , $5,172,000 , and $4,497,000 for the years ended March 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P38_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	All leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any option periods included in the determination of the lease term.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year and for certain products a lifetime warranty.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	On June 1, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Hebetechnik Gesellschaft m.b.H ( Hebetechnik ) located in Austria, a privately owned company with annual sales of approximately $10,000,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	Hebetechnik has been a value-added partner of the Company in the lifting industry in the Austrian market for over 20 years.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	The results of Hebetechnik are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The acquisition of Hebetechnik is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	The acquisition of Hebetechnik was funded with existing cash.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	The excess consideration of $5,324,000 was recorded as goodwill.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S4	The identifiable intangible asset consists of order backlog at the date of the acquisition and is estimated to have a three month useful life.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S5	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition will be deductible for Austrian tax purposes.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P50_S6	The preliminary assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	On February 28, 2014 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Unified Industries, Inc. ( Unified ) located in Howell, Michigan, a privately-owned company with annual sales of approximately $13,000,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	Unified designs, manufacturers and markets overhead aluminum light rail workstations primarily used in automotive and other industrial applications.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	Unified's products are a natural extension of the Company's hoist portfolio and are expected to broaden the scope of the Company's bundled product solutions.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	The results of Unified are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	The acquisition of Unified is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The acquisition of Unified was funded with existing cash.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	The excess consideration of $6,980,000 was recorded as goodwill.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include engineered drawings of $4,960,000 , customer relationships of $2,300,000 , trademark and trade names of $1,200,000 , backlog of $185,000 , and non-compete agreements of $14,000 .

1005229_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The preliminary assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	For both Unified and Hebetechnik, goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that do not meet the criteria for separate recognition apart from goodwill, including assembled workforce, growth opportunities and increased presence in the markets served by the target companies.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	See Note 5 for assumptions used in the valuing of the intangible assets acquired.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013 , the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements for year ended March 31, 2013 and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The fair market value of unearned ESOP shares is determined based on the quoted market value of the Company s stock and consequently, the fair value is based on Level 1 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company primarily uses readily observable market data in conjunction with internally developed discounted cash flow valuation models when valuing its derivative portfolio and, consequently, the fair value of the Company s derivatives is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Company uses quoted prices in an inactive market when valuing its Subordinated Debt, represented by the 7 7/8% Notes due 2019, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (unregistered 7 7/8% Notes) and, consequently, the fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	The carrying value of the Company s senior debt approximates fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, its fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities are the same as their fair value with the exception of the subordinated debt whose carrying value is a liability of $148,685,000 and $148,412,000 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive loss, to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	During fiscal 2009, the Company reduced the cost bases of certain marketable securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 , classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	During fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company sold a portion of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of gains of approximately $350,000 , $242,000 , and $1,852,000 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2014 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Hebetechnik and Unified described in Note 3.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S3	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S4	For Unified, significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 8% for customer relationships, an engineering cost per hour of $57.20 for the engineered drawings, and a royalty rate of 1.5% for trademark and trade names.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P75_S5	For Hebetechnik, significant valuation inputs included a weighted average cost of capital of 12.3% .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Additional assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2014 include the net assets of the Company s Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	This measurement has been used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company applied the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of February 28, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	The fair value for the Company s Duff-Norton reporting unit cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Duff-Norton reporting unit, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Duff Norton reporting unit, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P78_S2	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 5% .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P78_S3	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 4.5% after five years.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P78_S4	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 12.8% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	See Note 9 for additional discussion on the Company's goodwill impairment assessment and the conclusions reached.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	There were LIFO liquidations resulting in $830,000 , $1,482,000 and $2,173,000 of additional income in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 income, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments, our intent and ability to hold the investments until their market values recover, and other market conditions in making this assessment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P85_S3	Based on this assessment, no other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded during fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost basis of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P86_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P86_S3	Since fiscal 2009, the Company has sold nearly all of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of gains of approximately $350,000 , $242,000 , and $1,852,000 in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2014 :
1005229_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2014 are as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company considered the nature of the investments, causes of previous impairments, the severity and duration of unrealized losses and other factors and determined that the unrealized losses at March 31, 2014 were temporary in nature.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Net realized gains related to sales of marketable securities are included in investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations and were $854,000 , $764,000 , and $152,000 , in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	In addition to the above, during the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company sold certain equity securities previously recorded on the consolidated statement of operations in prepaid expenses and other resulting in a gain of $1,354,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P91_S1	This gain has been recorded within other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2013 :

1005229_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Net unrealized gains included in the balance sheet amounted to $1,863,000 at March 31, 2014 and $2,316,000 at March 31, 2013 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	The amounts, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $95,000 and $253,000 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	In addition to the above, the Company has included unrealized gains of $745,000 as of the period ending March 31, 2013 , net of deferred tax liabilities, within accumulated other comprehensive loss related to an investment recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Consolidated property, plant, and equipment of the Company consisted of the following:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	Buildings include assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $4,779,000 and $4,730,000 for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 .

1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the operating segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S5	The Company has five reporting units as of March 31, 2014 and four reporting units as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S6	Only three of the five reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2014 and only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2013 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S7	The Unified Industries reporting unit (which designs, manufacturers and markets overhead light rail workstations) was acquired in fiscal 2014 and had goodwill of $6,980,000 at March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P100_S8	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,865,000 and $9,770,000 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings design, manufacturing, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $102,458,000 and $95,584,000 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2014 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units other than Duff-Norton was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units other than the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach and market approach.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P105_S1	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P105_S2	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P105_S3	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	Based on the results of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Duff-Norton reporting unit's fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	Goodwill is recognized net of accumulated impairment losses of $107,000,000 as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , or 2012 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	Intangible assets at March 31, 2014 are as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	Intangible assets at March 31, 2013 were as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company s intangible assets that are considered to have finite lives are amortized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S1	The weighted-average amortization periods are 18 years for trademarks, 11 years for customer relationships, 25 years for acquired technology, 12 years for other, and 14 years in total.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S2	Trademarks with a book value of $1,200,000 have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not being amortized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S3	Total amortization expense was $1,981,000 , $1,981,000 , and $2,074,000 for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S4	Based on the current amount of intangible assets, the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding five years is expected to be approximately $2,400,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P113_S5	The increase in the annual amortization expense for the succeeding five years as compared to the previous three years relates to the acquisition of Unified in fiscal year 2014.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P114_S3	For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss), or AOCL , and is reclassified to earnings when the underlying transaction has an impact on earnings.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P114_S4	The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in foreign currency exchange loss (gain) in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations and retained earnings.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P114_S5	For derivatives not classified as cash flow hedges, all changes in market value are recorded as a foreign currency exchange loss (gain) in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P187_S4	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	On July 26, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the LTIP.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P189_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 1,250,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the Prior Stock Plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Stock Plans.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P189_S3	As of March 31, 2014 , 632,067 shares remain for future grants.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	Under the plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P191_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of the Plan.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (Non-Qualified Plan) and an Incentive Stock Option Plan (Incentive Plan).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four -year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P193_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2014 is as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2014 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 596,462 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2014 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 258,565 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $26.79 as of March 31, 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $3,251,000 , $332,000 , and $1,466,000 during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P195_S5	As of March 31, 2014 , there are no options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	The grant date fair value of options that vested was $8.11 , $9.21 , and $8.96 during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2014 and 2013 was approximately $2,194,000 and $295,000 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	As of March 31, 2014 , $2,064,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2014 :
1005229_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2014 :
1005229_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options was $8.98 , $6.70 , and $9.81 for options granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P203_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1005229_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	Restricted shares for employees vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2014 is as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2014 is $2,171,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1,571,000 and $1,025,000 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P209_S1	Fiscal year 2014 and 2013 Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the one year period ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P209_S2	Fiscal year 2014 and 2013 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon the award earned and the fair market value as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P209_S3	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2014 is as follows:

1005229_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company charges compensation expense and shareholders equity for the market value of shares ratably over the restricted period.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P212_S2	Grantees that remain continuously employed with the Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P212_S3	As of March 31, 2014 , there were no shares available for future grants under the Restricted Stock Plan and no further outstanding grants.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	No restricted stock was granted in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , or 2012 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P213_S1	During fiscal year 2013, 1,000 shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of $30.72 vested.

1005229_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $24.92 , $14.09 , and $16.94 for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P214_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $315,000 , $361,000 , and $360,000 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P215_S1	Subject to limited exceptions, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company s common shares or announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common shares.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P215_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P216_S0	On March 24, 2014 the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing an annual dividend rate of $0.16 per share.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P216_S1	The dividend was paid on May 19, 2014 to shareholders of record on May 9, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P217_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P217_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P217_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P218_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P218_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $14,480,000 and $17,119,000 as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 7).
1005229_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P222_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P222_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P222_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P222_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2015.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P223_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P223_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P223_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P223_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $7,000,000 and $12,000,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 18 to 30 years from March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $8,854,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,000,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P224_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P225_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $5,626,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2014 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P227_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P228_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P229_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company initiated and completed employee workforce reductions at one of its European facilities.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P229_S1	These reductions resulted in approximately $413,000 in one-time termination benefits recorded as restructuring costs during the year ended March 31, 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P229_S2	These restructuring charges were fully paid by March 31, 2012.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P230_S0	During year ended March 31, 2012, the Company recognized a gain of $1,462,000 on the sale of a previously closed manufacturing facility.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P230_S1	The gain was recorded as a credit to restructuring expenses.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P231_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P231_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	The provision for income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P233_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P234_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $37,765,000 and $51,347,000 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P235_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P236_S0	As a result of the improved operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P236_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P237_S0	The valuation allowance includes $1,976,000 , $1,660,000 and $1,358,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P237_S1	The increase in foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to net operating losses in four of the Company s subsidiaries.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P237_S2	The Company s foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that range from five years to indefinite.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P238_S0	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2034.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P238_S1	The federal tax credits have expiration dates starting in 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P239_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P240_S0	The net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P240_S1	The net current deferred tax liabilities are included in accrued liabilities.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P240_S2	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P241_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $11,459,000 , $18,322,000 , and $18,590,000 for the years ended March 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012, respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P241_S1	As of March 31, 2014 , the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $119,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P241_S2	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P241_S3	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P242_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1005229_14_ITEM8_P242_S1	The tax effects to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as an increase in (reduction to) income tax expense, were $613,000 and $(576,000) in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P242_S2	The fiscal 2013 tax shortfall was also recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a decrease in deferred tax assets.
1005229_14_ITEM8_P243_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM8_P244_S0	The Company had $214,000 and $142,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

1005229_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supe rvision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (COSO).
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Hebetechnik Gesellschaft m.b.H on June 1, 2013 and Unified Industries, Inc. on February 28, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The entities acquired were excluded from management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The results of the two entities are included in the Company's fiscal 2014 consolidated financial statements and collectively constituted $30,015,000 and $23,114,000 of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2014 and $9,343,000 and $380,000 of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over f inancial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P5_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	One of the Company s foreign locations implemented the enterprise resource planning system SAP during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	We expect to convert certain additional plant locations to SAP during fiscal 2015.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P8_S2	We expect that the completion of these system implementations will enhance our internal controls as follows:
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	The new enterprise resource planning system was designed to generate reports and other information used to account for transactions and reduce the number of manual processes employed by the Company; b.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	The new enterprise resource planning system is technologically advanced and is expected to increase the amount of application controls used to process data; and c. The Company will design new processes and implement new procedures in connection with the implementations.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	There have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1005229_14_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Columbus McKinnon Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P12_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P12_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P15_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Unified Industries, Inc. and Hebetechnik Gesellschaft m.b.H, which are included in the March 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements of Columbus McKinnon Corporation and constituted $30,015,000 and $23,114,000 of total and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2014, and $9,343,000 and $380,000 of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_14_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Columbus McKinnon Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Unified Industries, Inc. and Hebetechnik Gesellschaft m.b.H.

1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling other products.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell other products through our existing distribution channels in that region.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Pfaff, Shaw-Box, Unified, STB, and Yale, are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the manufacturing industry capacity utilization, industrial production and general economic activity indicators, like GDP.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for our Company.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	U.S. industrial capacity utilization increased to 78.1% in March 2015, trending up slightly from 77.6% in March 2014 but down slightly from 78.9% in December 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization was 81.0% in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, an increase from 80.3% during both the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	The European indicator reflects the continued slow recovery from the 2013 recession in Europe, while the U.S. indicator demonstrates relative stability in the U.S industrial sector.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P1_S5	In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for other countries in which we have a strong sales and marketing presence including China, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Russia.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We participate predominantly in the hoist, crane, and monorail sector.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several growth drivers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Productivity - We believe businesses respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Further, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Safety - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, businesses seek safer ways to lift and position loads.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Consolidation of Suppliers - In an effort to reduce costs and increase productivity, our channel partners and end-user customers are increasingly consolidating their suppliers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe that our broad product offering combined with our well established brand names will enable us to benefit from this consolidation and enhance our market share.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Leading North American Market Positions - We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists, alloy and high strength carbon steel chain and forged fittings, and actuators in North America.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	We have developed our leading market positions over our 140-year history by emphasizing safety, manufacturing excellence and superior service.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Approximately 72% of our U.S. net sales for the year ended March 31, 2015 were from product categories in which we believe we hold the number one market share.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	We believe that the strength of our established products and brands and our leading market positions provide us with significant competitive advantages, including preferred supplier status with a majority of our largest channel partners and end user customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P6_S4	Our large installed base of products also provides us with a significant competitive advantage in selling our products to existing customers as well as providing repair and replacement parts.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The following table summarizes the product categories where we believe we are the U.S. market leader:
1005229_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	_____________ (1) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived from survey information collected and provided by our trade associations in 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	(2) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparison of our net sales to net sales of one of our competitors and to estimates of total market sales from a trade association in 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	(3) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparing the number of our tire shredders in use and their capacity to estimates of the total number of tires shredded published by a trade association in 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	(4) Market share and market position are internal estimates derived from both the number of bids we win as a percentage of the total projects for which we submit bids and from estimates of our competitors net sales based on their relative position in distributor catalog's in 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe we offer the most comprehensive product lines in the markets we serve.

1005229_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	No single SKU comprises more than 1% of our sales, a testament to our broad and diversified product offering.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition, our brand names, including Budgit, Chester, CM, Coffing, Duff-Norton, Little Mule, Pfaff, Shaw-Box, Unified, STB, and Yale, are among the most recognized and respected in the industry.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The CM and Yale names have been synonymous with powered and manual hoists and were first developed and marketed under these brand names in the early 1900's.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	We believe that our strong brand name recognition and demonstrated performance have created customer loyalty and helps us maintain existing business, as well as capture additional business.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	We innovate and continually introduce new products to meet our changing customer needs.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	Products introduced or engineered for our customers during the last three fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 account for approximately 21.2% of our net sales.

1005229_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	We enjoy long-standing relationships with, and are a preferred provider to, the majority of our distributors and industrial buying groups.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	There has been consolidation among distributors of material handling equipment and we have benefited from this consolidation by maintaining and enhancing our relationships with leading distributors, as well as forming new relationships.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe our extensive distribution channels provide a significant competitive advantage and allow us to effectively market new product line extensions and promote cross-selling.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our largest customer represents approximately 3% of our total net sales and our top 10 customers represent approximately 17% of our total net sales.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Expanding Non-U.S. Markets - We have significantly grown our non-U.S. sales since becoming a public company in 1996.

1005229_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Consistent Free Cash Flow Generation and Access to Capital We have consistently generated positive free cash flow (which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) through periods of economic uncertainty by continually controlling our costs, improving our working capital management and reducing the capital intensity of our manufacturing operations.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	During fiscal 2015, we significantly enhanced our capital structure.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We refinanced our 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2019 with a $125 million term loan which has a considerably lower interest rate than the notes.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	We expect to save over $7,600,000 in interest annually based on this refinancing.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

1005229_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	The material handling industry remains highly fragmented.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes) and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes) and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; and for tire shredders is Granutech.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	At March 31, 2015, we had 2,747 employees; 1,446 in the U.S./Canada, 133 in Latin America, 943 in Europe and 225 in Asia.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Approximately 13% of our employees are represented under four separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2016 and April 2018.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P89_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; and electro-mechanical components.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S4	We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P90_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	We use interest rate swaps to maintain the Company's desired capital structure which is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, castings and electro-mechanical components are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, overhead light rail workstations, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P95_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P95_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P96_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P97_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $109,000.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S2	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S3	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S4	These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P98_S5	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2015 a total of $262,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	During the last five years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to maintain our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries, such as manufacturing, power generation and distribution, commercial construction, oil and gas exploration and refining, transportation, agriculture, logging, and mining that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing components in lower cost countries, in particular in China, Mexico, and Hungary.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing business.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $244,033,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the euro, the British Pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at their locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our revolving credit facility and Term Loan contain several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Vice President, EMEA.
1005229_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Amherst, New York and, as of March 31, 2015, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	**Facility will be closed and consolidated into the Kissing, Germany facility during fiscal 2016.
1005229_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition, we have a total of 48 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_15_ITEM2_P2_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	Because this liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	See Note 16 to our March 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2015, there were 484 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	During fiscal 2015, the Company initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share totaling $3,191,000.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 30, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared the payment a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend was paid on May 18, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 8, 2015 and totaled approximately $800,000.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	On May 26, 2015 the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $24.07 per share.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2010 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2015 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	As a result of the increased operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) During 2011, the Company recorded non-cash charge of $42,983,000 included within its provision for income taxes.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	As noted in footnote number (1) above, this valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P3_S2	The majority of this charge relates to the Company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the U.S was necessary.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	Accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	The existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P5_S1	If a cumulative loss threshold is met, the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P6_S0	(3) In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P6_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which was payable over 10 years ending in May 2012.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P6_S2	The full amount of this note had been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P6_S3	Principal payments received on the note had been recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P6_S4	As of March 31, 2013, the note was paid in full.
1005229_15_ITEM6_P7_S0	(4) Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable, term loan, and subordinated debt.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations, except in the section entitled Discontinued Operations.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes and rigging tools.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by the Company s superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 140-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Ongoing initiatives include growing revenue by increasing our penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces, pursuing new products and targeted vertical markets, and by improving our productivity.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on market expansion, customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	During fiscal 2015, we significantly enhanced our capital structure.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We elected to redeem our 7 7/8% Notes.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	In connection with this, we entered into a new $150,000,000 senior secured revolving credit facility and established a new $125,000,000 delayed draw senior secured term loan facility effective January 23, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our previous revolving credit facility was canceled as a result of this transaction.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	Both the revolver and the new term loan have five-year terms maturing in 2020.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	The proceeds from the new term loan and $25,000,000 in cash were used to redeem the 7 7/8% Notes.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	This refinancing provides additional flexibility to our capital structure by allowing prepayable debt and will significantly reduce our cash interest expense by approximately $7,600,000 annually.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P3_S7	The cash interest savings are based on a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.8% which reflects the Company s policy of maintaining a fixed interest ratio of 50-70%.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Additionally, our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 42% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies as well as benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our products.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have improved.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	However, over the past year, the Eurozone statistics have been relatively flat as the outlook for the Eurozone appears to be for low growth in the coming year.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments and actuators.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, automotive, heavy OEM, entertainment, and construction and infrastructure.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduced defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduced warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	We are also aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities to enhance future margins.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering and opportunities for non-U.S. market penetration.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Our actual fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio, as calculated per the terms of our New Revolving Credit Facility, were 0.89x and 4.52x, respectively, at March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The New Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all U.S. inventory, receivables, equipment, real property, subsidiary stock (limited to 65% of non-U.S. subsidiaries) and intellectual property.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The New Credit Agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	On February 19, 2015, the Company borrowed $124,442,000 under the Term Loan.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Term Loan proceeds were net of fees paid to creditors of $558,000 which were accounted for as a debt discount.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	On February 23, 2015 the Company redeemed all of the outstanding $150,000,000 of the 7 7 / 8% Notes.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	The redemption was funded by the Term Loan and cash on hand.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The unused portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility totaled $143,546,000 net of outstanding borrowings of $0 and outstanding letters of credit of $6,454,000 as of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2015 consisted of $1,790,000 in commercial letters of credit and $4,664,000 of standby letters of credit.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of March 31, 2015, by period of estimated payments due:
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	(a) As described in Note 12 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	(b) As described in Note 18 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	(c) We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $40 million.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	(d) Estimated for our Term Loan and interest rate swap as described in Note 10 and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S5	Calculated using a 3-month LIBOR rate of 0.3% plus applicable margin of 1.5%.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S6	(e) For additional details, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P62_S7	Excludes uncertain tax positions of $1.8 million shown separately above.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements and enhance safety.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $17,243,000 , $20,846,000 and $14,879,000 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Excluded from fiscal 2015 capital expenditures is $1,216,000 in property, plant and equipment purchases included in accounts payable at March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $18,000,000 to $22,000,000, excluding acquisitions and strategic alliances.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance and workers compensation insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P65_S6	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to plan closures as well as divestitures and acquisitions.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013 the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 13 to our fiscal 2015 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	The weighted average pension discount rate assumptions of 3.83% , 4.60%, and 4.35%, as of March 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in the discount rate for fiscal 2015 resulted in a $19,400,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	Additionally, the Company adopted updated mortality tables in calculating its U.S. pension obligation.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	The change in mortality tables resulted in a $15,400,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	The increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2014 resulted in a $9,300,000 decrease in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.50% for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 65% equities and 35% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 was $57,339,000 and $37,457,000, or 21.9% and 16.6% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S7	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2015 and 2014 were approximately $11,013,000 and $11,041,000, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S8	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S9	Pension expense for the March 31, 2016 fiscal year is expected to approximate $700,000, less than the fiscal 2015 amount of $1,361,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S10	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2016 fiscal year are expected to approximate $5,908,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P73_S11	The compensation increase assumption of 2.3% as of March 31, 2015 and 2.0% as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 7.0% 7.0%, and 7.5% for fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	While the healthcare inflation rate assumptions have been decreasing, healthcare costs continue to outpace inflation in the U.S.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our goodwill balance of $121,461,000 as of March 31, 2015 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
1005229_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	Duff-Norton and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $9,563,000, and $111,898,000, respectively, at March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	We performed our qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2015 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units other than Rest of Products was less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Accordingly, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units other than the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method and comparable market method to estimate fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which the reporting unit operates.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The comparable market method estimates fair value based on prices obtained in actual transactions.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The method consists of examining selling prices for comparable assets.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	After studying the selling prices, value adjustments are made for any dissimilarities.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Testing goodwill for impairment under the two-step method requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	The key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first six years of our projections was approximately 3.8%.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after six years.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	These rates reflect our estimate of long-term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long-term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis as well as our normal annual price increases.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.1% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S7	We also consider any additional risk of the Rest of Product reporting unit achieving its forecast, and adjust the weighted-average cost of capital applied when determining the reporting unit s estimated fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S8	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S9	For example, a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $10,851,000 and an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $33,478,000 for the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P87_S10	Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting unit would be greater than its net book value as of February 28, 2015, necessitating no Step 2 calculations.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we completed a business combination for a total purchase price of $25,423,000 plus $6,487,000 in the assumption of debt.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	We identified and assigned value to trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, backlog, and patents.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a value of $3,408,000.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	The resulting goodwill was $9,487,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	At March 31, 2015 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,155,000.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance .
1005229_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	In fiscal year 2013 income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was not reflective of U.S. statutory rates.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 at March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether U.S. federal and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	In fiscal year 2013, we utilized the remaining U.S. federal NOLs thereby, reducing the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years, we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining NOLs and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	Management concluded that it is more likely than not that almost all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized; therefore, $49,161,000 of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance was reversed as of March 31, 2013.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	The guidance also requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	ASU 2015-03 is effective for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	This update is intended to improve certain areas of consolidation guidance by simplifying the consolidation evaluation process, and by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The provisions of this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.

1005229_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2015, 42% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, European currencies, the South African Rand, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, and the Chinese yuan.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $900,000 on our income from operations.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has a foreign currency forward agreement in place to offset changes in the value of an intercompany loan to a foreign subsidiary due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The notional amount of this derivative is $590,000 and the contract matures on April 15, 2016.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	This contract is marked to market each balance sheet date and is not designated as a hedge.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to hedge changes in the value of recorded foreign currency assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $672,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $8,624,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	From its March 31, 2015 balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $54,000 out of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the next 12 months based on the underlying transaction of the sale of the goods purchased.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by evaluating the need to enter into financial instrument transactions as appropriate.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	On February 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Term Loan, which has a variable interest rate.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The Company's desired capital structure, is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As such, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge changes in interest expense due to changes in the interest rate of the senior secured term loan.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The amortizing interest rate swap matures on February 19, 2020 and has a notional amount of $86,250,000 as of March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The effective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swap is reported in AOCL and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S5	The ineffective portion was not material and was recognized in the current period interest expense.
1005229_15_ITEM7A_P8_S6	From its March 31, 2015 balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $1,026,000 out of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the next 12 months.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated May 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) is a leading designer, marketer and manufacturer of material handling products and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure material.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, and actuators.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company s material handling products are sold globally principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P6_S3	During fiscal 2015 , approximately 58% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Advertising expenses were $2,147,000 , $2,492,000 , and $2,900,000 in fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	In the U.S., approximately 13% of the Company s employees are represented by four separate collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between August 2016 and April 2018.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	None of the collective bargaining agreements expire within 12 months .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates during the year.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P11_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange loss (gain).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	There were losses/(gains), including changes in the fair value of derivatives, on foreign currency transactions of approximately $863,000 , $1,124,000 , and $(45,000) in fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P13_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	To perform the two-step impairment test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	In estimating the terminal growth rate, the Company considers its historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which its reporting units operate.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect the Company s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2015 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units other than Rest of Products was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units other than the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Based on the results of the impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products reporting unit's fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	See Note 9 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 2 to 25 years.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Cost of approximately 35% and 40% of inventories at March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively, have been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Included within Other assets is a building that is held for sale in the amount of $854,000 at March 31, 2015 and 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	The building was closed as part of the Company's fiscal 2010 restructuring activities.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Research and development costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $5,242,000 , $5,470,000 , and $5,172,000 for the years ended March 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P38_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	All leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any option periods included in the determination of the lease term.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year and for certain products a lifetime warranty.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	On June 1, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Hebetechnik Gesellschaft m.b.H ( Hebetechnik ) located in Austria, a privately owned company with annual sales of approximately $10,000,000 .

1005229_15_ITEM8_P50_S4	The identifiable intangible asset consists of order backlog at the date of the acquisition and was estimated to have a three month useful life, all of which has been expensed as of March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P50_S5	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is deductible for Austrian tax purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	On February 28, 2014 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Unified Industries, Inc. ( Unified ) located in Howell, Michigan, a privately-owned company with annual sales of approximately $13,000,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Unified designs, manufacturers and markets overhead aluminum light rail workstations primarily used in automotive and other industrial applications.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Unified's products are a natural extension of the Company's hoist portfolio and are expected to broaden the scope of the Company's bundled product solutions.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	The results of Unified are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The acquisition of Unified is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

1005229_15_ITEM8_P58_S5	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The terms of the acquisition require the Company to pay additional consideration to the seller if certain performance measures are met by STB.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The potential additional consideration ranges from $0 to $3,681,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company has estimated the fair value of the liability related to this contingent consideration to be $982,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	This liability is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The value has been estimated by simulating the future performance of STB in a Geometric Brownian Motion model.

1005229_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	See Note 5 for assumptions used in the valuing of the intangible assets acquired.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company sold certain assets of the Gaffey division of Crane Equipment and Service, Inc.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	The sale of the Gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements for year ended March 31, 2013 and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	In fiscal 2014, the fair market value of unearned ESOP shares was determined based on the quoted market value of the Company s stock and consequently, the fair value was based on Level 1 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company primarily uses readily observable market data in conjunction with internally developed discounted cash flow valuation models when valuing its derivative portfolio and, consequently, the fair value of the Company s derivatives is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	The carrying value of the Company s Term Loan and senior debt approximate fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, their fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	In fiscal 2014, the Company used quoted prices in an inactive market when valuing its Subordinated Debt, represented by the 7 7/8% Notes due 2019, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (unregistered 7 7/8% Notes) and, consequently, the fair value was based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	At March 31, 2015, the term loan and senior debt have been recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2015 and 2014 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of STB, Unified and Hebetechnik described in Note 3.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The long term debt of STB was measured at fair value and subsequently repaid prior to March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S3	For STB significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 10.0% for customer relationships, a royalty rate of 1.0% for trademarks and domain names.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S4	For Unified, significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 8.0% for customer relationships, an engineering cost per hour of $57.20 for the engineered drawings, and a royalty rate of 1.5% for trademark and trade names.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P85_S5	For Hebetechnik, significant valuation inputs included a weighted average cost of capital of 12.3% .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Additional assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2015 and 2014 include the net assets of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting unit, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	These measurements have been used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	During fiscal 2015, Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products reporting unit cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P87_S2	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products reporting unit, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products reporting unit, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first six years of the projections was approximately 3.8% .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after six years.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P88_S4	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.1% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Similarly during fiscal 2014, the Company performed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for it s Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Duff-Norton reporting unit, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S2	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S3	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 5% .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S4	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 4.5% after five years.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P89_S5	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 12.8% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	See Note 9 for additional discussion on the Company's goodwill impairment assessment and the conclusions reached.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	There were LIFO liquidations resulting in $6,000 , $830,000 and $1,482,000 of additional income in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 income, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities and fixed income securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments, our intent and ability to hold the investments until their market values recover, and other market conditions in making this assessment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	Based on this assessment, no other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded during fiscal 2015, 2014, or 2013.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost basis of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .

1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the operating segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S5	The Company has four reporting units as of March 31, 2015 and five reporting units as of March 31, 2014.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S6	During fiscal 2015, the Unified Industries reporting unit (which designs, manufacturers and markets overhead light rail workstations) was incorporated into the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S7	It was considered a separate reporting unit in fiscal 2014, the fiscal year in which it was acquired.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P111_S8	The decision to incorporate the Unified Industries reporting unit into the Rest of Products reporting unit is consistent with the integration of Unified Industries into the Company's operations during fiscal 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	During fiscal 2014, Unified Industries had goodwill of $6,980,000.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	Only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2015 and only three of the five reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2014 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,563,000 and $9,865,000 at March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings design, manufacturing, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $111,898,000 and $102,458,000 at March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2015 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units other than Rest of Products was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units other than the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach and market approach.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P117_S3	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products reporting unit as of February 28, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	Based on the results of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products reporting unit's fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Goodwill is recognized net of accumulated impairment losses of $107,000,000 as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 .

1005229_15_ITEM8_P207_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all share based awards over the service period, which is the shorter of the period until the employees retirement eligibility dates or the service period for the award, for awards expected to vest.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P207_S3	Accordingly, expense is generally reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P207_S4	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	On July 26, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP or the "Plan").
1005229_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the LTIP.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P209_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 1,250,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the Prior Stock Plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Stock Plans.

1005229_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	Under the Plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P211_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of the Plan.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan ("Non-Qualified Plan") and an Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Incentive Plan").
1005229_15_ITEM8_P212_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four -year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P213_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2015 is as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2015 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 483,698 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2015 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 294,577 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $26.94 as of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $839,000 , $3,251,000 , and $332,000 during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P215_S5	As of March 31, 2015 , there are no options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	The grant date fair value of options that vested was $8.52 , $8.11 , and $9.21 during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1,607,000 and $2,194,000 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	As of March 31, 2015 , $1,861,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.

1005229_15_ITEM8_P220_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2015 :
1005229_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2015 :
1005229_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P223_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P223_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P223_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options was $10.67 , $8.98 , and $6.70 for options granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P223_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :
1005229_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P224_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P225_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P226_S1	Restricted shares for employees vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P227_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2015 is as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2015 is $2,314,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P228_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1,740,000 and $1,571,000 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P229_S1	Fiscal year 2015 performance shares granted are based upon the Company s Consolidated Net Revenue for the two year period ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P229_S2	Fiscal 2014 and 2013 performance shares granted are based upon the Company s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the one year periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P229_S3	Fiscal year 2015 , 2014, and 2013 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon the award earned and the fair market value as of March 31, 2015 , 2014, and 2013 respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P229_S4	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2015 is as follows:

1005229_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Company maintained a Restricted Stock Plan.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P232_S1	The Company charges compensation expense and shareholders equity for the market value of shares ratably over the restricted period.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P232_S2	Grantees that remain continuously employed with the Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P232_S3	As of March 31, 2015 , there were no shares available for future grants under the Restricted Stock Plan and no further outstanding grants.

1005229_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $25.43 , $24.92 , and $14.09 for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P234_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $440,000 , $315,000 , and $361,000 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P235_S1	Subject to limited exceptions, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company s common shares or announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common shares.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P235_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	On March 30, 2015 the Company's Board of Directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing an annual dividend rate of $0.16 per share.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P236_S1	The dividend was paid on May 18, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 8, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P237_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P237_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P238_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $12,530,000 and $14,480,000 as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P239_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 7).
1005229_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P241_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P242_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P242_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P242_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2016.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P243_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P243_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P243_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P243_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $6,700,000 and $11,200,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 37 years from March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $8,065,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,000,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P244_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P245_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P246_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $4,465,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2015 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P247_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P248_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P249_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P249_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P250_S0	The provision for income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P251_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P251_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P252_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $45,545,000 and $37,765,000 at March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P253_S0	The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P253_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P254_S0	As a result of the improved operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P254_S1	As a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P255_S0	The valuation allowance includes $1,207,000 , $1,976,000 and $1,660,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P255_S1	The decrease in the foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance at one of the Company's subsidiaries.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P255_S2	The Company s foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that range from five years to indefinite.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P256_S0	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2034.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P256_S1	The federal tax credits have indefinite expiration dates.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P257_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P258_S0	The net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P258_S1	The net current deferred tax liabilities are included in accrued liabilities.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P258_S2	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P259_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $10,570,000 , $11,459,000 , and $18,322,000 for the years ended March 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013, respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P259_S1	As of March 31, 2015 , the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $122,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P259_S2	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P259_S3	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P260_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1005229_15_ITEM8_P260_S1	The tax effects to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as an increase in (reduction to) income tax expense, were $(65,000) and $613,000 in fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P260_S2	The fiscal 2015 tax shortfall was also recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a decrease in deferred tax assets.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P261_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	The Company had $200,000 and $214,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_15_ITEM8_P262_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.

1005229_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (COSO).
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

1005229_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	STB was excluded from management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The results of STB are included in the Company's fiscal 2015 consolidated financial statements and constituted $32,882,000 and $27,456,000 of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2015 and $3,571,000 and $(150,000) of net sales and net income (loss), respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission issued an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework ("2013 Framework").
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Originally issued in 1992 ("1992 Framework"), the framework provides principles-based guidance for designing and implementing effective internal controls.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	As of March 31, 2015, the Company continues to utilize the 1992 Framework.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria) .

1005229_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P11_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P14_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Stahlhammer Bommern GmbH ( STB ), which is included in the March 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements of Columbus McKinnon Corporation and constituted $32,882,000 and $27,456,000 of total and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2015 and $3,571,000 and $(150,000) of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_15_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Columbus McKinnon Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of STB.

1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists and material handling drive systems, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling other products.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell other products through our existing distribution channels in that region.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S6	In September 2015, we significantly expanded our product offering with the acquisition of Magnetek, Inc. (Magnetek).
1005229_16_ITEM1_P0_S7	The acquisition combines Magnetek's technology with our broad line of lifting and positioning mechanical products to create a more comprehensive solution for customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Magnetek's digital power control systems serve the needs of selected niches of traditional and emerging markets that are becoming increasingly dependent on smart power.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Much of Magnetek's focus is on developing and introducing innovative electronic drive solutions that both enhance our customers' productivity, safety, and energy efficiency.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Electromotive Systems, Enrange, IMPULSE, M-FORCE, Mondel, OmniPulse, Pfaff, Quattro, Shaw-Box, Telemotive, Unified, STB, and Yale are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in industrial capacity utilization, industrial production and general economic activity indicators, like GDP.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for our Company.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	U.S. total industrial capacity utilization has declined to 74.9% in March 2016, compared to 77.3% in March 2015 and 75.4% in December 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization was 81.9% in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, an increase from the quarter ended December 31, 2015 of 81.5% and March 31, 2015 of 81.0%.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	The European indicator reflects the continued slow recovery from the 2013 recession in Europe, while the U.S. indicator is indicative of a declining industrial market.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	This was particularly evident in the mining and oil and gas sectors.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for other countries in which we have a strong sales and marketing presence including China, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	We participate predominantly in the hoist, crane, digital power control systems, elevator, and monorail sector.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several growth drivers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Productivity - We believe businesses respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	Further, our variable frequency AC drive products and DC digital controls are highly reliable, operate at high speeds, and improve production output, while reducing labor and energy costs.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	In addition, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Safety - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, businesses seek safer ways to lift and position loads.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our recent acquisition of Magnetek provides us with additional opportunities to enhance workplace safety and reduce the risk of accidents and personal injury, including collision avoidance software, programmable acceleration and deceleration, and other safeguards that prevent overheating, eliminate load swing, and prevent uneven lifting.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Consolidation of Suppliers - In an effort to reduce costs and increase productivity, our channel partners and end-user customers are increasingly consolidating their suppliers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe that our broad product offering combined with our well established brand names will enable us to benefit from this consolidation and enhance our market share.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Modernization and Upgrade of Existing Equipment - Overhead cranes, elevators, and mining equipment represent significant investments in capital which in most cases operate under severe duty and in some cases, in harsh environments.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Many of the structural components of these systems are manufactured to withstand significant mechanical forces, and to have useful lives in excess of 30 years.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	For example, it is not uncommon to find cranes that are more than 50 years old still operating today, or elevators or mining equipment operating with aging and inefficient power control equipment.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Rather than scrap structurally sound but outdated equipment, it is often more cost-effective to modernize the equipment to meet current operational needs by upgrading the power control systems.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our recently acquired drive technology along with our application expertise can provide reduced energy consumption, greater reliability, improved throughput, lower operational costs, enhanced features, and prolonged equipment life over older drive technology.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P8_S5	We believe our large installed base of product combined with our industry expertise provides us with opportunities to expand our business through modernization projects.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Conversion to Wireless Applications - Many industries, including the overhead material handling, mobile hydraulic, construction, and mining markets, are rapidly adopting remote wireless control solutions.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	While wireless control has been available for a number of years, technology has improved significantly in recent years, enabling enhancements that have resulted in products that are safer, more reliable, ergonomically designed, versatile, and cost-effective.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our recent acquisition of Magnetek provides us with an expanded wireless control product offering, which we believe will help us to meet demand, increase market share, and enter new markets in this growing field.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	In many electrical applications today, electronic devices controlled by microprocessors are increasingly being networked together, resulting in smart devices with greater productivity and user benefits.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	The benefits of this trend on control systems for industrial applications include lower installation costs, better monitoring of performance, improved integration with supervisory systems, and improved uptime.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe the development of "smart" hoists with the power of embedded and connected microprocessors will provide a tremendous benefit for users at all levels from maintenance to production users to meet their productivity, uptime and safety needs today and into the future.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Leading North American Market Positions - We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists, alloy and high strength carbon steel chain and forged fittings, digital power control systems, and actuators in North America.

1005229_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Approximately 13% of our employees are represented under three separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between May 2017 and April 2018.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P94_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P94_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S4	We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P95_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	We use interest rate swaps to maintain the Company's desired capital structure which is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses, castings, electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, overhead light rail workstations, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P100_S5	We also manufacture electronic systems to control cranes, hoists and various other powered equipment.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P101_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P102_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P102_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $47,000.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S2	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S3	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S4	These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P103_S5	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our recently acquired subsidiary Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P104_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P107_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P107_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P107_S3	We believe that FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P108_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	The Company has recorded a liability of $422,000 , included in the amount specified above, related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	FOL's inability to satisfy its remaining obligations to the state of Connecticut related to the Bridgeport facility and any offsite disposal locations, or the discovery of additional environmental contamination at the Bridgeport facility is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	The Company has recorded total liabilities of $890,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 on an undiscounted basis.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2016 a total of $1,153,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P112_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P112_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P113_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	During the last five years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to maintain our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries, such as manufacturing, power generation and distribution, commercial construction, oil and gas exploration and refining, transportation, agriculture, logging, and mining that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 37% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing components in lower cost countries, in particular in China, Mexico, and Hungary.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing business.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $223,314,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the South African Rand, and the Brazilian Real, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at their locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may face claims of infringement on the intellectual property of others, or others may infringe upon our intellectual property.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our future success depends in part on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and, despite our best efforts, we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Patent litigation is costly and, even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, we could be adversely affected financially should we be judged to have infringed upon the intellectual property of others.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our revolving credit facility and Term Loan contain several financial and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage or fixed charge coverage ratios in our bank credit facility.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store, and support multiple business activities.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel with the exception of Dr. Ivo Celi, our Vice President, EMEA.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have not completed an assessment of Magnetek's internal controls over financial reporting and therefore, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses may exist.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Under current SEC guidelines, the period in which management may omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the registrant's internal control may not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition, nor may such assessment be omitted from more than one annual management report on internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Pursuant to this guidance, we have excluded Magnetek, which was acquired on September 2, 2015, from the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	However, we will be required to include Magnetek in the scope of our assessment beginning in fiscal 2017.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In connection with our fiscal 2017 assessment, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Magnetek s internal control over financial reporting may be detected.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	To the extent that such deficiencies are identified, we may incur costs associated with our efforts to address these deficiencies that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Furthermore, if we are unable to correct such deficiencies in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data may be adversely affected, which may result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Such failure could materially and adversely impact our business and subject us to potential investigations, liability, and penalties.
1005229_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Getzville, New York (an owned property) and, as of March 31, 2016, conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 47 sales offices, distribution centers and warehouses.
1005229_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	Because this liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers for those policies to recover these expenses and future costs incurred.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that a gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements for more information on our asbestos claims.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2016, there were 467 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	During fiscal 2016, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share totaling $3,212,000.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 31, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared the payment a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend was paid on May 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 6, 2016 and totaled approximately $804,000.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	On May 27, 2016 the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $15.12 per share.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2011 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2016 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	As a result of the increased operating performance of the Company over the past several years, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	As a result of the determination that it was more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	As part of the sale of ASI, the Company received an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which was payable over 10 years ending in May 2012.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	The full amount of this note had been reserved due to the uncertainty of collection.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P3_S3	Principal payments received on the note had been recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P3_S4	As of March 31, 2013, the note was paid in full.
1005229_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable, term loan, and subordinated debt.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations, except in the section entitled Discontinued Operations.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position and secure materials and people.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	In September, we significantly expanded our product offering with the acquisition of Magnetek.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Key products include hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, and digital power control systems.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company is focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality provided by the Company s superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 141 -year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Ongoing initiatives include growing revenue by increasing our penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces, pursuing new products and targeted vertical markets, and by improving our productivity.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our sales and marketing activities, new product development and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on market expansion, customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 37% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies, as well as, benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	As in the past, we monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our products.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Since their June 2009 trough, these statistics have improved and have remained stable over the past year.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are investing in global markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments, actuators, and digital power and motion control systems for the material handling industry.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including energy, automotive, heavy OEM, entertainment, and construction and infrastructure.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduced defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduced warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our Lean efforts which are fundamentally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on-time delivery and productivity.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition to Lean, we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	We are also aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities to enhance future margins.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	We purchase approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural and others.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are also looking for opportunities for growth via strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The focus of our acquisition strategy centers on product line expansion in alignment with our existing core product offering and opportunities for non-U.S. market penetration.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	While we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our solid capital structure, including our cash position and flexible debt structure.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Fiscal 2016 sales were $597,103,000 , an increase of 3.0% , or $17,460,000 compared with fiscal 2015 sales of $579,643,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Sales for the year were positively impacted by $74,267,000 due to acquisitions and $5,605,000 by price increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Sales for the year were negatively impacted $33,082,000 due to a decrease in sales volume.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	The decline in sales volume was due to industrial recessions caused by weakness in oil gas, mining, heavy OEM, and commercial construction markets affecting our North American Hoist and Rigging and Latin American operations.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by $29,330,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our gross profit was $187,263,000 and $181,607,000 or 31.4% and 31.3% of net sales in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The fiscal 2016 increase in gross profit of $5,656,000 or 3.1% is the result of $24,316,000 from our recent acquisitions, $5,605,000 in price increases, $769,000 in reduced material costs, and $830,000 in reduced plant consolidation activities, offset by $11,438,000 in decreased volume, $3,337,000 in lower productivity due to reduced fixed cost absorption and inventory adjustments, net of other manufacturing costs, $2,051,000 in increased product liability costs, and $429,000 in facility impairment costs for a property held for sale.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The translation of foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on gross profit of $8,609,000.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling expenses were $72,858,000 and $69,819,000 or 12.2% and 12.0% of net sales in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The acquisitions of Magnetek and STB added an additional $7,640,000 in selling expense for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The consolidation of two warehouses and the closure of another added $859,000 to selling costs.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Additionally, foreign currency translation had a $5,036,000 favorable impact on selling expenses.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative expenses were $68,811,000 and $54,874,000 or 11.5% and 9.5% of net sales in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The fiscal 2016 increase was primarily the result of Magnetek acquisition transaction costs of $5,746,000 and acquisition-related severance costs of $2,300,000.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, Magnetek and STB added $5,774,000 in recurring general and administrated expenses.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	Additional increases are the result of lower information technology salaries capitalized as part of the global ERP systems project as well as general inflationary increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $2,622,000 favorable impact on general and administrative expenses.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Amortization of intangibles was $5,024,000 and $2,266,000 in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase relates to additional amortization of intangibles related to the Magnetek and STB acquisitions.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Interest and debt expense was $7,904,000 and $12,390,000 or 1.3% and 2.1% of net sales in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease in interest and debt expense relates to the redemption of the 7 7/8% Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 with the lower interest bearing Term Loan despite the increased borrowings used to fund the Magnetek purchase beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The fiscal 2015 cost of bond redemption of $8,567,000 relates to the call premium and write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our 7 7/8% Notes which were redeemed in February 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	This transaction is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

1005229_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance and workers compensation insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P64_S6	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges and other costs attributable to plan closures as well as divestitures and acquisitions.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 12 to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions and these differences are typically accounted for as actuarial gains or losses that are amortized over future periods.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The weighted average pension discount rate assumptions of 4.03% , 3.83%, and 4.60%, as of March 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	At September 2, 2015, the Company used a discount rate assumption of 4.30% in valuing the pension plan obligation acquired in the Magnetek acquisition.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	The change in the discount rate at March 31, 2016 did not result in a significant change in the total projected benefit obligation.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company adopted updated mortality tables in calculating its U.S. pension obligation.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The change in mortality tables resulted in a $5,700,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.22% for the year ended March 31, 2016, and 7.50% for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 65% equities and 35% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $103,279,000 and $57,339,000, or 24.5% and 21.9% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2016 and 2015 were approximately $5,936,000 and $11,013,000, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	Pension benefit for the March 31, 2017 fiscal year is expected to approximate $983,000, comparable to the fiscal 2016 benefit of $1,208,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S5	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2017 fiscal year are expected to approximate $5,961,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P73_S6	The weighted-average compensation increase assumption of 0.44% as of March 31, 2016 and 2.30% and 2.00% as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 6.8% for fiscal 2016 and 7.0% for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	While the healthcare inflation rate assumptions have been decreasing, healthcare costs continue to outpace inflation in the U.S.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 15 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses and increased limit factors.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P75_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our goodwill balance of $170,716,000 as of March 31, 2016 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, or in circumstances where the components share assets or other resources and have other economic interdependencies).
1005229_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	Duff-Norton and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $9,627,000 , and $161,089,000 , respectively, at March 31, 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	We also proceed to the two-step model when economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit due to the decline in our stock price during fiscal 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method and comparable market method to estimate fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which the reporting unit operates.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The comparable market method estimates fair value based on prices obtained in actual transactions.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The method consists of examining selling prices for comparable assets.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	After studying the selling prices, value adjustments are made for any dissimilarities.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	We performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products and Duff Norton reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	Testing goodwill for impairment under the two-step method requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	The key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 4.6% for the Rest of Products reporting unit and 4.0% for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years for both reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	These rates reflect our estimate of long-term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long-term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis as well as our normal annual price increases.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S6	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 9.9% and 10.0% for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, respectively based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S7	We also consider any additional risk of the Duff-Norton and Rest of Product reporting units achieving their forecast, and adjust the weighted-average cost of capital applied when determining the reporting unit s estimated fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S8	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S9	For example, a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $10,210,000 and $1,775,000 and an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $32,840,000 and $4,543,000 for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P85_S10	Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of February 29, 2016, necessitating no Step 2 calculations.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we completed a business combination for a total purchase price of $190,672,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	We identified and assigned value to trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, backlog, and patents.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a value of $105,998,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	The resulting goodwill was $49,204,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	At March 31, 2016 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,177,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Information regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this March 31, 2016 10K report.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2016, 37% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, European currencies, the South African Rand, the Mexican Peso, the Brazilian Real, and the Chinese Yuan.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $800,000 on our income from operations.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The notional amount of these derivatives is $2,118,000 and all of the contracts mature by June 30, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $14,585,000 and all contracts mature within twelve months of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	From its March 31, 2016 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $207,000 out of AOCL during the next 12 months based on the underlying transactions of the sales of the goods purchased.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The Company's policy is to maintain a capital structure that is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements in which the Company receives interest at a variable rate and pays interest at a fixed rate.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge changes in interest expense due to changes in the variable interest rate of the senior secured term loan.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The amortizing interest rate swaps mature on February 19, 2020 and have a total notional amount of $161,000,000 as of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The effective portion of the changes in fair values of the interest rate swaps is reported in AOCL and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the swap agreements.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The ineffective portion was not material and was recognized in the current period interest expense.
1005229_16_ITEM7A_P8_S5	From its March 31, 2016 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $700,000 out of AOCL, and into interest expense, during the next 12 months.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, effective March 31, 2016.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	None of the collective bargaining agreements expire within 12 months .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates during the year.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P13_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P15_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	To perform the two-step impairment test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	In estimating the terminal growth rate, the Company considers its historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which its reporting units operate.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect the Company s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Based on the results of step one of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products and Duff Norton reporting units' fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	See Note 8 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over its remaining useful life.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The fair values are determined in accordance with ASC 820.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 2 to 25 years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Cost of approximately 34% and 35% of inventories at March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively, have been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	The decrease in the percentage of LIFO inventory is due to the acquisition of Magnetek which determines the cost of its inventory using the FIFO method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Included within other assets is a building that is held for sale in the amount of $425,000 and $854,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The building was closed as part of the Company's fiscal 2010 restructuring activities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	During the year ended March 31, 2016 the Company reduced the asset held for sale to its current fair value less costs to sell resulting in additional expense of $429,000 in cost of products sold on the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Research and development (R D) costs as defined in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, were $7,393,000 , $5,242,000 , and $5,470,000 for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are classified as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The acquisition of Magnetek added $1,964,000 to R D costs for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other factors.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P39_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expense.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	See Note 14 for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	All leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any option periods included in the determination of the lease term.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year and for certain products a lifetime warranty.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	On December 30, 2014 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Stahlhammer Bommern GmbH ( STB ) located in Hamm, Germany, a privately-owned company with annual sales of approximately $16,000,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	STB manufactures a large range of lifting tools and forged parts that are able to withstand particularly heavy, static and dynamic loads, including single and ramshorn lifting hooks.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	The Company believes STB is a strong strategic fit allowing further expansion of the rigging business globally.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	The results of STB are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	The acquisition of STB is not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The acquisition of STB was funded with existing cash.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	The excess consideration of $7,818,000 has been recorded as goodwill.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include customer relationships of $2,957,000 , trademark and trade names of $1,301,000 , non-compete agreements of $221,000 , backlog of $74,000 , and patents of $82,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S4	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company increased the value of its customer relationships by $1,227,000 and decreased the liability for contingent consideration by $810,000 due to modifications made during the measurement period.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P52_S5	Both of these adjustments have reduced goodwill at March 31, 2016 by $1,669,000 and increased long term deferred tax liabilities by $368,000 as of the opening balance sheet date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The weighted average life of the acquired identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization was estimated at 9 years at the time of acquisition.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The terms of the acquisition require the Company to pay additional consideration to the seller if certain performance measures are met by STB.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	The potential additional consideration ranges from $0 to $3,681,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company had preliminarily estimated the fair value of the liability related to this contingent consideration to be $982,000 at March 31, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	The Company then adjusted this estimate to $172,000 during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P54_S4	This liability is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities as of the opening balance sheet date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The value has been estimated by simulating the future performance of STB in a Geometric Brownian Motion model.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	Key assumptions used in this model include a volatility factor of 45% and a credit risk adjusted discount rate of 3% .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	During fiscal year 2016 the Company revalued the contingent consideration based on updated performance forecasts.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P55_S3	Based on this revaluation, the liability related to the contingent consideration has been reduced to no value with the resulting gain recorded in cost of products sold on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P55_S4	External acquisition related costs totaling $150,000 have been expensed.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:

1005229_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	Of this amount, $4,609,000 and $822,000 is expected to be paid to the seller within one year of the periods ending March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	At March 31, 2015, $4,609,000 was expected to be paid to the seller in a time period exceeding one year.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company has recorded current assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets of $4,609,000 and $822,000 within prepaid expenses and other at March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	The excess consideration of $49,204,000 has preliminarily been recorded as goodwill.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include customer relationships of $41,000,000 , engineered drawings of $28,488,000 , trademark and trade names of $26,600,000 , patents and technology of $9,750,000 , and in-process research and development of $160,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P60_S3	The weighted average life of the acquired identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization was estimated at 18 years at the time of acquisition.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P60_S4	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P60_S5	The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Magnetek is not complete as of March 31, 2016 as the Company is continuing to gather information regarding Magnetek's contingent liabilities and intangible assets.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The preliminary assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	For each of the Company's acquisitions disclosed, goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that do not meet the criteria for separate recognition apart from goodwill, including assembled workforce, growth opportunities and increased presence in the markets served by the acquired companies.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	See Note 4 for assumptions used in valuing of the intangible assets acquired.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Magnetek had occurred as of April 1, 2013.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The pro forma information includes certain adjustments, including depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and certain other adjustments, together with related income tax effects.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	The pro forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions occurred as of April 1, 2013 and are not necessarily indicative of future results of the combined companies (in thousands, except per share data):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company primarily uses readily observable market data in conjunction with internally developed discounted cash flow valuation models when valuing its derivative portfolio and, consequently, the fair value of the Company s derivatives is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The carrying amount of the Company's annuity contract acquired in connection with the acquisition of Magnetek is recorded at net asset value of the contract and, consequently, it's fair value is based on Level 2 inputs and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	The carrying value of the Company s term loan, revolving credit facility, and senior debt approximate fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, their fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company did not have any non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	At March 31, 2016, the term loan, revolving credit facility, and senior debt have been recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2016 and 2015 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of Magnetek and STB described in Note 3.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The long term debt of STB was measured at fair value and subsequently repaid prior to March 31, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P82_S2	For STB significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 10.0% for customer relationships, a royalty rate of 1.0% for trademarks and domain names.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	For Magnetek, the valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the excess earnings approach, cost approach, relief from royalty approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	Significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 5.0% for customer relationships, an engineering cost per hour of $70.00 and obsolescence factors ranging from 0% to 80% for engineered drawings, a royalty rate of 2.5% for trademark and trade names, royalty rates ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% for patented technology, and a weighted average cost of capital of 11.6% .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Additional assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2016 and 2015 include the net assets of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	These measurements have been used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	During fiscal 2016, Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	For Rest of Products the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 4.6% .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting unit was determined to be 9.9% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	For the Duff-Norton reporting unit the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 4.0% .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P88_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.0% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company also measured indefinite-lived intangible assets from the Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries acquisitions on a non-recurring basis.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	The fair value measurements were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	In performing these analyses, royalty rates of 2.5% , 1.0% and 1.5% were used for the indefinitely-lived intangible assets of Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	A discount rate of 11.3% was used for each analysis.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	During fiscal 2015, Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products reporting unit cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products reporting unit, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products reporting unit, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 3.8% .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P91_S3	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P91_S4	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.1% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	See Note 8 for additional discussion on the Company's goodwill impairment assessment and the conclusions reached.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The acquisition of Magnetek contributed $16,659,000 to the increase in inventory since March 31, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	There were LIFO liquidations resulting in $384,000 , $6,000 and $830,000 of additional income in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 income, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities and fixed income securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments, our intent and ability to hold the investments until their market values recover, and other market conditions in making this assessment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P100_S3	Based on this assessment, no other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost basis of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	Since fiscal 2009, the Company has sold all of these previously written down investments, which resulted in the recognition of gains of approximately $27,000 , and $350,000 in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P101_S4	There were no such gains recorded in fiscal 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2016 (In thousands):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2016 are as follows (In thousands):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company considered the nature of the investments, causes of previous impairments, the severity and duration of unrealized losses and other factors and determined that the unrealized losses at March 31, 2016 were temporary in nature.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	Net realized gains related to sales of marketable securities are included in investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations and were $235,000 , $2,065,000 , and $854,000 , in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2015 (In thousands):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2015 are as follows (In thousands):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	In addition to the above, during the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company sold certain equity securities previously recorded on the consolidated statement of operations in prepaid expenses and other resulting in a gain of $1,354,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	This gain has been recorded within other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	Net unrealized gains included in the balance sheet amounted to $106,000 at March 31, 2016 and $465,000 at March 31, 2015 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The amounts, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $37,000 and $163,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	Consolidated property, plant, and equipment of the Company consisted of the following:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Buildings include assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $4,838,000 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	Machinery, equipment, and leasehold improvements include assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $694,000 and $737,000 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	Accumulated depreciation includes accumulated amortization of the assets recorded under capital leases amounting to $3,673,000 and $4,379,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, was $15,507,000 , $12,296,000 , and $11,399,000 , for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	Gross property, plant, and equipment includes capitalized software costs of $29,470,000 and $22,892,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	Accumulated depreciation includes accumulated amortization on capitalized software costs of $10,732,000 and $6,276,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	Amortization expense on capitalized software costs was $2,085,000 , $1,514,000 , and $932,000 during the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the operating segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S5	The Company has four reporting units as of March 31, 2016 and 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S6	Only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2016 and only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2015 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S7	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,627,000 and $9,563,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings design, manufacturing, digital power control systems, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $161,089,000 and $111,898,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P114_S8	Both STB and Magnetek have been determined to be part of the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach and market approach.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate and a terminal value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units as of February 29, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	Based on the results of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units' fair values were not less than their applicable carrying values.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P184_S1	The following sets forth a reconciliation of benefit obligation and the funded status of the plan:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	In fiscal 2017 , an estimated net loss of $37,000 for the defined benefit postretirement health care plans will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net periodic benefit cost.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P186_S1	In fiscal 2016 , net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	For measurement purposes, healthcare costs are assumed to increase 6.75% in fiscal 2017 , grading down over time to 5.0% in five years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P187_S1	The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 3.45% as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	Information about the expected benefit payments for the Company s postretirement health benefit plans is as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	Assumed medical claims cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company has collateralized split-dollar life insurance arrangements with two of its former officers.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S1	Under these arrangements, the Company pays certain premium costs on life insurance policies for the former officers.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S2	Upon the later of the death of the former officer or their spouse, the Company will receive all of the premiums paid to-date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S3	The net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2016 was $232,000 and the liability at March 31, 2016 is $4,467,000 with $4,327,000 included in other non-current liabilities and $140,000 included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S4	The cash surrender value of the policies is $2,754,000 and $2,528,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P190_S5	The balance is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans covering substantially all domestic employees.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P191_S1	Participants may elect to contribute basic contributions.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P191_S2	These plans provide for employer contributions based on employee eligibility and participation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P191_S3	The Company recorded a charge for such contributions of approximately $3,485,000 , $2,998,000 , and $2,658,000 for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P191_S4	The Company expects its contributions for the defined contribution plans in future years to remain comparable to its fiscal 2016 contributions.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company classified its investments within the categories of equity securities, fixed income securities, and cash equivalents, as the Company s management bases its investment objectives and decisions from these three categories.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P192_S1	The Company s investment policy as it relates to its pension assets is to invest in broad-based mutual funds, with an investment objective of being diversified.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P192_S2	Further the Company s investment objective of its equity securities is long-term growth, its objective of the fixed income securities is long-term growth, consistency of income and preservation of capital, and its objective of cash equivalents is preservation of capital.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P192_S3	It is the Company s position that its investment policy and investment objectives as defined above reduce the risk of concentrations within its investments.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	The fair values of the Company s defined benefit plans consolidated assets by asset category as of March 31 were as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	The fair values of our defined benefit plans consolidated assets were determined using the fair value hierarchy of inputs described in Note 4.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P194_S1	The fair values by category of inputs as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 were as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	Level 1 fixed income securities consist of fixed income mutual funds with quoted market prices.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Level 2 securities are investments in common collective trust funds and certain debt securities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P196_S1	The fair values of the common collective trust fund securities are determined based on the net asset value of these funds.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P196_S2	Each of these investment funds has a stated performance objective to approximate as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the stated benchmark to which the funds are indexed, over the long term.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P196_S3	Redemptions of the units held in these funds may be made on the last business day of each month and on at least one other business day during the month, based on the net asset value per unit of the funds.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P196_S4	We are not aware of any significant restrictions on the issuances or redemptions of units of participation in these funds.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	Debt securities categorized as level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids, or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields, and credit ratings.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	Fair value of Level 3 fixed income securities at the beginning of the year was $17,471,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P198_S1	During fiscal 2016 fixed income securities earned investment return of $767,000 and had disbursements of $380,000 resulting in an ending balance of $17,858,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	These fixed income securities consist primarily of insurance contracts which are carried at their liquidation value based on actuarial calculations and the terms of the contracts.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P199_S1	Significant inputs in determining the fair value for these contracts include company contributions, contract disbursements and stated interest rates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P199_S2	Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost and recorded as part of cost of sales, selling, or general and administrative expense.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	The guidance in ASC Topic 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and covered in sub-topic 718-40 "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released to employees, rather than based on their original cost.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	Also, dividends on those ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P200_S2	Rather, since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation expense is recorded.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P200_S3	Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares of the Company s common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a deduction from shareholders equity.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	Effective January 1, 2012 the ESOP was closed to new hires.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P202_S1	Prior to this date, substantially all of the Company s U.S. non-union employees were participants in the ESOP.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P202_S2	Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2015 the final loan payment was made by the ESOP to the Company.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	Contributions to the plan result from the release of collateralized shares as debt service payments are made.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P203_S1	Compensation expense was $0 , $251,000 , and $608,000 recorded in fiscal 2016, 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at their fair market value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P203_S2	Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt service.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	At March 31, 2016 and 2015 , 398,000 and 423,000 of ESOP shares, respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants accounts.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	There are no shares of collateralized common stock related to the ESOP loan outstanding at March 31, 2016 and no ESOP shares were pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P205_S2	Diluted earnings per share include any dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted stock.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P205_S3	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 282,000 , 114,000 , and 16,000 common shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, because they were antidilutive.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P205_S4	For the year ended March 31, 2016 an additional 77,000 in contingently issuable shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because a performance condition had not yet been met.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (share data presented in thousands):
1005229_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	The weighted-average common stock outstanding shown above is net of unallocated ESOP shares (see Note 13).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, applying the modified prospective method.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P208_S2	Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	Prior to the adoptions of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company maintained several different stock plans, specifically: 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, collectively referred to as the Prior Stock Plans .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P209_S1	The specifics of each of these plans are discussed below.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	Stock based compensation expense was $4,063,000 , $3,895,000 , and $3,633,000 for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expenses.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	The Company recognizes expense for all share based awards over the service period, which is the shorter of the period until the employees retirement eligibility dates or the service period for the award, for awards expected to vest.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P211_S2	Accordingly, expense is generally reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P211_S3	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	On July 26, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP or the "Plan").
1005229_16_ITEM8_P213_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the LTIP.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P213_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 1,250,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the Prior Stock Plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Stock Plans.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P213_S3	As of March 31, 2016 , 291,817 shares remain for future grants.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	Under the Plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of the Plan.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Magnetek, the Company agreed to continue the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan of Magnetek, Inc. (the "Magnetek Stock Plan").
1005229_16_ITEM8_P216_S1	In doing so, the Company has available under the Magnetek Stock Plan 205,602 of the Company's shares which can be granted to certain employees as stock based compensation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan ("Non-Qualified Plan") and an Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Incentive Plan").
1005229_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four -year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2016 is as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2016 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 201,498 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2016 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 164,391 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $15.76 as of March 31, 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $81,000 , $839,000 , and $3,251,000 during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P220_S5	As of March 31, 2016 , there are no options available for future grants under the two stock option plans.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P221_S0	The grant date fair value of options that vested was $8.85 , $8.52 , and $8.11 during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2016 and 2015 was approximately $242,000 and $1,607,000 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	As of March 31, 2016 , $2,045,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	Exercise prices for options outstanding as of March 31, 2016 , ranged from $13.10 to $28.45 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2016 :
1005229_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2016 :
1005229_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P228_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P228_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P228_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options was $8.58 , $10.67 , and $8.98 for options granted during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P228_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
1005229_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P229_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P230_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P231_S1	Restricted stock units for employees prior to fiscal 2016 vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P231_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2016 restricted stock units for employees vest ratably based on service one-quarter after each of years one, two, three, and four.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2016 is as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2016 is $5,267,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P233_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2,049,000 and $1,740,000 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S1	Fiscal year 2016 and 2015 performance shares granted are based upon the Company s Consolidated Net Revenue for the two year period ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S2	Fiscal 2014 performance shares granted are based upon the Company s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the one year period ended March 31, 2014.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S3	Fiscal year 2016 , 2015, and 2014 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon their grant date fair value.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S4	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P234_S5	During fiscal 2016, the Company determined that the fiscal year 2015 performance shares would not vest due to the performance condition not being met.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2016 is as follows:

1005229_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	The fair value of performance shares that vested during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $1,026,000 and $928,000 both years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	During fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , a total of 19,384 , 17,304 , and 12,642 shares of stock, respectively, were granted under the LTIP to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P238_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	On March 31, 2016 the Company's Board of Directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing an annual dividend rate of $0.16 per share.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	The dividend was paid on May 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 6, 2016 and totaled approximately $804,000 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P240_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $14,535,000 and $12,530,000 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P242_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 6).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon through its wholly-owned captive insurance company were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P244_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P245_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P245_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P245_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P245_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2017.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P246_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P246_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P246_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P246_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $5,400,000 and $8,300,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 37 years from March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $7,198,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,000,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P247_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P248_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers for those policies to recover these expenses and future costs incurred.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P248_S2	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that a gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $5,966,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Magnetek, the following loss contingencies have been assumed by the Company:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	Product Liability Magnetek has been named, along with multiple other defendants, in asbestos-related lawsuits associated with business operations previously acquired but which are no longer owned.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P254_S1	During Magnetek's ownership, none of the businesses produced or sold asbestos-containing products.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P254_S2	For such claims, Magnetek is uninsured and either contractually indemnified against liability, or contractually obligated to defend and indemnify the purchaser of these former business operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P254_S3	The Company aggressively seeks dismissal from these proceedings.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P254_S4	Based on actuarial information, the asbestos related liability including legal costs is estimated to be approximately $1,371,000 which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P255_S0	Litigation-Other In October 2010, Magnetek received a request for indemnification from Power-One, Inc. ("Power-One") for an Italian tax matter arising out of the sale of Magnetek's power electronics business to Power-One in October 2006.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P255_S1	With a reservation of rights, Magnetek affirmed its obligation to indemnify Power-One for certain pre-closing taxes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P255_S2	The sale included an Italian company, Magnetek, S.p.A., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Magnetek Electronics (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd. (the Power-One China Subsidiary ).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P256_S0	The tax authority in Arezzo, Italy, issued a notice of audit report in September 2010 wherein it asserted that the Power-One China Subsidiary had its administrative headquarters in Italy with fiscal residence in Italy and, therefore, is subject to taxation in Italy.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P256_S1	In November 2010, the tax authority issued a notice of tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004, alleging that taxes of approximately $2,200,000 (Euro 1,900,000) were due in Italy on taxable income earned by the Power-One China Subsidiary during this period.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P256_S2	In addition, the assessment alleges potential penalties together with interest in the amount of approximately $3,000,000 (Euro 2,600,000) for the alleged failure of the Power-One China Subsidiary to file its Italian tax return.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P256_S3	The Power-One China Subsidiary filed its response with the provincial tax commission of Arezzo, Italy in January 2011.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	The tax authority in Arezzo, Italy issued a tax inspection report in January 2011 for the periods July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006 claiming that the Power-One China Subsidiary failed to file Italian tax returns for the reported periods.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P257_S1	A hearing before the Tax Court was held in July 2012 on the tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P257_S2	In September 2012, the Tax Court ruled in favor of the Power-One China Subsidiary dismissing the tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P257_S3	In February 2013, the tax authority filed an appeal of the Tax Court's September 2012 ruling.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	The Regional Tax Commission of Florence heard the appeal of the tax assessment dismissal for the period of July 2003 to June 2004 and thereafter issued its ruling finding in favor of the tax authority.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P258_S1	Magnetek believes the court s decision was based upon erroneous interpretations of the applicable law and appealed the ruling to the Italian Supreme Court in April 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	In August 2012, the tax authority in Arezzo, Italy issued notices of tax assessment for the periods July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006, alleging that taxes of approximately $7,600,000 (Euro 6,700,000) were due in Italy on taxable income earned by the Power-One China Subsidiary together with an allegation of potential penalties in the amount of approximately $3,200,000 (Euro 2,800,000) for the alleged failure of the Power-One China Subsidiary to file its Italian tax returns.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P259_S1	On June 3, 2015, the Tax Court ruled in favor of the Power-One China Subsidiary dismissing the tax assessments for the periods of July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P260_S0	On July 27, 2015, the tax authority filed an appeal of the Tax Court's ruling of June 3, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P260_S1	In May 2016 the Regional Tax Court of Florence rejected the appeal of the tax authority and at the same time canceled the notices of assessment for the fiscal years of 2004/2005 and 2005/2006.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P260_S2	The tax authority has up to six months to appeal the decision.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P260_S3	The Company believes it will be successful and does not expect to incur a liability related to these tax assessments.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P261_S0	Environmental Matters From time to time, Magnetek has taken action to bring certain facilities associated with previously owned businesses into compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P261_S1	Upon the subsequent sale of certain businesses, Magnetek agreed to indemnify the buyers against environmental claims associated with the divested operations, subject to certain conditions and limitations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P261_S2	Remediation activities, including those related to indemnification obligations, did not involve material expenditures during the first nine months of fiscal year 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P262_S0	Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P262_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in the first nine months of fiscal year 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P262_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P263_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P263_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P264_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P265_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P265_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P265_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P265_S3	Magnetek further believes that FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P266_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P266_S1	DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P266_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P267_S0	The Company has recorded a liability of $422,000 , included in the amount specified above, related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P268_S0	FOL's inability to satisfy its remaining obligations to the state of Connecticut related to the Bridgeport facility and any offsite disposal locations, or the discovery of additional environmental contamination at the Bridgeport facility is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P269_S0	The Company has recorded total liabilities of $890,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 on an undiscounted basis.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P270_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P270_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P271_S0	The provision for income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P272_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P272_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S0	The Company early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) effective March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S1	The Update requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S2	The Company adopted this Update on a prospective basis.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S3	Therefore, the Company reclassified its current deferred tax assets included in prepaid expenses and other to deferred income taxes (noncurrent asset/noncurrent liability) on its Balance Sheet at March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S4	Net current deferred tax assets of $8,300,000 are included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P273_S5	Net current deferred tax liabilities of $158,000 are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P274_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $124,634,000 and $45,545,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P275_S0	The valuation allowance includes $3,426,000 , $1,207,000 and $1,976,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P275_S1	The increase in the foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to recording a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P275_S2	The Company s foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that expire in periods ranging from five years to indefinite.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P276_S0	The federal net operating losses arose from the acquisition of Magnetek and have expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2035.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P276_S1	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2035.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P276_S2	The federal tax credits have indefinite expiration dates.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P277_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P278_S0	The net current deferred tax assets are included in prepaid expenses.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P278_S1	The net current deferred tax liabilities are included in accrued liabilities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P278_S2	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P279_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $5,448,000 , $10,570,000 , and $11,459,000 for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014, respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P279_S1	As of March 31, 2016 , the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $95,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P279_S2	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P279_S3	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P280_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1005229_16_ITEM8_P280_S1	The tax effects to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as an increase in (reduction to) income tax expense, were $118,000 and $(65,000) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P280_S2	The fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax windfall (shortfall) was also recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as an increase (decrease) in deferred tax assets.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P281_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_16_ITEM8_P282_S0	The Company had $14,000 and $200,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P282_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P283_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2016 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P284_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P284_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010 resulting in no adjustments.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P284_S2	Current examinations include an IRS audit for the fiscal year 2015 U.S. income tax return and various state audits.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P285_S0	The Company s major tax jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P285_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2013 and in Germany for tax years prior to March 31, 2010.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P286_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitation prior to March 31, 2017.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P287_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 was $7,532,000 , $5,229,000 , and $5,397,000 , respectively.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P287_S1	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2016 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:

1005229_16_ITEM8_P306_S0	This ASU eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method, an investor must restate its historical financial statements, as if the equity method had been used during all previous periods.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P306_S1	Under the new guidance, at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method, any unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized through earnings.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P306_S2	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P307_S0	This ASU requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P307_S1	One of those criteria is that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract (the clearly and closely related criterion).
1005229_16_ITEM8_P307_S2	The amendments in this ASU clarify what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P307_S3	Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P309_S1	The amendments in this ASU clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P310_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P311_S2	Although we have not completed our assessment, we do not expect the adoption to change the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P311_S3	Information about our undiscounted future lease payments and the timing of those payments is in Note 17.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P315_S1	The adjustments related to previous reporting periods since the acquisition date must be disclosed by income statement line item either on the face of the income statement or in the notes.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P316_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P320_S1	SAB 115 rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletins series and brings existing guidance into conformity with ASU No. 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting, which provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P322_S1	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the entity should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software license.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P322_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the entity should account for the arrangement as a service contract.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P323_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P324_S1	Further, if a contribution or significant event occurs between the month-end date used to measure defined benefit plan asset and obligations and an entity's fiscal year-end, the entity should adjust the measurement of defined plan assets and obligations to reflect of those contributions of significant events.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P324_S2	However, an entity should not adjust the measurement of defined benefit plan asset and obligations for other events that occur between the month-end measurement and the entity's fiscal year-end that are not caused by the entity.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P324_S3	The amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P330_S1	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P330_S2	This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.

1005229_16_ITEM8_P332_S1	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1005229_16_ITEM8_P332_S2	The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

1005229_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO).
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Magnetek, Inc. ("Magnetek") on September 2, 2015.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Magnetek was excluded from management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The results of Magnetek are included in the Company's fiscal 2016 consolidated financial statements and constituted $256,162,000 and $194,394,000 of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2016 and $65,662,000 and $3,634,000 of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than what is described below.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Effective during our fiscal 2016, we are utilizing the 2013 version of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Columbus McKinnon Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P11_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P14_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Magnetek, Inc., which is included in the March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements of Columbus McKinnon Corporation and constituted $256,162,000 and $194,394,000 of total and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2016 and $65,662,000 and $3,634,000 of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Columbus McKinnon Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Magnetek, Inc.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P15_S0	In our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.
1005229_16_ITEM9A_P16_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2016 of Columbus McKinnon Corporation, and our report dated June 1, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position, and secure materials.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the U.S. market leader in hoists and material handling drive systems, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling our other products.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse, and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry, and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell other products through our existing distribution channels in that region, and with the acquisition of STAHL CraneSystems (STAHL) we are a leading producer of explosion-protected hoists.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P0_S6	In January 2017 the Company announced that it had acquired STAHL.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	STAHL manufactures explosion-protected hoists and crane components and is well known for its custom engineering of lifting solutions and hoisting technology.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil and gas, steel and concrete, power generation as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Electromotive Systems, Enrange, IMPULSE, M-FORCE, Mondel, OmniPulse, Pfaff, Quattro, Shaw-Box, Telemotive, Unified, STB, Yale, and now STAHL are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in industrial capacity utilization, industrial production, and general economic activity indicators, like GDP growth.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for our Company.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	U.S. total industrial capacity utilization has increased to 76.0% in March 2017 and December 2016 compared to 74.9% in March 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	Eurozone capacity utilization was 82.3% in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase from the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of 82.0% and March 31, 2016 of 81.9%.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The European indicator reflects the continued slow recovery from the 2013 recession in Europe, while the U.S. indicator is indicative of a growing industrial market.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for other countries in which we have a strong sales and marketing presence including China, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We participate predominantly in the hoist, crane, digital power control systems, elevator, and monorail sector.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several growth drivers.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Productivity - We believe businesses respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	Further, our variable frequency AC drive products and DC digital controls are highly reliable, operate at high speeds, and improve production output, while reducing labor and energy costs.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, emphasis on Lean techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Safety - Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers compensation expenses, businesses seek safer ways to lift and position loads.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our fiscal 2016 acquisition of Magnetek provides us with additional opportunities to enhance workplace safety and reduce the risk of accidents and personal injury, including collision avoidance software, programmable acceleration and deceleration, and other safeguards that prevent overheating, eliminate load swing, and prevent uneven lifting.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Modernization and Upgrade of Existing Equipment - Overhead cranes, elevators, and mining equipment represent significant investments in capital which in most cases operate under severe duty and in some cases, in harsh environments.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Many of the structural components of these systems are manufactured to withstand significant mechanical forces, and to have useful lives in excess of 30 years.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	For example, it is not uncommon to find cranes that are more than 50 years old still operating today, or elevators or mining equipment operating with aging and inefficient power control equipment.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	Rather than scrap structurally sound but outdated equipment, it is often more cost-effective to modernize the equipment to meet current operational needs by upgrading the power control systems.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our Magnetek drive technology along with our application expertise can provide reduced energy consumption, greater reliability, improved throughput, lower operational costs, enhanced features, and prolonged equipment life over older drive technology.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P8_S5	We believe our large installed base of product combined with our industry expertise provides us with opportunities to expand our business through modernization projects.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Conversion to Wireless Applications - Many industries, including the overhead material handling, mobile hydraulic, construction, and mining markets, are rapidly adopting remote wireless control solutions.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	While wireless control has been available for a number of years, technology has improved significantly in recent years, enabling enhancements that have resulted in products that are safer, more reliable, ergonomically designed, versatile, and cost-effective.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	Magnetek provides us with an expanded wireless control product offering, which we believe will help us to meet demand, increase market share, and enter new markets in this growing field.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In many electrical applications today, electronic devices controlled by microprocessors are increasingly being networked together, resulting in smart devices with greater productivity and user benefits.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	The benefits of this trend on control systems for industrial applications include lower installation costs, better monitoring of performance, improved integration with supervisory systems, and improved uptime.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe the development of "smart" hoists with the power of embedded and connected microprocessors will provide a tremendous benefit for users at all levels from maintenance to production users to meet their productivity, uptime, and safety needs today and into the future.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Leading North American Market Positions - We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists, alloy and high strength carbon steel chain and forged fittings, digital power control systems, and actuators in North America.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	We have developed our leading market positions over our 142 -year history by emphasizing safety, manufacturing excellence and superior service.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Approximately 67% of our U.S. net sales for the year ended March 31, 2017 were from product categories in which we believe we hold the number one market share.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	We believe that the strength of our established products and brands and our leading market positions provide us with significant competitive advantages, including preferred supplier status with a majority of our largest channel partners and end user customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	Our large installed base of products also provides us with a significant competitive advantage in selling our products to existing customers as well as providing repair and replacement parts.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	The following table summarizes the product categories where we believe we are the U.S. market leader:
1005229_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	_____________ (1) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived from survey information collected and provided by our trade associations in 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	(2) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparison of our net sales to net sales of one of our competitors and to estimates of total market sales from a trade association in 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	(3) Market share and market position data are internal estimates derived by comparing the number of our tire shredders in use and their capacity to estimates of the total number of tires shredded published by a trade association in 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	(4) Market share and market position are internal estimates derived from both the number of bids we win as a percentage of the total projects for which we submit bids and from estimates of our competitors net sales based on their relative position in distributor catalog's in 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	(5) Market share and market position are internal estimates derived from comparison of our net sales to the net sales of our competitors.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe we offer the most comprehensive product lines in the markets we serve.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We offer training, engineering, and design services to help channel partners and end users solve material handling problems.

1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	We complement our product offerings with training, engineering, and design services to assist our channel partners and end-users in finding the optimal solution for their material handling needs.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	The addition of STAHL further expands our hoist product offerings primarily in explosion-protected hoist and crane components.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S5	Our capability as a full-line supplier has allowed us to (i) provide our customers with one-stop shopping for material handling equipment, which meets some customers desires to reduce the number of their supply relationships in order to lower their costs, (ii) leverage our engineering, product development, and marketing costs over a larger sales base and (iii) achieve purchasing efficiencies on common materials used across our product lines.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P18_S6	No single SKU comprises more than 1% of our sales, a testament to our broad and diversified product offering.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition, our brand names (including Budgit, Chester, CM, Coffing, Duff-Norton, Electromotive Systems, Enrange, IMPULSE, Little Mule, M-FORCE, Mondel, OmniPulse, Pfaff, Quattro, Shaw-Box, Unified, STB, Telemotive, Yale, and STAHL) are among the most recognized and respected in the industry.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	The CM and Yale names have been synonymous with powered and manual hoists and were first developed and marketed under these brand names in the early 1900's.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The STAHL brand name was established in 1876 and is known for high quality hoist and crane components, including explosion-protected hoist and crane components.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	We believe that our strong brand name recognition and demonstrated performance have created customer loyalty and helps us maintain existing business, as well as capture additional business.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	We innovate and continually introduce new products to meet our changing customer needs.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Products introduced or engineered for our customers during the last three fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 account for approximately 18.1% of our fiscal 2017 net sales.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Distribution Channel Diversity and Strength - Our products are sold to over 17,500 general and specialty distributors, end users, OEMs, independent crane builders, and EPC firms globally.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We enjoy long-standing relationships with, and are a preferred provider to, the majority of our distributors and industrial buying groups.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe our extensive distribution channels provide a significant competitive advantage and allow us to effectively market new product line extensions and promote cross-selling.

1005229_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	OEMs that supply various component parts directly to other industrial manufacturers as well as private branding and packaging of our traditional products for material handling, lifting, positioning, and special purpose applications.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that purchase primarily load securing chain and forged attachments.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	We also provide our products to the U.S. and other governments for a variety of military applications.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	Independent Crane Builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms - In addition to the Distribution channels mentioned above, STAHL sells explosion-protected hoists and custom engineered off-standard hoists to independent crane builders and EPC firms.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Independent crane builders are lifting solution developers and final crane assemblers that source hoists as components.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P92_S2	EPC firms are responsible for project management or construction management of production facilities that purchase lifting solutions from crane and hoist builders.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	We maintain customer service departments staffed by trained personnel for all of our product lines, and regularly schedule product and service training schools for all customer service representatives and field sales personnel.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	Training programs for distribution and service station personnel, as well as for end-users, are scheduled on a regular basis at most of our facilities and in the field.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	We have over 216 service and repair stations worldwide that provide local and regional repair, warranty and general service work for distributors and end-users.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P93_S3	End-user trainees attending our various programs include representatives of 3M, DuPont, General Electric, and many other industrial and entertainment organizations.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	We also provide, in multiple languages, a variety of related material in video, CD-ROM, slide and print format addressing relevant material handling topics such as the care, use, and inspection of chains and hoists, and overhead lifting and positioning safety.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	In addition, we sponsor advisory boards made up of representatives of our primary distributors and service-after-sale network members who are invited to participate in discussions focused on improving products and service.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	These boards enable us and our primary distributors to exchange product and market information relevant to industry trends.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2017 was approximately $154,450,000 compared to approximately $98,572,000 at March 31, 2016 .
1005229_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	STAHL accounted for $46,771,000 of our backlog at March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	Orders for products that are manufactured to customer specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P95_S4	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	The material handling industry remains fragmented.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national, and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, which acquired Terex's Material Handling and Part Solutions business segment, and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company (acquired by Kito), and American Chain and Cable Company; for digital power control systems are Konecranes, Power Electronics International, Inc., Cattron Group International (a division of Laird Technologies), Conductix-Wampfler (a division of Delachaux Group), Control Techniques (a division of Emerson Electric), OMRON Corporation, KEB GmbH, and Fujitec; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton, and Nook Industries; and for tire shredders, Granutech.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	At March 31, 2017 , we had 3,380 employees; 1,649 in the U.S./Canada, 130 in Latin America, 1,390 in Europe and 211 in Asia.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	Approximately 10% of our employees are represented under three separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between September 2017 and May 2020 .
1005229_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P100_S3	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S3	We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S4	We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P101_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	We use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	We use interest rate swaps to maintain the Company's desired capital structure which is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment, and technology.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses, castings, electro-mechanical components, and standard variable drives are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, overhead light rail workstations, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S3	These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S4	Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P106_S5	We also manufacture electronic systems to control cranes, hoists, and various other powered equipment.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P107_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P108_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P108_S2	We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant ( the REC ) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P108_S3	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $11,000.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S1	Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S2	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S3	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S4	These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P109_S5	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our recently acquired subsidiary Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM1_P110_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P113_S3	FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P114_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P114_S3	The Company has recorded a liability of $678,000 related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	The Company has recorded total liabilities of $862,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 on an undiscounted basis.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2017 a total of $980,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P116_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P116_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P117_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business, and results of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	During the last eight years, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia have experienced substantial disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments, and declining valuations of others.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions and the extent to which such government actions may prove effective remains unclear.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The future economic environment may worsen.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to maintain our revenue and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Reduced revenue as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries, such as manufacturing, power generation and distribution, commercial construction, oil and gas exploration and refining, transportation, agriculture, logging, and mining that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The acquisition of STAHL on January 31, 2017 resulted in a significant increase to the Company s long term borrowings.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The increased amount of long term borrowings could, among other things, require the Company to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow to the servicing and repayment of its outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other operating activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In connection with acquisition of STAHL, we assumed an unfunded pension obligation which will further require cash flow to pay benefit obligations as they become due.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The STAHL pension obligation assumed in the acquisition is an unfunded pension plan valued at $72,638,000 at the date of the acquisition.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Therefore, the Company will be required to make current and future benefit payment obligations in addition to payments required to pay down other long term borrowings.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We have not completed an assessment of STAHL's internal controls over financial reporting and therefore, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses may exist.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under current SEC guidelines, the period in which management may omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the registrant's internal control may not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition, nor may such assessment be omitted from more than one annual management report on internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Pursuant to this guidance, we have excluded STAHL, which was acquired on January 31, 2017, from the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	However, we will be required to include STAHL in the scope of our assessment beginning in fiscal 2018.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In connection with our fiscal 2018 assessment, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in STAHL's internal control over financial reporting may be detected.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	To the extent that such deficiencies are identified, we may incur costs associated with our efforts to address these deficiencies that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Furthermore, if we are unable to correct such deficiencies in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data may be adversely affected, which may result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Such failure could materially and adversely impact our business and subject us to potential investigations, liability, and penalties.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , approximately 38% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability, and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing components in lower cost countries, in particular in China, Mexico, and Hungary.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing business.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $243,335,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 ) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the South African Rand, the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso, and the Chinese Yuan, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at their locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs, or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may face claims of infringement on the intellectual property of others, or others may infringe upon our intellectual property.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our future success depends in part on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and, despite our best efforts, we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Patent litigation is costly and, even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, we could be adversely affected financially should we be judged to have infringed upon the intellectual property of others.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our revolving credit facility and Term Loan contain a financial leverage covenant and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage ratio in our bank credit facility.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Other material adverse changes in our business could cause us to be in default of our debt covenants.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store, and support multiple business activities.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain, and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have entered into employment agreements with the following senior management personnel: Dr. Ivo Celi (our Vice President, EMEA), Dr. Thomas Peukert (our STAHL Managing Director), Werner Wagner (our STAHL Managing Director), and Mark D. Morelli (our President and CEO).
1005229_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Getzville, New York (an owned property) and, as of March 31, 2017 , conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 53 sales offices, distribution centers, and warehouses.
1005229_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_17_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P1_S2	Because this liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers of those policies to recover past expenses and to recover future costs incurred.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that a gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements for more information on our matters involving litigation.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2017, there were 486 holders of record of our common stock.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share totaling $3,422,000.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 27, 2017 , the Company's Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends of $0.04 per common share.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend was paid on May 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on May 5, 2017 and totaled approximately $903,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	On May 26, 2016 the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $25.16 per share.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2012 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders equity for each of the three years ended March 31, 2017 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected consolidated financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) The Company had a valuation allowance of $53,325,000 recorded as of March 31, 2012 due to the uncertainty of whether the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	The Company was able to utilize $14,567,000 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2013 which reduced the valuation allowance by $5,107,000.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	As a result of the improved operating performance of the Company leading up to and including fiscal 2013, the Company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the Company's remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	As a result of the determination that it was more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, a significant portion of the remaining U.S. valuation allowance totaling $49,161,000 was reversed in fiscal 2013.
1005229_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) Total debt includes all debt, including the current portion, notes payable, term loan, and subordinated debt.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer, and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position, and secure materials.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, digital power control systems, and actuators.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality in moving material provided by our superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 142-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Ongoing initiatives include growing revenue by increasing our penetration of the Asian, Latin American and European marketplaces, pursuing new products and targeted vertical markets, and by improving our productivity.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	In accordance with our strategy, we have been investing in our sales and marketing activities, new product development, and Lean efforts across the Company.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on market expansion, customer satisfaction, new product development, manufacturing efficiency, cost containment, and efficient capital investment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 31, 2017 we completed our acquisition of STAHL.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	STAHL is a leading manufacturer of explosion-protected hoists and crane components and is well known for its custom engineering of lifting solutions and hoisting technology.

1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	(a) As described in Note 11 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	(b) As described in Note 17 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	(c) We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our cancelable open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $53 million.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	(d) Estimated for our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility and interest rate swaps as described in Note 9 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S5	Calculated using a Eurocurrency rate of 1.15% plus an applicable margin of 3.00%.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S6	(e) For additional details, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P66_S7	Excludes uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million shown separately above.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing, and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, and enhance safety.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $14,368,000 , $22,320,000 , and 17,243,000 respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	Excluded from fiscal 2017 capital expenditures is $0 , $1,638,000, and $1,216,000 in property, plant and equipment purchases included in accounts payable at March 31, 2017 , 2016, and 2015, respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2018 to range from approximately $20,000,000 to $24,000,000, excluding acquisitions and strategic alliances.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance and workers compensation insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S4	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S5	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P69_S6	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges, and other costs attributable to plan closures as well as divestitures and acquisitions.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 12 to our fiscal 2017 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions and these differences are typically accounted for as actuarial gains or losses that are amortized over future periods.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The weighted average pension discount rate assumptions of 3.65% , 4.03% , and 3.83%, as of March 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	At January 31, 2017, the Company used a discount rate assumption of 1.90% in valuing the pension plan obligation acquired in the STAHL acquisition.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	The change in the discount rate at March 31, 2017 resulted in an approximately $1,000,000 increase to the projected benefit obligation.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	The weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 7.23% , 7.22% , and 7.50% for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, is based on the targeted plan asset allocation (approximately 65% equities and 35% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $150,431,000 and $103,279,000 , or 31.9% and 24.5% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	The increase in the under-funded status in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the pension liability assumed in the STAHL acquisition, which is an unfunded plan.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were approximately $6,140,000 and $5,936,000 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	Pension expense for the March 31, 2018 fiscal year is expected to approximate $435,000, greater than the fiscal 2017 benefit of $621,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S6	The additional expense expected in fiscal 2018 is the result of a full 12 months of STAHL pension expense.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S7	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2018 fiscal year are expected to approximate $8,416,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P77_S8	The weighted-average compensation increase assumption of 0.39% , 0.44% , and 2.30% as of March 31, 2017, 2016 , and 2015 , respectively is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 6.5% , 6.8%, and 7.0% for fiscal 2017, 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	While the healthcare inflation rate assumptions have been decreasing, healthcare costs continue to outpace inflation in the U.S.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 15 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses, and increased limit factors.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Our goodwill balance of $319,299,000 as of March 31, 2017 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, or in circumstances where the components share assets or other resources and have other economic interdependencies).
1005229_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	Duff-Norton and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $9,555,000 , and $309,744,000 , respectively, at March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy, and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	We also proceed to the two-step model when economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2017 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit due to volatility in our stock price and other changes in our business during fiscal 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	In order to perform the two-step impairment test, we use the discounted cash flow method and comparable market method to estimate fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Management projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	In estimating the terminal growth rate, we consider our historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which the reporting unit operates.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The comparable market method estimates fair value based on prices obtained in actual transactions.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	The method consists of examining selling prices for comparable assets.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	After studying the selling prices, value adjustments are made for any dissimilarities.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products and Duff Norton reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Testing goodwill for impairment under the two-step method requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	The key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	The compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 3.24% for the Rest of Products reporting unit and 3.9% for the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S4	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years for both reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S5	These rates reflect our estimate of long-term growth into perpetuity and approximate the long-term gross domestic product growth expected on a global basis as well as our normal annual price increases.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S6	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.0% and 10.2% for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, respectively based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S7	We also consider any additional risk of the Duff-Norton and Rest of Product reporting units achieving their forecast, and adjust the weighted-average cost of capital applied when determining the reporting unit s estimated fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S8	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S9	For example, a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $9,460,000 and $1,849,000 and an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $30,200,000 and $5,045,000 for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P89_S10	Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of February 28, 2017, necessitating no Step 2 calculations.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	We further test our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance of $46,018,000 consisting of trademarks on our recent acquisitions on an annual basis for impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	The methodology used to value trademarks is the relief from royalty method.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	The recorded book value of these trademarks in excess of the calculated fair value results in impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The key estimate used in this calculation consists of an overall royalty rate applied to the sales covered by the trademark.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	After performing this analysis, we determined that the trademark of STB with a balance of $1,125,000 was fully impaired.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Our other indefinite-lived trademarks were also tested for impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	It was determined that the fair value of these trademarks exceeded their fair values, and as such, no other impairment was recorded.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , we completed a business combination for a total purchase price of $248,729,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	We identified and assigned value to trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, favorable supply agreements, backlog, and technology.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S4	These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a preliminary value of $143,039,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P94_S5	The resulting goodwill was $150,322,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts, and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	At March 31, 2017 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,676,000.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Information regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this March 31, 2017 10K report.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions, and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in interest rates.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2017 , 38% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico, and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	With our recent acquisition of STAHL, we have an increased presence in the United Arab Emirates, with total assets of approximately $9,000,000.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, European currencies, the South African Rand, the Mexican Peso, the Brazilian Real, and the Chinese Yuan.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P2_S5	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $300,000 on our income from operations.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has cross currency swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge changes in the value of intercompany loans to a foreign subsidiary due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	This intercompany loan is related to the acquisition of STAHL.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The notional amount of these derivatives is $232,000,000 and all of the contracts mature by January 31, 2022.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	From its March 31, 2017 balance of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss), or AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $1,908,000 out of AOCL during the next 12 months based on the underlying transactions of the payments on the intercompany loans.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to offset changes in the value of other intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The notional amount of these derivatives is $3,682,000 and all of the contracts mature by March 31, 2018.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $10,790,000 and all contracts mature by March 31, 2018.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	From its March 31, 2017 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $33,000 out of AOCL during the next 12 months based on the underlying transactions of the sales of the goods purchased.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The Company's policy is to maintain a capital structure that is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements in which the Company receives interest at a variable rate and pays interest at a fixed rate.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge changes in interest expense due to changes in the variable interest rate of the senior secured term loan.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The amortizing interest rate swaps mature by December 31, 2023 and have a total notional amount of $259,500,000 as of March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The effective portion of the changes in fair values of the interest rate swaps is reported in AOCL and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the swap agreements.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The ineffective portion was not material and was recognized in the current period interest expense.
1005229_17_ITEM7A_P8_S5	From its March 31, 2017 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $1,121,000 out of AOCL, and into interest expense, during the next 12 months.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 31, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and other material handling products, which efficiently and safely move, lift, position, and secure materials.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, digital power control and delivery systems, and elevator application drive systems.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	On January 31, 2017, the Company acquired STAHL CraneSystems ( STAHL ).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P6_S3	STAHL is a leading manufacturer of explosion-protected hoists and crane components specializing in custom engineering of lifting solutions and hoisting technology.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P6_S4	STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil gas, steel concrete, power generation as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Company s material handling products are sold globally, principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	During fiscal 2017 , approximately 62% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	Advertising expenses were $1,748,000 , $1,690,000 , and $2,147,000 in fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Approximately 10% of the Company s employees are represented by three separate U.S. collective bargaining agreements which expire September 2017, April 2018, and May 2020 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	We plan to negotiate a new agreement for the plan that expires in September 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates during the year.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange loss (gain).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	There were net losses, including changes in the fair value of derivatives, on foreign currency transactions of approximately $1,232,000 , $2,215,000 , and $863,000 in fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, the Company proceeds to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	To perform the two-step impairment test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate, and the discount rate.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	In estimating the terminal growth rate, the Company considers its historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which its reporting units operate.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect the Company s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2017 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Based on the results of step one of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products and Duff Norton reporting units' fair value was not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	See Note 8 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over its remaining useful life.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The fair values are determined in accordance with ASC 820.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Accordingly, facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics, and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships, and technology.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 1 to 25 years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Similar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets (including trademarks on our recent acquisitions) are tested for impairment on an annual basis.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	The methodology used to value trademarks is the relief from royalty method.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The recorded book value of these trademarks in excess of the calculated fair value is an indicator of impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The key estimate used in this calculation consists of an overall royalty rate applied to the sales covered by the trademark.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	After performing this analysis, we determined that the trademark of STB with a balance of $1,125,000 was fully impaired.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Our other indefinite-lived trademarks were also tested for impairment.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	The pro forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions occurred as of April 1, 2015 and are not necessarily indicative of future results of the combined companies (in thousands, except per share data):
1005229_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company primarily uses readily observable market data in conjunction with internally developed discounted cash flow valuation models when valuing its derivative portfolio and, consequently, the fair value of the Company s derivatives is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	The carrying amount of the Company's annuity contract acquired in connection with the acquisition of Magnetek is recorded at net asset value of the contract and, consequently, its fair value is based on Level 2 inputs and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company uses quoted prices in an inactive market when valuing its term loan and, consequently, the fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	The carrying value of the Company s senior debt approximates fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, its fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company did not have any non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	At March 31, 2017 , the term loan, revolving credit facility, and senior debt have been recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2017 and 2016 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of STAHL, Ergomatic, and Magnetek described in Note 3.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P92_S3	For identifiable intangible assets these techniques included the excess earnings approach, cost approach, relief from royalty approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	For Ergomatic, the most significant valuation inputs included an engineering cost per hour of $40.86 for engineered drawings.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	For STAHL significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 10.0% for customer relationships, an estimated useful life of 15 years and royalty rate of 2.0% for developed technology, a royalty rate of 1.0% for trademark and trade names, and a weighted average cost of capital of 10.5% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	For Magnetek, significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 5.0% for customer relationships, an engineering cost per hour of $70.00 , and obsolescence factors ranging from 0% to 80% for engineered drawings, a royalty rate of 2.5% for trademark and trade names, royalty rates ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% for patented technology, and a weighted average cost of capital of 11.6% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	Additional assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2017 and 2016 include the net assets of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	These measurements have been used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	During fiscal 2017 , Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	For Rest of Products the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 3.2% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P99_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting unit was determined to be 10.0% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	For the Duff-Norton reporting unit the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 3.9% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.5% after five years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.2% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility, and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company also measured indefinite-lived intangible assets from the Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries acquisitions on a non-recurring basis.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The fair value measurements were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	In performing these analyses, royalty rates of 2.5% , 0.3% , and 1.3% were used for the indefinitely-lived intangible assets of Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries, respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P101_S3	A discount rate of 11.4% was used for each analysis.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	After performing the valuation above, the Company determined that the indefinite-lived STB intangible trademark asset was fully impaired.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	The impairment was due to lower cash flows and royalty rates than at the time of the acquisition.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P102_S2	The total impairment loss of $1,125,000 has been recorded within intangible asset impairment on the Company's statement of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	During fiscal 2016, Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	For Rest of Products the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 4.6% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting unit was determined to be 9.9% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	For the Duff-Norton reporting unit the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 4.0% .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.0% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility, and the size of their market capitalization.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities and fixed income securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments, our intent and ability to hold the investments until their market values recover, and other market conditions in making this assessment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	Based on this assessment, no other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , or 2015 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2009, because of uncertain market conditions and the duration at which certain securities had been trading below cost, the Company reduced the cost basis of certain equity securities since it was determined that the unrealized losses on those securities were other than temporary in nature.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	This determination resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax charge to earnings of $4,014,000 for the year ended March 31, 2009, classified within investment (income) loss.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	There were no other than temporary impairments for the years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .

1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the operating segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S6	Only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2017 and only two of the four reporting units carried goodwill at March 31, 2016 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S7	The Duff-Norton reporting unit (which designs, manufactures, and sources mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions) had goodwill of $9,555,000 and $9,627,000 at March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and the Rest of Products reporting unit (representing the hoist, chain, and forgings, digital power control systems, and distribution businesses) had goodwill of $309,744,000 and $161,089,000 at March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P129_S8	Both Magnetek and STAHL have been determined to be part of the Rest of Products reporting unit.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P130_S2	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2017 and determined that the two-step goodwill impairment test should be performed for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach and market approach.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The income approach uses a discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	This methodology recognizes value based on the expected receipt of future economic benefits.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P133_S2	Key assumptions in the income approach include a free cash flow projection, an estimated discount rate, a long-term growth rate, and a terminal value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P133_S3	These assumptions are based upon the Company s historical experience, current market trends and future expectations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units as of February 28, 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Based on the results of the two-step impairment test, the Company determined that the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units' fair values were not less than their applicable carrying values.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company s stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums, or other variables.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-30-35, indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	The Company assessed its indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of trademarks as of February 28, 2017 and determined that the indefinite-lived STB intangible trademark asset was fully impaired.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P136_S2	The impairment was due to lower cash flows and royalty rates than at the time of the acquisition.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P136_S3	The total impairment loss of $1,125,000 has been recorded within intangible asset impairment on the Company's statement of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Intangible assets at March 31, 2016 were as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	The Company s intangible assets that are considered to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which the assets are expected to generate future cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	The weighted-average amortization periods are 18 years for trademarks, 18 years for customer relationships, 18 years for acquired technology, 6 years for other, and 18 years in total.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	Trademarks with a book value of $46,018,000 have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not being amortized.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P142_S3	Total amortization expense was $8,105,000 , $5,024,000 , and $2,266,000 for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P208_S2	Further the Company s investment objective of its equity securities is long-term growth, its objective of the fixed income securities is long-term growth, consistency of income and preservation of capital, and its objective of cash equivalents is preservation of capital.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P208_S3	It is the Company s position that its investment policy and investment objectives as defined above reduce the risk of concentrations within its investments.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	The fair values of the Company s defined benefit plans consolidated assets by asset category as of March 31 were as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	The fair values of our defined benefit plans consolidated assets were determined using the fair value hierarchy of inputs described in Note 4.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P210_S1	The fair values by category of inputs as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 were as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	Level 1 fixed income securities consist of fixed income mutual funds with quoted market prices.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Level 2 securities are investments in common collective trust funds and certain debt securities.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P212_S1	The fair values of the common collective trust fund securities are determined based on the net asset value of these funds.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P212_S2	Each of these investment funds has a stated performance objective to approximate as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the stated benchmark to which the funds are indexed, over the long term.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P212_S3	Redemptions of the units held in these funds may be made on the last business day of each month and on at least one other business day during the month, based on the net asset value per unit of the funds.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P212_S4	We are not aware of any significant restrictions on the issuances or redemptions of units of participation in these funds.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	Fixed income securities categorized as level 2 are investments in a combination of funds whose underlying investments are in a variety of fixed income securities including foreign and domestic corporate bonds, securities issued by the US government, US and foreign government obligations, and other similar fixed income investments.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	The fair values of these funds are determined based on their net asset values.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	Fair value of Level 3 fixed income securities at the beginning of the year was $17,858,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	During fiscal 2017 fixed income securities earned investment return of $678,000 and had disbursements of $370,000 resulting in an ending balance of $18,166,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	These fixed income securities consist primarily of insurance contracts which are carried at their liquidation value based on actuarial calculations and the terms of the contracts.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	Significant inputs in determining the fair value for these contracts include company contributions, contract disbursements, and stated interest rates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost and recorded as part of cost of sales, selling, or general and administrative expense.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	The guidance in ASC Topic 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and covered in sub-topic 718-40 "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released to employees, rather than based on their original cost.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P217_S1	Also, dividends on those ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P217_S2	Rather, since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation expense is recorded.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P217_S3	Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares of the Company s common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P218_S1	An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a deduction from shareholders equity.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	Effective January 1, 2012 the ESOP was closed to new hires.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	Prior to this date, substantially all of the Company s U.S. non-union employees were participants in the ESOP.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2015 the final loan payment was made by the ESOP to the Company.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	Contributions to the plan result from the release of collateralized shares as debt service payments are made.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	There was no compensation expense in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P220_S2	Compensation expense of $251,000 was recorded in fiscal 2015 based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at their fair market value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P220_S3	Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt service.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	At March 31, 2017 and 2016 , 366,000 and 398,000 of ESOP shares, respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants accounts.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	There are no shares of collateralized common stock related to the ESOP loan outstanding at March 31, 2017 and no ESOP shares were pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P222_S2	Diluted earnings per share include any dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted stock.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P222_S3	Stock options and performance shares with respect to 340,000 , 282,000 , and 114,000 common shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, because they were antidilutive.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P222_S4	For the year ended March 31, 2017 an additional 119,000 in contingently issuable shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because a performance condition had not yet been met.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (share data presented in thousands):
1005229_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	The weighted-average common stock outstanding shown above is net of unallocated ESOP shares (see Note 13).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell in aggregate 2,273,000 shares of Common Shares to the following purchasers: Adage Capital Management, LP; Heights Capital Management, Inc.; and UBS O'Connor LLC.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P225_S1	The sale of the shares closed on January 30, 2017 at a price per Common Share of $22.00 , generating gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	The purchase agreement for the shares requires the Company to file an initial registration statement registering the common shares issued to the purchasers for resale.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	The filing of the registration statement was completed and declared effective on April 28, 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, applying the modified prospective method.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	This Statement requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P227_S2	Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	Prior to the adoptions of the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company maintained several different stock plans, specifically: 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, collectively referred to as the Prior Stock Plans.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	The specifics of each of these plans are discussed below.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	Stock based compensation expense was $5,914,000 , $4,063,000 , and $3,895,000 for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P229_S1	Fiscal 2017 expense includes additional expense related to the retirement of the Company's former CEO in February 2017.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P229_S2	At the time the former CEO retired, all outstanding stock awards immediately vested resulting in additional stock compensation expense of $1,427,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling, and general and administrative expenses.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	The Company recognizes expense for all share based awards over the service period, which is the shorter of the period until the employees retirement eligibility dates or the service period for the award, for awards expected to vest.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense for stock option awards and unvested restricted share awards that vest based on time or market parameters straight-line over the requisite service period for vesting of the award.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	On July 18, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP or the "Plan") which replaced the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P233_S1	The Company grants share based compensation to eligible participants under the 2016 LTIP.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P233_S2	The total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 2,000,000 including shares not previously authorized for issuance under any of the prior stock plans and any shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the prior stock plans.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P233_S3	As of March 31, 2017 , 1,402,194 shares remain for future grants.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P234_S0	The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	Under the Plan, the granting of awards to employees may take the form of options, restricted shares, and performance shares.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the number of shares, the term, the frequency and date, the type, the exercise periods, any performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be granted, and the restriction and other terms and conditions of each grant in accordance with terms of the Plan.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P236_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Magnetek, the Company agreed to continue the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan of Magnetek, Inc. (the "Magnetek Stock Plan").
1005229_17_ITEM8_P236_S1	In doing so, the Company has available under the Magnetek Stock Plan 164,461 of the Company's shares which can be granted to certain employees as stock based compensation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P237_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan ("Non-Qualified Plan") and an Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Incentive Plan").
1005229_17_ITEM8_P237_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P238_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four -year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P238_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P239_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2017 is as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P240_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2017 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 723,796 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P240_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2017 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 377,058 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P240_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $24.82 as of March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P240_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $252,000 , $81,000 , and $839,000 during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	The grant date fair value of options that vested was $8.56 , $8.85 , and $8.52 during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P242_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2017 and 2016 was approximately $439,000 and $242,000 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P243_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P244_S0	As of March 31, 2017 , $2,226,671 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.9 years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P245_S0	Exercise prices for options outstanding as of March 31, 2017 , ranged from $13.10 to $28.45 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P245_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2017 :
1005229_17_ITEM8_P246_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2017 :
1005229_17_ITEM8_P247_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P248_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P248_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P248_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P248_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options was $5.59 , $8.58 , and $10.67 for options granted during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P248_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 :
1005229_17_ITEM8_P249_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P249_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P250_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P251_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P251_S1	Restricted stock units for employees prior to fiscal 2017 vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P251_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2017 restricted stock units for employees vest ratably based on service one-quarter after each of years one, two, three, and four.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2017 is as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P253_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2017 is $5,578,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P253_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3,238,000 and $2,049,000 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S1	Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s Consolidated Net Revenue for the two year period ended March 31, 2018 , March 31, 2017 , and March 31, 2016, respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S2	Fiscal year 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon their grant date fair value.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S3	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S4	During fiscal 2017, the Company determined that the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 performance shares would not vest due to the performance condition not being met.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P254_S5	The Company reversed $181,000 in stock compensation expense related to these performance shares that was previously recorded in fiscal 2016.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P255_S0	A summary of the performance shares transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2017 is as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P256_S0	The Company had no unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested performance share awards as of March 31, 2017 as the performance criteria is not expected to be met.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P256_S1	The fair value of performance shares that vested during the year ended March 31, 2017 was $674,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P257_S0	During fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , a total of 27,960 , 19,384 , and 17,304 shares of stock, respectively, were granted under the LTIP to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P257_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $15.74 , $22.70 , and $25.43 for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P257_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was $440,000 for each of the three years.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P258_S0	On May 19, 2009 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a dividend distribution was declared of one preferred share purchase right to each outstanding common share of the Company.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P258_S1	Subject to limited exceptions, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company s common shares or announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common shares.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P258_S2	Under certain circumstances, each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of the newly created series A junior participating preferred shares of the Company at an exercise price of $80.00 per share.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P259_S0	On March 27, 2017 the Company's Board of Directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing an annual dividend rate of $0.16 per share.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P259_S1	The dividend was paid on May 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on May 5, 2017 and totaled approximately $903,000 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P260_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P260_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P260_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P261_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are the actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P261_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $13,335,000 and $14,535,000 as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P262_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 6).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P263_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P264_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon through its wholly-owned captive insurance company were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P264_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P264_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P265_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P265_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P265_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P265_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P265_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P266_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P266_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P266_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P266_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P266_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P267_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $4,700,000 and $7,400,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 37 years from March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P267_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $6,232,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P267_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P267_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P267_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,000,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P268_S0	a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P269_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P269_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers for those policies to recover these expenses and future costs incurred.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P269_S2	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that a gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P270_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P270_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P271_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $5,797,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P272_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P273_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P274_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Magnetek, the following loss contingencies have been assumed by the Company:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P275_S0	Product Liability Magnetek has been named, along with multiple other defendants, in asbestos-related lawsuits associated with business operations previously acquired but which are no longer owned.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P275_S1	During Magnetek's ownership, none of the businesses produced or sold asbestos-containing products.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P275_S2	For such claims, Magnetek is uninsured and either contractually indemnified against liability, or contractually obligated to defend and indemnify the purchaser of these former business operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P275_S3	The Company aggressively seeks dismissal from these proceedings.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P275_S4	Based on actuarial information, the asbestos related liability including legal costs is estimated to be approximately $1,306,000 which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P276_S0	Litigation-Other In October 2010, Magnetek received a request for indemnification from Power-One, Inc. ("Power-One") for an Italian tax matter arising out of the sale of Magnetek's power electronics business to Power-One in October 2006.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P276_S1	With a reservation of rights, Magnetek affirmed its obligation to indemnify Power-One for certain pre-closing taxes.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P276_S2	The sale included an Italian company, Magnetek, S.p.A., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Magnetek Electronics (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd. (the Power-One China Subsidiary ).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P277_S0	The tax authority in Arezzo, Italy, issued a notice of audit report in September 2010 wherein it asserted that the Power-One China Subsidiary had its administrative headquarters in Italy with fiscal residence in Italy and, therefore, is subject to taxation in Italy.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P277_S1	In November 2010, the tax authority issued a notice of tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004, alleging that taxes of approximately $2,000,000 (Euro 1,900,000) were due in Italy on taxable income earned by the Power-One China Subsidiary during this period.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P277_S2	In addition, the assessment alleges potential penalties together with interest in the amount of approximately $2,800,000 (Euro 2,600,000) for the alleged failure of the Power-One China Subsidiary to file its Italian tax return.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P277_S3	The Power-One China Subsidiary filed its response with the provincial tax commission of Arezzo, Italy in January 2011.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P278_S0	The tax authority in Arezzo, Italy issued a tax inspection report in January 2011 for the periods July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006 claiming that the Power-One China Subsidiary failed to file Italian tax returns for the reported periods.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P278_S1	A hearing before the Tax Court was held in July 2012 on the tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P278_S2	In September 2012, the Tax Court ruled in favor of the Power-One China Subsidiary dismissing the tax assessment for the period of July 2003 to June 2004.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P278_S3	In February 2013, the tax authority filed an appeal of the Tax Court's September 2012 ruling.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P279_S0	The Regional Tax Commission of Florence heard the appeal of the tax assessment dismissal for the period of July 2003 to June 2004 and thereafter issued its ruling finding in favor of the tax authority.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P279_S1	Magnetek believes the court s decision was based upon erroneous interpretations of the applicable law and appealed the ruling to the Italian Supreme Court in April 2015.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P280_S0	In August 2012, the tax authority in Arezzo, Italy issued notices of tax assessment for the periods July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006, alleging that taxes of approximately $7,100,000 (Euro 6,700,000) were due in Italy on taxable income earned by the Power-One China Subsidiary together with an allegation of potential penalties in the amount of approximately $3,000,000 (Euro 2,800,000) for the alleged failure of the Power-One China Subsidiary to file its Italian tax returns.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P280_S1	On June 3, 2015, the Tax Court ruled in favor of the Power-One China Subsidiary dismissing the tax assessments for the periods of July 2002 to June 2003 and July 2004 to December 2006.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S0	In May 2016, the Regional Tax Court of Florence rejected the appeal of the tax authority and at the same time canceled the notices of assessment for the fiscal years of 2004/2005 and 2005/2006.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S1	The tax authority had up to six months to appeal the decision.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S2	In December 2016, Magnetek was served by the Italian Revenue Service with two appeals to the Italian Supreme Court regarding the two positive judgments on the tax assessments for the fiscal periods 2004/2005 and 2005/2006.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S3	In March 2017, the tax authority rejected the appeal of the assessment for 2005/2006 fiscal year.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S4	The tax authority has until October 2017 to appeal this decision.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P281_S5	The Company believes it will be successful and does not expect to incur a liability related to those assessments.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P282_S0	Environmental Matters From time to time, Magnetek has taken action to bring certain facilities associated with previously owned businesses into compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P282_S1	Upon the subsequent sale of certain businesses, Magnetek agreed to indemnify the buyers against environmental claims associated with the divested operations, subject to certain conditions and limitations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P282_S2	Remediation activities, including those related to indemnification obligations, did not involve material expenditures during fiscal year 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P283_S0	Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P283_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2017 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P283_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties, and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P284_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P284_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P285_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P286_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P286_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P286_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P286_S3	Magnetek further believes that FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P287_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P287_S1	DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P287_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P288_S0	The Company has recorded a liability of $678,000 , included in the amount specified above, related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P289_S0	FOL's inability to satisfy its remaining obligations to the state of Connecticut related to the Bridgeport facility and any offsite disposal locations, or the discovery of additional environmental contamination at the Bridgeport facility is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P290_S0	The Company has recorded total liabilities of $862,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 on an undiscounted basis.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P291_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P291_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P292_S0	The provision for income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P293_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P293_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P294_S0	The net deferred tax asset decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of STAHL.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P295_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $125,612,000 and $124,634,000 at March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P296_S0	The valuation allowance includes $4,370,000 , $3,426,000 , and $1,207,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P296_S1	The increase in the foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to recording a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P296_S2	The Company s foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that expire in periods ranging from five years to indefinite.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P297_S0	The federal net operating losses arose from the acquisition of Magnetek and have expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2035.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P297_S1	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2035.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P297_S2	The federal tax credits have indefinite expiration dates.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P298_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:

1005229_17_ITEM8_P300_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $3,071,000 , $5,448,000 , and $10,570,000 for the years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P300_S1	As of March 31, 2017 , the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $116,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P300_S2	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the United States.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P300_S3	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P301_S0	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P301_S1	The tax effects to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as an increase in (reduction to) income tax expense, were $(197,000) and $118,000 in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P301_S2	The fiscal 2017 and 2016 tax windfall (shortfall) was also recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as an increase (decrease) in deferred tax assets.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P302_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P303_S0	The Company had $21,000 and $14,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P303_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P304_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2017 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P305_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P305_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010 resulting in no adjustments.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P305_S2	Current examinations include an IRS audit for the fiscal year 2015 U.S. income tax return and various state audits.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P306_S0	The Company s major tax jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P306_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2014 and in Germany for tax years prior to March 31, 2011.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P307_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitation prior to March 31, 2018 .
1005229_17_ITEM8_P308_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was $9,216,000 , $7,532,000 , and $5,229,000 , respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P309_S0	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2017 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P310_S0	ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P310_S1	The Company has one operating and reportable segment for both internal and external reporting purposes.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P314_S0	Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2017 and 2016 :
1005229_17_ITEM8_P315_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:
1005229_17_ITEM8_P316_S0	The deferred taxes related to the adjustments associated with the items included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, were $(5,579,000) , $4,753,000 , and $13,406,000 for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 respectively.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P316_S1	Refer to Note 16 for discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P316_S2	In the period subsequent to our initial recording of the valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, increases and decreases to both the deferred tax assets associated with items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the valuation allowance, have been recorded as offsets to comprehensive income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P317_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $10,006,000 charge in the minimum pension liability component, $935,000 benefit in the other post retirement obligations component, $747,000 charge in the split dollar life insurance arrangement component, and a $557,000 charge in the net unrealized investment gain component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P317_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2013, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P317_S2	This is in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, even though the valuation allowance was initially established by a charge against comprehensive income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P317_S3	These amounts will remain indefinitely as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P318_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $534,000 charge in the minimum pension liability component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P318_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P318_S2	This is in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, even though the valuation allowance was initially established by a charge against comprehensive income.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P318_S3	This amount will remain indefinitely as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P319_S0	The activity by year related to investments, including reclassification adjustments for activity included in earnings are as follows (all items shown net of tax):
1005229_17_ITEM8_P320_S0	Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income by component for the year ended March 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):
1005229_17_ITEM8_P321_S0	Details of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):
1005229_17_ITEM8_P322_S0	(1) These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P323_S0	The standard requires the current-service-cost component be disaggregated from the other components of net benefit cost.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P323_S1	The current-service-cost will be presented with current compensation costs for related employees and the other components of net benefit cost be presented elsewhere in the income statement outside of income from operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P323_S2	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within the fiscal year, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied to all periods presented.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P323_S3	The Company expects this will change the presentation of other components of net benefit cost on the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P324_S0	The standard removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill test.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P324_S1	Therefore, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value is greater than the reporting unit's fair value.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P326_S0	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P326_S1	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P326_S2	The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P327_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P329_S1	Specifically, ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P329_S2	In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P330_S0	The new revenue standard is effective for the Company on April 1, 2018.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P330_S1	We have made progress in evaluating the effect the new standard will have on the financial statements and expect a change in the timing of revenue recognition for some custom projects in the EMEA region.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P330_S2	Currently, certain rail and road and other custom projects are recognized at a point-in-time basis at or near the completion of the project, however, we expect these projects will be recognized earlier on an over time basis under the new revenue standard.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P330_S3	We cannot quantify the impact of this change at this time.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P330_S4	Based on the estimated impact to the financial statements we plan to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P331_S0	The standard clarifies the scope of nonfinancial asset derecognition to include in-substance nonfinancial assets thereby requiring the nonfinancial asset to be derecognized in a partial sale transactions when the company no longer has a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary and control of the asset is transferred in accordance with ASC 606.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P332_S0	The ASU amends industry specific guidance to align with the new revenue standard (ASC 606).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P332_S1	The effective date is aligned with the new revenue standard, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P334_S0	The standard amends certain SEC guidance regarding to include "additional qualitative disclosures" that a registrant is expected to disclose when it cannot reasonably estimate the impact of ASUs 2014-09 (Topic 606), 2016-02 (Topic 842), and 2016-03 (Topic 326).
1005229_17_ITEM8_P335_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P336_S0	The amendment narrows the definition of a business as the guidance requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the asset is not a business.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P337_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.

1005229_17_ITEM8_P340_S1	The standard requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included in the cash and cash equivalent balance in the statement of cash flows.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P340_S2	Further, a reconciliation between the balance sheet and statement of cash flows is required when the balance sheet includes more than one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents.
1005229_17_ITEM8_P340_S3	Therefore, transfers between these balances should no longer be presented as a cash flow activity.

1005229_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO).
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2017 .

1005229_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

1005229_17_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P10_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P13_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of STAHL CraneSystems, which is included in the March 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements of Columbus McKinnon Corporation and constituted $396,962,000 and $245,320,000 of total and net assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2017 and $24,682,000 and $(4,081,000) of net sales and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended.
1005229_17_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Columbus McKinnon Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of STAHL CraneSystems.

1005229_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	The goal of our strategy is to increase our earnings power and expand EBITDA margins, as well as improve our Return on Invested Capital.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Phase I, which began early in fiscal 2018, was focused on attaining operational control and instilling a performance based culture to drive results.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	We formed four teams of cross-functional experts (tiger teams) to address specific areas:
1005229_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Pay down debt incurred as a result of the STAHL acquisition.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	We also instituted a new operating system, Earnings Power Acceleration or E-PAS .

1005229_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that primarily purchase load securing chain and forged attachments.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We also provide our products to the U.S. and other governments for a variety of military applications.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Independent Crane Builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms - In addition to the Distribution channels mentioned above, STAHL sells explosion-protected hoists and custom engineered off-standard hoists to independent crane builders and EPC firms.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Independent crane builders are lifting solution developers and final crane assemblers that source hoists as components.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	EPC firms are responsible for project management or construction management of production facilities that purchase lifting solutions from crane and hoist builders.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2018 was approximately $177,387,000 compared to approximately $154,450,000 at March 31, 2017 .
1005229_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Orders for products that are manufactured to customer specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Fluctuations in backlog can reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The material handling industry remains fragmented.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	We face competition from a wide range of regional, national, and international manufacturers globally.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	We believe we have leading U.S. market share in various products categories including: hoists, trolleys and components, AC and DC material handling drives, screw jacks, tire shredders, and elevator DC drives.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	These product categories represent 64% of our U.S. net sales.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, which acquired Terex's Material Handling and Part Solutions business segment, and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company (acquired by Kito), and American Chain and Cable Company; for digital power control systems are Konecranes, Power Electronics International, Inc., Cattron Group International (a division of Laird Technologies), Conductix-Wampfler (a division of Delachaux Group), Control Techniques (a division of Emerson Electric), OMRON Corporation, KEB GmbH, and Fujitec; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton, and Nook Industries; and for tire shredders, Granutech.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	At March 31, 2018 , we had 3,328 employees globally.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	Approximately 10% of our employees are represented under three separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between May 2020 and September 2021.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	We have good relationships with our employees and positive, productive relationships with our unions.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	The risk of employee or union led disruption in production is remote.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	These commodities are all available from multiple sources.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	We have historically passed on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P58_S6	Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses, castings, electro-mechanical components, and standard variable drives are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S4	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P59_S5	However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the DENR ) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and the State accepted our proposal.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to be material and are fully reserved.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	The total annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our subsidiary Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	The DEP then requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	The Company has implemented the work plan and has recorded a liability of $283,000 related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	In September of 2017, Magnetek received a request for defense and indemnification from Monsanto Company, Pharmacia, LLC, and Solutia, Inc. (collectively, Monsanto ) with respect to: (1) lawsuits brought by plaintiffs claiming that Monsanto manufactured polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), exposure to which allegedly caused injury to plaintiffs; (2) lawsuits brought by municipalities and municipal entities claiming that Monsanto should be responsible for a variety of damages due to the presence of PCBs in bodies of water in those municipalities and/or in water treated by those municipal entities.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Monsanto claims to be entitled to defense and indemnification from Magnetek under a so-called Special Undertaking apparently executed by Universal in January of 1972, which purportedly required Universal to defend and indemnify Monsanto from liabilities arising out of or in connection with the receipt, purchase, possession, handling, use, sale or disposition of PCBs by Universal.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Magnetek has declined Monsanto s tender, and believes that it has meritorious legal and factual defenses to the demands made by Monsanto.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	Magnetek is vigorously defending against those demands and has commenced litigation to, among other things, declare the Special Undertaking void and unenforceable.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	Monsanto has, in turn, commenced an action to enforce the Special Undertaking.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P70_S3	Magnetek intends to continue to vigorously prosecute its declaratory judgment action and to defend against Monsanto s action against it.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P70_S4	As of March 31, 2018 the Company has recorded $400,000 for legal costs incurred to date and expected to be incurred related to this matter.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	We cannot reasonably estimate a potential range of loss with respect to Monsanto s tender because there is insufficient information regarding the underlying matters.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Management believes, however, that the potential additional costs related to such matters, if any, will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2018 a total of $1,029,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our internet address is www.cmworks.com .
1005229_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Columbus McKinnon is subject to a number of risk factors that could negatively affect our results from business operations or cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward looking statement.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Adverse changes in global economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business, and results of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our industry is affected by changes in economic conditions outside our control, which can result in a general decrease in product demand from our customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to maintain our revenue and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Reduced revenue as a result of decreased demand may also reduce our planned growth and otherwise hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long term strategy.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of the end-users of our products are in highly cyclical industries, such as manufacturing, power generation and distribution, commercial construction, oil and gas exploration and refining, transportation, agriculture, logging, and mining that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Their demand for our products, and thus our results of operations, is directly related to the level of production in their facilities, which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is highly competitive and subject to consolidation of competitors.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition is based primarily on customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, through consolidation, some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The acquisition of STAHL on January 31, 2017 resulted in a significant increase to the Company s long term borrowings.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The increased amount of long term borrowings could, among other things, require the Company to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow to the servicing and repayment of its outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other operating activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In connection with the acquisition of STAHL, we assumed an unfunded pension obligation which will further require cash flow to pay benefit obligations as they become due.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The STAHL pension obligation assumed in the acquisition is an unfunded pension plan valued at $85,851,000 at March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Therefore, the Company will be required to make current and future benefit payment obligations in addition to payments required to pay down other long term borrowings.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our operations outside the U.S. pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We have operations and assets located outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Hungary.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, we import a portion of our hoist product line from Asia, and sell our products to distributors located in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 , approximately 47% of our net sales were derived from non-U.S. markets.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our U.S. business, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, U.S. and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability, and terms of financing, political instability and risks of increases in taxes.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Also, in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	These factors may adversely affect our future profits.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing components in lower cost countries, in particular in China, Mexico, and Hungary.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above, and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our strategy depends on successful integration of acquisitions.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing business.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our acquisition strategy, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or expand into new markets, our sales and earnings growth could be reduced.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage, which exposes us to potential liability.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We maintain insurance through a combination of self-insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self-insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self-insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self-insurance amounts.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition, or liquidity.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Based on this review, we estimate our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this form 10K.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As indicated above, our self-insurance coverage is effected through our captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The reserves of our captive insurance subsidiary are subject to periodic adjustments based upon actuarial evaluations, which adjustments impact our overall results of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These periodic adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to currency fluctuations from our sales outside the U.S.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our products are sold in many countries around the world.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Thus, a portion of our revenues (approximately $395,986,000 in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 ) are generated in foreign currencies, including principally the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the South African Rand, the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso, and the Chinese Yuan, and while much of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in the same currency, a portion is incurred in other currencies.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on our earnings.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel or other material prices.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The principal raw material used in our chain, forging and crane building operations is steel.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical, and at times pricing and availability can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	During historical rising cost periods, we were generally successful in adding and maintaining a surcharge to the prices of our high steel content products or incorporating them into price increases, with a goal of margin neutrality.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In the future, to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	For the most part, we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end-user customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at their locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our end-user customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	For the most part, we do not have written agreements with our distributors.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such requirements.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations (such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment), could result in substantial costs to us, including operating costs and capital expenditures, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, clean-up costs, or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years, and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Over time, we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Additional environmental liabilities could exist, including clean-up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed, which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may face claims of infringement on the intellectual property of others, or others may infringe upon our intellectual property.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our future success depends in part on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and, despite our best efforts, we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Patent litigation is costly and, even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, we could be adversely affected financially should we be judged to have infringed upon the intellectual property of others.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Some of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our revolving credit facility and Term Loan contain a financial leverage covenant and other restrictive covenants.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	A significant decline in our operating income or cash generating ability could cause us to violate our leverage ratio in our bank credit facility.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Other material adverse changes in our business could cause us to be in default of our debt covenants.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our indebtedness.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store, and support multiple business activities.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain, and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We continually evaluate and assess our personnel and may make additional changes to the members or assignments of our senior management team in the future.
1005229_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have entered into employment agreements with the following senior management personnel: Werner Wagner (our STAHL Managing Director) and Mark D. Morelli (our President and CEO).
1005229_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our corporate headquarters in Getzville, New York (an owned property) and, as of March 31, 2018 , conducted our principal manufacturing at the following facilities:
1005229_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we have a total of 45 sales offices, distribution centers, and warehouses.
1005229_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted.
1005229_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future.
1005229_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the expiration of our current leases, we believe that either we will be able to secure renewal terms or enter into leases for alternative locations at market terms.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	We do not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on our business.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	We maintain comprehensive general product liability insurance against risks arising out of the use of our products sold to customers through our wholly-owned New York State captive insurance subsidiary of which we are the sole policy holder.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition to the per occurrence limits, our coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S6	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM3_P0_S7	We obtain additional insurance coverage from independent insurers to cover potential losses in excess of these limits.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, we are also involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos-related liability, we review, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, our recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against us, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	Because this liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers of those policies to recover past expenses and to recover future costs incurred.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Company recovered $2,362,000 from insurance carriers during fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that an additional gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	See Note 15 to our March 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements for more information on our matters involving litigation.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CMCO.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of April 30, 2018 , there were 381 holders of record of our common stock.

1005229_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 26, 2018 , the Company's Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends of $0.05 per common share.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend was paid on May 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 4, 2018 and totaled approximately $1,150,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our current credit agreement allows, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	On May 25, 2018 the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $37.75 per share.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Performance Graph shown below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock based on its market price, with the total return of the S P SmallCap 600 Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Diversified Industrials.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	The comparison of total return assumes that a fixed investment of $100 was invested on March 31, 2013 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.
1005229_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	The stock price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.

1005229_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer, and marketer of material handling products, systems and services which efficiently and safely move, lift, position, and secure materials.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, digital power control systems, and actuators.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are focused on serving commercial and industrial applications that require the safety and quality in moving material provided by our superior design and engineering know-how.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	We developed our leading market position over our 143 -year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior after-sale service.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Ongoing initiatives to increase earnings power include operational excellence and profitable growth.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	In accordance with Blueprint 2021, we are simplifying the business structure and product platforms, improving operating performance, and focusing our R D expenditures to grow profitably.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	Shareholder value will be enhanced by expanding EBITDA margins and return on invested capital (ROIC).
1005229_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 31, 2017 we completed our acquisition of STAHL.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	STAHL is a leading manufacturer of explosion-protected hoists and crane components and is well known for providing lifting solutions utilizing its custom engineering and hoisting technology.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including oil and gas, automotive, general manufacturing, steel concrete, power generation as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	We believe STAHL is an excellent expansion of our global product offering.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	STAHL's strong position with wire rope and electric chain hoists in Europe immediately complements our leadership position in handheld hoists in that region, and their broad portfolio of ATEX certified explosion-protected products serving the oil and gas, mining, and chemical processing industries significantly extends our global offerings in capability and capacities.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 47% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our expansion within the European market with the acquisition of STAHL further expands our geographic diversity.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies, as well as benefit the Company from growth in emerging markets.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as indicators of anticipated demand for our products.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including industrial production, energy costs, steel price fluctuations, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	From a strategic perspective, we are leveraging our recent acquisitions and investing in new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting, and sling chain, forged attachments, actuators, and digital power and motion control systems for the material handling industry.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including general industrial, energy, automotive, heavy OEM, entertainment, and construction and infrastructure.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction, reduced defects, shortened lead times, improved inventory turns and on-time deliveries, reduced warranty costs, and improved working capital utilization.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The initiatives are being driven by the implementation of our operating system E-PAS .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	We are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification, the creation of centers of excellence, and improved supply chain management.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	We are also pursuing cost reduction opportunities to enhance future margins.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We continuously monitor market prices of steel.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	We purchase approximately $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod, wire, bar, structural, and other forms of steel.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increasing productivity of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	While we execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our solid free cash flow as well as our liquidity position and flexible debt structure.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Fiscal 2018 sales were $839,419,000 , an increase of 31.8% , or $ 202,296,000 compared with fiscal 2017 sales of $637,123,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Sales for the year were positively impacted by $144,670,000 due to our acquisition of STAHL, $40,993,000 due to an increase in sales volume, and $2,529,000 by price increases.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Favorable foreign currency translation increased sales by $14,104,000.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our gross profit was $284,574,000 and $192,932,000 or 33.9% and 30.3% of net sales in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The fiscal 2018 increase in gross profit of $91,642,000 or 47.5% is the result of $53,794,000 from the acquisition of STAHL, $4,828,000 in increased productivity and favorable manufacturing costs, $1,361,000 of price increases net of material inflation, $13,227,000 in increased volume, $2,964,000 in decreased product liability costs, $8,852,000 in STAHL inventory amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments incurred in fiscal 2017 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2018, a $2,362,000 increase due to an insurance settlement, offset by $307,000 in STAHL integration costs that are classified as cost of products sold.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	The translation of foreign currencies had a $4,561,000 favorable impact on gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling expenses were $101,956,000 and $77,319,000 , or 12.1% of net sales in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	STAHL contributed an additional $18,396,000 in selling expense and $616,000 of integration costs were incurred related to the acquisition of STAHL that are classified as selling expense, offset by $247,000 in expense that did not reoccur related to the Canadian lump sum pension settlement in the year ended March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The remainder of the increase is largely due to the increase in sales volume, additional marketing expenses, and the transition to a new warehouse in North America.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Additionally, foreign currency translation had a $2,151,000 unfavorable impact on selling expenses.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	General and administrative expenses were $83,350,000 and $69,928,000 or 9.9% and 11.0% of net sales in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The fiscal 2018 increase was primarily the result of the STAHL acquisition which added $9,477,000 in recurring general and administrated expenses and $7,840,000 of integration costs were incurred related to the acquisition of STAHL that are classified as general and administrative expense, offset by $8,815,000 in STAHL related acquisition and integration costs incurred in the year ended March 31, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	Additionally, $1,589,000 in net legal costs were incurred for a legal action against our product liability insurance carriers, $400,000 in expected litigation costs for a former subsidiary of Magnetek, $619,000 in debt repricing fees, offset by CEO retirement and search costs of $3,085,000 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	The remainder of the increase is largely due to higher annual incentive plan costs expected in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $1,178,000 unfavorable impact on general and administrative expenses.

1005229_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	The annual interest rate was 4.35% with an original maturity date of February 24, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	The term of the loan was extended through a loan amendment with a new maturity date of May 24, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	Therefore, this loan was classified in current portion of long-term debt at March 31, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	The Company repaid the loan in full in fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The gross balance of deferred financing costs on the term loan was $14,690,000 as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 .

1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	(a) As described in Note 11 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	(b) As described in Note 17 to consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	(c) We have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	We estimate that, at any given point in time, our cancelable open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate $54 million.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S4	(d) Estimated for our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility and interest rate swaps as described in Note 9 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S5	Calculated using a Eurocurrency rate of 2.30% plus an applicable margin of 2.50%.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S6	(e) For additional details, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P72_S7	Excludes uncertain tax positions of $0.1 million shown separately above.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing, and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, and enhance safety.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $14,515,000 , $14,368,000 , and 22,320,000 respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	Excluded from fiscal 2018 capital expenditures is $0 , $0 , and $1,638,000 in property, plant and equipment purchases included in accounts payable at March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2019 to range between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000, excluding acquisitions and strategic alliances.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Asia-Pacific.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance and workers compensation insurance have exceeded general inflation levels.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	We believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges, and other costs attributable to plan closures as well as divestitures and acquisitions.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P79_S4	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	Those assumptions are disclosed in Note 12 to our fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	Changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	Further, actual experience can differ from the assumptions and these differences are typically accounted for as actuarial gains or losses that are amortized over future periods.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The weighted average pension discount rate assumptions of 3.49% , 3.65% , and 4.30% , as of March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, are based on long-term AA rated corporate and municipal bond rates.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	The weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions of 6.77% , 7.23% , and 7.22% for the years ended March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, is based on the targeted plan asset allocation which follows a sliding risk scale based on funding levels (approximately 46% - 42% equities and 54% - 58% fixed income) and their long-term historical returns.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Our under-funded status for all pension plans as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $135,539,000 and $150,431,000 , or 29.3% and 31.9% of the projected benefit obligation, respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	Our pension contributions during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were approximately $11,211,000 and $6,140,000 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	The under-funded status may result in future pension expense increases.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Pension expense (benefit) for the March 31, 2019 fiscal year is expected to approximate a benefit of ($602,000), compared to fiscal 2018 expense of $690,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The benefit expected in fiscal 2019 is the result of amendments to two of the Company's U.S pension plans which froze benefits.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	Pension funding contributions for the March 31, 2019 fiscal year are expected to approximate $11,353,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	The weighted-average compensation increase assumption of 0.39% , 0.39% , and 0.44% as of March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	The healthcare costs inflation assumptions of 6.3% , 6.5%, and 6.8% for fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, are based on anticipated trends.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	While the healthcare inflation rate assumptions have been decreasing, healthcare costs continue to outpace inflation in the U.S.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 15 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses, and increased limit factors.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P85_S3	Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our goodwill balance of $347,434,000 as of March 31, 2018 is subject to impairment testing.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, or in circumstances where the components share assets or other resources and have other economic interdependencies).
1005229_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	Duff-Norton and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $9,721,000 , and $337,713,000 , respectively, at March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy, and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	We also proceed to the quantitative model when economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2018 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	Accordingly, we did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units during fiscal 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	We further test our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance of $48,874,000 consisting of trademarks on our recent acquisitions on an annual basis for impairment.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Similar to goodwill, we first assess various qualitative factors in the analysis.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2018 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than that its applicable carrying value, other than Magnetek's indefinite-lived trademark.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	We proceeded to the quantitative test for this intangible asset.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The methodology used to value the Magnetek indefinite-lived trademark is the relief from royalty method.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	If the recorded book value of the trademark is in excess of the calculated fair value, an impairment is indicated.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The key estimate used in this calculation consists of an overall royalty rate applied to the sales covered by the trademark.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	After performing the analysis, it was determined that the fair value of the Magnetek indefinite-lived trademark exceeded its carrying value, and as such, no other impairment was recorded.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Purchase Price Allocations for Business Combinations.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , we completed a business combination for a total purchase price of $248,246,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Under purchase accounting, we recorded assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	We identified and assigned value to trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, favorable supply agreements, backlog, and technology.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	We estimated the useful lives over which these intangible assets would be amortized.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	Valuations of these assets were performed largely using discounted cash flow models and estimates of replacement cost.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	These valuations support the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets had a value of $143,039,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P95_S5	The resulting goodwill was $150,386,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Assigning value to intangible assets requires estimates used in projecting relevant future cash flows and estimates of replacement costs, in addition to estimating useful lives of such assets.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write-offs and credit memos issued, assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts, and analyzing the accounts receivable aging.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	At March 31, 2018 the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $3,520,000.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Impairment of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets .
1005229_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The following summarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment (amounts in millions):
1005229_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	On a quarterly basis, we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	We generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Information regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this March 31, 2018 10-K report.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	This report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements, including general economic and business conditions, conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries, conditions affecting our customers and suppliers, competitor responses to our products and services, the overall market acceptance of such products and services, facility consolidations and other restructurings, our asbestos-related liability, the integration of acquisitions, and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	Consequently such forward-looking statements should be regarded as our current plans, estimates and beliefs.
1005229_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity prices for raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in interest rates.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We may enter into financial instrument transactions, which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In fiscal 2018 , 47% of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico, and France and sell our products in approximately 50 countries.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	With our fiscal year 2017 acquisition of STAHL, we have an increased presence in the United Arab Emirates, with total assets of approximately $15,200,000.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, European currencies, the South African Rand, the Mexican Peso, the Brazilian Real, and the Chinese Yuan.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P2_S5	For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro, the value of our net sales and net income denominated in Euros increases when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,000,000 on our income from operations.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In addition, the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has cross currency swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge changes in the value of intercompany loans to a foreign subsidiary due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	This intercompany loan is related to the acquisition of STAHL.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The notional amount of these derivatives is $215,130,000, and all of the contracts mature by January 31, 2022.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	From its March 31, 2018 balance of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss), or AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $132,000 out of AOCL, and into foreign currency exchange loss (gain), during the next 12 months based on the contractual payments due under these intercompany loans.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to offset changes in the value of other intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P4_S5	The notional amount of these derivatives is $3,500,000 and all of the contracts mature by June 30, 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The notional amount of those derivatives is $13,474,000 and all contracts mature by March 31, 2019.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	From its March 31, 2018 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $10,000 out of AOCL during the next 12 months based on the underlying transactions of the sales of the goods purchased.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The Company's policy is to maintain a capital structure that is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements in which the Company receives interest at a variable rate and pays interest at a fixed rate.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge changes in interest expense due to changes in the variable interest rate of the senior secured term loan.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The amortizing interest rate swaps mature by December 31, 2023 and have a total notional amount of $229,830,000 as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The effective portion of the changes in fair values of the interest rate swaps is reported in AOCL and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the swap agreements.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The ineffective portion was not material and was recognized in the current period interest expense.
1005229_18_ITEM7A_P8_S5	From its March 31, 2018 balance of AOCL, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $503,000 out of AOCL, and into interest expense, during the next 12 months.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated May 30, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P4_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since at least 1917, but we are unable to determine the specific year.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and other material handling products, which efficiently and safely move, lift, position, and secure materials.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Key products include hoists, rigging tools, cranes, actuators, digital power control and delivery systems, and elevator application drive systems.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	On January 31, 2017, the Company acquired STAHL CraneSystems ( STAHL ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P6_S3	STAHL is a leading manufacturer of explosion-protected hoists and crane components specializing in custom engineering of lifting solutions and hoisting technology.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P6_S4	STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil gas, steel concrete, power generation as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Company s material handling products are sold globally, principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	During fiscal 2018 , approximately 53% of sales were to customers in the United States.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Advertising expenses were $2,683,000 , $1,748,000 , and $1,690,000 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	Approximately 10% of the Company s employees are represented by three separate U.S. collective bargaining agreements which expire May 2020 , April 2021, and September 2021.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its global subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company has an investment in Eastern Morris Cranes Company Limited (EMC) whose principal activity is to manufacture various electrical overhead traveling cranes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	This investment represents a minority ownership interest that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the Company has significant influence over the investee.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	As a result, the Company records its portion of the gains and losses incurred by this entity in Investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Under this method, all items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates during the year.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P13_S3	Gains or losses on translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in foreign currency exchange loss (gain).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	There were net losses, including changes in the fair value of derivatives, on foreign currency transactions of approximately $1,539,000 , $1,232,000 , and $2,215,000 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P15_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the reporting segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company s one segment is subdivided into four reporting units.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Further, as discussed in Note 21, in January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (Topic 350)," which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value amount as part of step two of the goodwill test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Therefore, an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value is greater than the reporting unit's fair value (step one).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	When the Company evaluates the potential for goodwill impairment, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, the Company performs a quantitative test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	To perform the quantitative impairment test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate, and the discount rate.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company projects revenue growth rates, operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business, expected developments and operational strategies over a five-year period.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	In estimating the terminal growth rate, the Company considers its historical and projected results, as well as the economic environment in which its reporting units operate.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	The discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect the Company s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions, both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2018 and determined that the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required for both the Rest of Products reporting unit and the Duff-Norton reporting unit.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Based on various conditions in the current fiscal year, such as the Company's financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, and other company specific events, the Rest of Products and Duff Norton reporting units' fair value was likely not less than its applicable carrying value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	See Note 8 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company assesses impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	This statement requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over its remaining useful life.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	The fair values are determined in accordance with ASC 820.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management considered the Company s product line portfolio, customers and related commercial agreements, labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company considers projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends and other factors in its assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as future production volumes, customer pricing, economics, and productivity and cost initiatives, could significantly affect its estimates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	In determining fair value of long-lived assets, management uses management estimates, discounted cash flow calculations, and appraisals where necessary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	No impairment was recorded related to long-lived assets in the current year.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets which primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships, and technology.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The fair values are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Such valuations may include a discounted cash flow of anticipated revenues resulting from the acquired intangible asset.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The straight line method is used for customer relationships.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	As a result of the negligible attrition rate in our customer base, the difference between the straight line method and attrition method is not considered significant.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The estimated useful lives for our intangible assets range from 1 to 25 years.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Similar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets (including trademarks on our acquisitions) are tested for impairment on an annual basis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	When the Company evaluates the potential for impairment of intangible assets, it assesses a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for its products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, the Company performs a new quantitative test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	The methodology used to value trademarks is the relief from royalty method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The recorded book value of these trademarks in excess of the calculated fair value triggers an impairment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	The key estimate used in this calculation consists of an overall royalty rate applied to the sales covered by the trademark.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	After performing this analysis, it was determined that the fair value of trademarks exceeded their book values, and as such, no impairment was recorded.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Cost of approximately 30% and 29% of inventories at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 , respectively, have been determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Costs of other inventories have been determined using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) or average cost method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Costs in inventory include components for direct labor and overhead costs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity and fixed income securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	In such instance, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives (buildings and building equipment 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 18 years).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Included within other assets is a building that is held for sale in the amount of $425,000 at March 31, 2018 and 2017 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	The building was closed as part of the Company's fiscal 2010 restructuring activities.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	During the year ended March 31, 2018 the Company did not change the assets held for sale value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	For its fiscal 2018 financial statements, the Company has reclassified research and development (R D) expenses previously recorded in general and administrative expense into a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	All periods presented have been revised to reflect this presentation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	With the acquisitions of Magnetek in September 2015 and STAHL CraneSystems ( STAHL ) in January 2017, the Company expects R D costs to factor more prominently in our cost structure.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Therefore, the new presentation of R D costs provides transparency into these costs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Consistent with prior periods, the Company continues to account for R D expenses in accordance with the provisions of ASC 730 and are expensed as incurred.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at time of shipment to the customer.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S4	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other factors.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P43_S5	Accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return product.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	Sales tax is excluded from revenue.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company offers warranties for certain products it sells.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective for a period of one year, and for certain products, a lifetime warranty.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Changes in the Company s product warranty accrual are as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	On July 15, 2016, the Company purchased 100% of the assets of Ergomatic Products LLC ("Ergomatic"), a designer and manufacturer of ergonomic lift assists, articulating arms, torque tubes, and pneumatic control systems for material handling and tool suspension applications.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The purchase price of the transaction was $1,175,000 , of which $587,000 was paid to the seller on the day of closing with the remainder due to the seller over a two year period.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Ergomatic, the Company withheld $588,000 to be paid to the seller upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	Of this amount, $294,000 was paid to the se ller in July 2017 and the remaining $294,000 is expected to be paid in July 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company has recorded short term restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheets of $294,000 within prepaid expenses and a short term liability of $294,000 within accrued liabilities at March 31, 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of Ergomatic is now complete as the measurement period has closed.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily includes engineered drawings of $677,000 with an estimated useful life of 20 years.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The assignment of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	On January 31, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of STAHL for $217,773,000 , net of cash acquired.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The results of STAHL included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition are net sales and income (loss) from operations of $24,682,000 and ($6,022,000) , respectively for the year ended March 31, 2017 and $173,166,000 and $18,553,000 , respectively for the year ended March 31, 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	2017 includes acquisition-related inventory amortization of $8,852,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	These costs have been included in cost of goods sold.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	Acquisition expenses incurred by the Company total $8,454,000 and were all incurred in fiscal 2017 and have been recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	Additionally, in fiscal 2018 the Company incurred $8,763,000 in STAHL integration costs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	To finance the STAHL acquisition, the Company, completed securing a $545,000,000 debt facility (New Facilities) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan Chase Bank).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The New Facilities consist of a New Revolving Facility in the amount of $100,000,000 and a $445,000,000 1st Lien Term Loan.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	Proceeds from the New Facility were used to fund the STAHL acquisition, pay fees and expenses associated with the acquisition, and refinance the Company s existing Term Loan and Credit Facility.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P61_S3	During fiscal 2018 and 2017 the Company had not drawn on the New Revolving Facility and had repaid $57,037,000 and $12,500,000 , respectively on the 1st Lien Term Loan.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P61_S4	Please refer to Note 11 for additional information related to the Company's debt facilities.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The sale of the shares closed on January 30, 2017 at a price per Common Share of $22.00 , generating gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The purchase agreement for the shares required the Company to file an initial registration statement registering the common shares issued to the purchasers for resale.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The filing of the registration statement was completed and declared effective on April 28, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of STAHL is now complete as the measurement period has closed.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The excess consideration of $150,386,000 recorded as goodwill reflects an increase of $64,000 from that which was recorded as of March 31, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	The increase is due to an adjustment to the amount allocated to STAHL's other assets and other liabilities offset by a decrease due to a payment received in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior owner of STAHL as a result of a working capital true up.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include customer relationships of $120,220,000 , trademark and trade names of $18,191,000 , patents and technology of $2,660,000 , and other intangibles totaling $1,968,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The weighted average life of the acquired identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization was estimated at 16 years at the time of acquisition.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The assignment of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	For each of the Company's acquisitions disclosed, goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that do not meet the criteria for separate recognition apart from goodwill, including assembled workforce, growth opportunities, and increased presence in the markets served by the acquired companies.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Included within accrued liabilities at March 31, 2017 is $14,103,000 due to the former owner of STAHL related to a profit distribution agreement in place prior to the acquisition.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	This was paid to the former owner during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	See Note 4 for assumptions used in determining the fair values of of the intangible assets acquired.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations as if the acquisitions had occurred as of April 1, 2016.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	The pro forma information includes certain adjustments, including depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and certain other adjustments, together with related income tax effects.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	The pro forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions occurred as of April 1, 2016 and are not necessarily indicative of future results of the combined companies (in thousands, except per share data):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the standards for reporting financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Under these standards, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	ASC Topic 820-10-35-37 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the valuation techniques that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	The hierarchy is separated into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, involving some degree of judgment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	The availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset/liability, whether the asset/liability is established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are required to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company primarily uses readily observable market data in conjunction with internally developed discounted cash flow valuation models when valuing its derivative portfolio and, consequently, the fair value of the Company s derivatives is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The carrying amount of the Company's annuity contract is recorded at net asset value of the contract and, consequently, its fair value is based on Level 2 inputs and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company uses quoted prices in an inactive market when valuing its term loan and, consequently, the fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	The carrying value of the Company s senior debt approximates fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, its fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table provides information regarding financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company did not have any non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	At March 31, 2018 , the term loan, revolving credit facility, and senior debt have been recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are recorded in investment (income) loss.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in foreign currency exchange (gain) loss or other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that the derivative qualifies as a hedge under the provisions of ASC Topic 815.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Interest and dividend income on marketable securities are measured based upon amounts earned on their respective declaration dates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	During fiscal 2018, the Company terminated certain employees in connection with its overall STAHL integration plan.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The Company incurred $4,163,000 in severance and other employee termination costs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The costs incurred were calculated at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs which included expected payments.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P87_S3	Of this, $1,809,000 is unpaid and included within accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	During fiscal 2018 the Company performed a qualitative analysis of the fair value of its Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units for its goodwill impairment testing.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The qualitative analysis did not require the use of non-recurring fair value measurements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	A similar qualitative analysis was also performed for the Company's STAHL and Unified Industries indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company performed a quantitative analysis to evaluate whether the indefinite-lived intangible assets of Magnetek were impaired.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	In performing this analysis, a royalty rate of 2.7% and a discount rate of 10.0% was used.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2017 include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of STAHL and Ergomatic described in Note 3.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	The estimated fair values allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed relied upon fair value measurements based primarily on Level 3 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	The valuation techniques used to allocate fair values to working capital items; property, plant, and equipment; and identifiable intangible assets included the cost approach, market approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	For identifiable intangible assets these techniques included the excess earnings approach, cost approach, relief from royalty approach, and other income approaches.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The valuation techniques relied on a number of inputs which included the cost and condition of property, plant, and equipment and forecasted net sales and income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	For Ergomatic, the most significant valuation inputs included an engineering cost per hour of $40.86 for engineered drawings.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	For STAHL significant valuation inputs included an attrition rate of 10.0% for customer relationships, an estimated useful life of 15 years and royalty rate of 2.0% for developed technology, a royalty rate of 1.0% for trademark and trade names, and a weighted average cost of capital of 10.5% .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Additional assets and liabilities that were measured on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2017 include the net assets of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	These measurements have been used to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis under the provisions of ASC Topic 350-20-35-1 Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Goodwill Subsequent Measurement.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The fiscal 2017 Step 1 goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value of the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units on a quantitative basis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	The fair value for the Company s Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 inputs or Level 2 inputs that are observable in active markets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P94_S2	Therefore, the Company used a blended discounted cash flow and market-based valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, using Level 3 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	To estimate the fair value of the Rest of Products and Duff-Norton reporting units, the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	For Rest of Products the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 3.2% .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.0% after five years.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P96_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting unit was determined to be 10.0% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	For the Duff-Norton reporting unit the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of the projections was approximately 3.9% .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	The terminal value was calculated assuming a projected growth rate of 3.5% after five years.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	The estimated weighted-average cost of capital for the reporting units was determined to be 10.2% based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix, their related volatility, and the size of their market capitalization.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company also measured indefinite-lived intangible assets from the Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries acquisitions on a non-recurring basis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The fair value measurements were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	In performing these analyses, royalty rates of 2.5% , 0.3% , and 1.3% were used for the indefinitely-lived intangible assets of Magnetek, STB, and Unified Industries, respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P98_S3	A discount rate of 11.4% was used for each analysis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	After performing the valuation above, the Company determined that the indefinite-lived STB intangible trademark asset was fully impaired in fiscal 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The impairment was due to lower cash flows and royalty rates than at the time of the acquisition.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The total impairment loss of $1,125,000 was recorded within intangible asset impairment on the Company's statement of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	See Note 8 for additional discussion on the Company's goodwill impairment assessment and the conclusions reached.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	There were LIFO liquidations resulting in $547,000 and $384,000 of additional income in fiscal 2017 and 2016 income, respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	LIFO liquidations were not material during fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities, which consist of equity securities and fixed income securities, have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet unless unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	In such instances, the unrealized losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Interest and dividend income are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	Marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are held for the settlement of the Company s general and products liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc. (CMIC), a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	The marketable securities are not available for general working capital purposes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-30 Investments Debt Equity Securities Subsequent Measurement, the Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other-than-temporary.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	The Company generally considers market value declines to be other-than-temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of 20% of original cost, or when other evidence indicates impairment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	We also consider the nature of the underlying investments, our intent and ability to hold the investments until their market values recover, and other market conditions in making this assessment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P107_S3	Based on this assessment, no other-than-temporary impairment charge has been recorded during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , or 2016 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	During fiscal 2017, CMIC obtained approval from the New York State Department of Finance Services to loan up to $10,000,000 to the Company based on arms-length terms and conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	CMIC initially loaned $6,000,000 to the Company during fiscal 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	To fund this intercompany loan, CMIC sold a portion of its marketable security portfolio with a cost of $5,938,000 and a fair value of $6,000,000 resulting in a realized gain of $62,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P108_S3	During fiscal 2018 the loan was increased to $10,000,000 to settle intercompany payables due to CMIC.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2018 (In thousands):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	The aggregate fair value of investments and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2018 are as follows (In thousands):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company considered the nature of the investments, causes of previous impairments, the severity and duration of unrealized losses, and other factors and determined that the unrealized losses at March 31, 2018 were temporary in nature.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	Net realized gains and losses related to sales of marketable securities are included in investment (income) loss in the consolidated statements of operations.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P122_S3	The Company s reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities and interdependencies between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P122_S4	The Company s reporting units identified under ASC Topic 350-20-35-33 are at the component level, or one level below the operating segment level as defined under ASC Topic 280-10-50-10 Segment Reporting Disclosure.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or if economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2018 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than their applicable carrying value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	Accordingly, we did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units during fiscal 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-30-35, indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Similar to goodwill, we first assess various qualitative factors in the analysis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2018 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than that its applicable carrying value, other than Magnetek's indefinite-lived trademark.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P126_S3	We proceeded to the quantitative test for this intangible asset.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The methodology used to value the Magnetek indefinite-lived trademark is the relief from royalty method.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P127_S1	If the recorded book value of the trademark is in excess of the calculated fair value, an impairment is indicated.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The key estimate used in this calculation consists of an overall royalty rate applied to the sales covered by the trademark.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	After performing the analysis, it was determined that the fair value of the Magnetek indefinite-lived trademark exceeded its carrying value, and as such, no impairment was recorded.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Magnetek, the Company agreed to continue the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan of Magnetek, Inc. (the "Magnetek Stock Plan").
1005229_18_ITEM8_P225_S1	In doing so, the Company has available under the Magnetek Stock Plan 164,461 of the Company's shares which can be granted to certain employees as stock based compensation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintained two stock option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan ("Non-Qualified Plan") and an Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Incentive Plan").
1005229_18_ITEM8_P226_S1	Effective with adoption of the LTIP no new grants can be made from the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	Options outstanding under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan generally become exercisable over a four -year period at a rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the date of grant and exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P227_S1	Options granted under the Non-Qualified Plan or the Incentive Stock Plan are exercisable not earlier than one year and not later than ten years from the date such option was granted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	A summary of option transactions during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2018 is as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P229_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2018 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 922,450 options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P229_S2	The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of March 31, 2018 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the 306,218 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P229_S3	The Company's closing stock price was $35.84 as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P229_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $5,851,000 , $252,000 , and $81,000 during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P230_S0	The grant date fair value of options that vested was $7.42 , $8.56 , and $8.85 during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during fiscal 2018 and 2017 was approximately $6,332,000 and $439,000 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P233_S0	As of March 31, 2018 , $2,515,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P234_S1	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding at March 31, 2018 :
1005229_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options exercisable at March 31, 2018 :
1005229_18_ITEM8_P236_S0	The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P237_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P237_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P237_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P237_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options was $7.66 , $5.59 , and $8.58 for options granted during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P237_S4	The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to value stock options granted during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 :
1005229_18_ITEM8_P238_S0	To determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on daily closing prices of its Common Stock over periods that correlate with the expected terms of the options granted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P238_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the options granted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P239_S0	Expected dividends are based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P239_S1	The expected term of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company granted restricted stock units under the LTIP during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 to employees as well as to the Company s non-executive directors as part of their annual compensation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P240_S1	Restricted stock units for employees prior to fiscal 2018 vest ratably based on service one-third after each of years three, four, and five.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P240_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2018 restricted stock units for employees vest ratably based on service one-quarter after each of years one, two, three, and four.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P241_S0	A summary of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company s LTIP plan as of March 31, 2018 is as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P242_S0	Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of March 31, 2018 is $4,994,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P242_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3,210,000 and $3,238,000 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Company granted performance shares under the LTIP during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P243_S1	Performance shares granted are based upon the Company s Consolidated Net Revenue for the two year period ended March 31, 2018 , March 31, 2017 , and March 31, 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P243_S2	Fiscal year 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 performance based nonvested shares are recognized as compensation expense based upon their grant date fair value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P243_S3	This expense is recognized ratably over the three year period that these shares are restricted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P243_S4	During fiscal 2017, the Company determined that the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 performance shares would not vest due to the performance condition not being met.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P246_S1	The weighted average fair value grant price of those shares was $25.80 , $15.74 , and $22.70 for fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P246_S2	The expense related to the shares for fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $430,000 for each of the three years.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P249_S0	From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P249_S2	The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation will have a material impact on its business.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P250_S0	Accrued general and product liability costs are actuarially estimated reserves based on amounts determined from loss reports, individual cases filed with the Company, and an amount for losses incurred but not reported.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P250_S1	The aggregate amounts of reserves were $13,582,000 and $13,335,000 of which $10,082,000 and $9,835,000 are included in Other non current liabilities and $3,500,000 in Accrued liabilities for both years as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P251_S0	The liability for accrued general and product liability costs are funded by investments in marketable securities (see Notes 2 and 6).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P252_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for accrued general and product liability:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P253_S0	The per occurrence limits on the self-insurance for general and product liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon through its wholly-owned captive insurance company were $2,000,000 from inception through fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P253_S1	In addition to the per occurrence limits, the Company s coverage is also subject to an annual aggregate limit, applicable to losses only.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P253_S2	These limits range from $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P254_S0	Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P254_S1	To address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an environmental auditing program for its facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P254_S2	The Company has also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of its business.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P254_S3	Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory compliance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P254_S4	However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for fiscal 2019.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P255_S0	Like many industrial manufacturers, the Company is involved in asbestos-related litigation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P255_S1	In continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of years such activity might continue.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P255_S2	Based on this review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related personal injury claims.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P255_S3	This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P255_S4	The Company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S0	Based on actuarial information, the Company has estimated its asbestos-related aggregate liability including related legal costs to range between $4,000,000 and $7,700,000 using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of 37 years from March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S1	The Company's estimation of its asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $6,235,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S2	The recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S3	This liability will fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S4	Of this amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $2,000,000 over the next 12 months.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P256_S5	Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S0	The Company believes that a share of its previously incurred asbestos-related expenses and future asbestos-related expenses are covered by pre-existing insurance policies.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S1	The Company has engaged in a legal action against the insurance carriers for those policies to recover these expenses and future costs incurred.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S2	When the Company resolves this legal action, it is expected that a gain will be recorded for previously expensed cost that is recovered.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S3	In July 2017, the Company received a $1,741,000 settlement payment, net of legal fees, from one of its insurance carriers as partial reimbursement for asbestos-related expenses.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S4	This partial payment has been recorded as a gain in cost of products sold.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S5	In February 2018, an additional settlement payment of $621,000 was received from another insurance carrier as partial reimbursement for asbestos-related expenses.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P257_S6	The Company is continuing its actions to recover further past costs and to cover future costs.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P258_S0	The Company is also involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P258_S1	The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P259_S0	The Company's estimation of its product-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates $6,273,000 , which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P260_S0	In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P261_S0	Management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P262_S0	The following loss contingencies relate to the Company's Magnetek subsidiary:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P263_S0	Product Liability Magnetek has been named, along with multiple other defendants, in asbestos-related lawsuits associated with business operations previously acquired but which are no longer owned.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P263_S1	During Magnetek's ownership, none of the businesses produced or sold asbestos-containing products.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P263_S2	For such claims, Magnetek is uninsured and either contractually indemnified against liability, or contractually obligated to defend and indemnify the purchaser of these former business operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P263_S3	The Company aggressively seeks dismissal from these proceedings.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P263_S4	Based on actuarial information, the asbestos related liability including legal costs is estimated to be approximately $1,074,000 which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P264_S0	Litigation-Other In October 2010, Magnetek received a request for indemnification from Power-One, Inc. ("Power-One") for an Italian tax matter arising out of the sale of Magnetek's power electronics business to Power-One in October 2006.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P264_S1	With a reservation of rights, Magnetek affirmed its obligation to indemnify Power-One for certain pre-closing taxes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P264_S2	The sale included an Italian company, Magnetek, S.p.A., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Magnetek Electronics (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd. (the Power-One China Subsidiary ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P265_S0	The tax authority in Arezzo, Italy, issued a notice of audit report in September 2010 wherein it asserted that the Power-One China Subsidiary had its administrative headquarters in Italy with fiscal residence in Italy and, therefore, is subject to taxation in Italy.

1005229_18_ITEM8_P272_S0	Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P272_S1	Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P272_S2	Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties, and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P273_S0	In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation ( Universal ) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom ( FOL ), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P273_S1	Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P274_S0	Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P275_S0	FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P275_S1	Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P275_S2	In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P275_S3	Magnetek further believes that FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P276_S0	In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P276_S1	DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P276_S2	Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P277_S0	The Company has recorded a liability of $283,000 , included in the amount specified above, related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P278_S0	FOL's inability to satisfy its remaining obligations to the state of Connecticut related to the Bridgeport facility and any offsite disposal locations, or the discovery of additional environmental contamination at the Bridgeport facility is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P279_S0	In September of 2017, Magnetek received a request for defense and indemnification from Monsanto Company, Pharmacia, LLC, and Solutia, Inc. (collectively, Monsanto ) with respect to: (1) lawsuits brought by plaintiffs claiming that Monsanto manufactured polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), exposure to which allegedly caused injury to plaintiffs; (2) lawsuits brought by municipalities and municipal entities claiming that Monsanto should be responsible for a variety of damages due to the presence of PCBs in bodies of water in those municipalities and/or in water treated by those municipal entities.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P280_S0	Monsanto claims to be entitled to defense and indemnification from Magnetek under a so-called Special Undertaking apparently executed by Universal in January of 1972, which purportedly required Universal to defend and indemnify Monsanto from liabilities arising out of or in connection with the receipt, purchase, possession, handling, use, sale or disposition of PCBs by Universal.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P281_S0	Magnetek has declined Monsanto s tender, and believes that it has meritorious legal and factual defenses to the demands made by Monsanto.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P281_S1	Magnetek is vigorously defending against those demands and has commenced litigation to, among other things, declare the Special Undertaking void and unenforceable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P281_S2	Monsanto has, in turn, commenced an action to enforce the Special Undertaking.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P281_S3	Magnetek intends to continue to vigorously prosecute its declaratory judgment action and to defend against Monsanto s action against it.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P281_S4	As of March 31, 2018 the Company has recorded $400,000 for legal costs incurred to date and expected to be incurred related to this matter.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P282_S0	We cannot reasonably estimate a potential range of loss with respect to Monsanto s tender because there is insufficient information regarding the underlying matters.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P282_S1	Management believes, however, that the potential additional costs related to such matters, if any, will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P283_S0	The Company has recorded total liabilities of $804,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018 on an undiscounted basis.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P284_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation (the Act), which among other matters reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P284_S1	As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, under the Act, the Company revalued its ending U.S. net deferred tax assets and recognized a provisional $16,102,000 tax expense in the Company s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S0	The Act implements a territorial tax system and imposes a one-time transition tax based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E P) that it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S1	The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability for its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $1,500,000 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S2	The Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E P for these foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S3	Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S4	This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S5	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S6	Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S7	The Company originally recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of $2,500,000 recorded at December 31, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P285_S8	Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Act and refinement of our calculations for these foreign subsidiaries during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we decreased that provisional amount by $1,000,000 , which is included as a component of income tax expense.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P286_S0	On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P286_S1	The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the one-time transition tax, withholding tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P286_S2	Our preliminary estimate of the one-time transition tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the Act, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of our tax returns.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P286_S3	U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P287_S0	The final determination of the one-time transition tax and the re-measurement of our deferred assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the enactment of the Act.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P288_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P288_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences were as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P289_S0	(1) For fiscal 2018, represents the blended rate of 35 percent for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and 21 percent for the fourth quarter.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P289_S1	(2) Represents the discrete expense of the one-time transition tax ( $1,500,000 ) and the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax assets at the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate ( $16,102,000 ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P290_S0	The provision for income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P291_S0	The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P291_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P292_S0	The net deferred tax asset decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the revaluation of the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower U.S. federal tax rate provided in the Act, discussed above.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P293_S0	The gross amount of the Company s deferred tax assets were $81,846,000 and $125,612,000 at March 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P294_S0	The valuation allowance includes $3,837,000 , $4,370,000 , and $3,426,000 related to foreign net operating losses at March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P294_S1	The decrease in the foreign valuation allowance is primarily due to the use of net operating losses which had valuation allowances recorded against them for certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P294_S2	The Company s foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that expire in periods ranging from five years to indefinite.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P295_S0	The federal net operating losses arose from the acquisition of Magnetek and have expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2035.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P295_S1	The state net operating losses have expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2038.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P295_S2	The federal tax credits have expiration dates ranging from 2036 to indefinite.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P296_S0	Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets based on the following breakdown:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P297_S0	Net non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P298_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax expense includes foreign subsidiary income of $25,144,000 , $3,071,000 , and $5,448,000 for the years ended March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P298_S1	As of March 31, 2018 , the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to approximately $120,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P298_S2	These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. with the exception of the current earnings from two foreign subsidiaries.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P298_S3	Any repatriation of these amounts would not be expected to result in a material increase to income tax expense.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P298_S4	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P299_S0	During fiscal 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P299_S1	There were shares of common stock issued through restricted stock units, the exercise of non-qualified stock options, or through the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P299_S2	The tax effect to the Company from these share transactions during fiscal 2018 was a (reduction to) income tax expense of ( $1,230,000 ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P299_S3	Prior to the adoption of this ASU, in fiscal 2017 the tax effect to the Company from these transactions, recorded in additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as a (reduction to) income tax expense, was $(197,000) .
1005229_18_ITEM8_P300_S0	Changes in the Company s uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, are as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P301_S0	The Company had $33,000 and $21,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at March 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P301_S1	The Company recognizes interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P302_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2018 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P303_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P303_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed an examination of the Company s U.S. income tax returns for fiscal 2015 resulting in no adjustments.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P303_S2	The Company has no current U.S. income tax examinations or audits.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P304_S0	The Company s major tax jurisdictions are the United States and Germany.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P304_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to March 31, 2015 and in Germany for tax years prior to March 31, 2011.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P304_S2	The Company has a current tax examination in Germany for fiscal years 2012 to 2014.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P305_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly due to the settlement of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitation prior to March 31, 2019.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P306_S0	Rental expense for the years ended March 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $13,020,000 , $9,216,000 , and $7,532,000 , respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P306_S1	The fiscal 2018 increase is largely due to the transition to and rental of a new warehouse in North America.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P306_S2	The following amounts represent future minimum payment commitments as of March 31, 2018 under non-cancelable operating leases extending beyond one year:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P307_S0	ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P307_S1	The Company has one operating and reportable segment for both internal and external reporting purposes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P308_S0	Financial information relating to the Company s operations by geographic area is as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P309_S0	Note: Net sales to external customers are attributed to geographic areas based upon the location from which the product was shipped from the Company to the customer.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P310_S0	Note: Long-lived assets include net property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles, net.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P311_S0	Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2018 and 2017 :
1005229_18_ITEM8_P312_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:
1005229_18_ITEM8_P313_S0	The deferred taxes related to the adjustments associated with the items included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, were $(6,848,000) , $(5,579,000) , and $4,753,000 for fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 respectively.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P313_S1	Refer to Note 16 for discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P313_S2	In the period subsequent to our initial recording of the valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, increases and decreases to both the deferred tax assets associated with items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the valuation allowance, have been recorded as offsets to comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P314_S0	As a result of the Act as described in Note 16, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a ( $9,477,000 ) stranded tax effect in the minimum pension liability component, ( $194,000 ) stranded tax effect in the split dollar life insurance arrangement component, and a ( $88,000 ) stranded tax effect in the net unrealized investment gain component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P314_S1	The stranded tax effect related to the other post retirement obligations component was not material.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P315_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $10,006,000 stranded tax effect in the minimum pension liability component, $935,000 stranded tax effect in the other post retirement obligations component, $747,000 stranded tax effect in the split dollar life insurance arrangement component, and a $557,000 stranded tax effect in the net unrealized investment gain component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P315_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2013, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P316_S0	As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $534,000 stranded tax effect in the minimum pension liability component of other comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P316_S1	With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P317_S0	The stranded tax effects described above are in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes even though the impact of the act and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance described above were initially established as an adjustment to comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P317_S1	This amount will remain indefinitely as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P317_S2	As described in Note 21, the Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2018-02 will have accumulated other comprehensive income.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P317_S3	Refer to Note 21 for additional information.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P318_S0	The activity by year related to investments, including reclassification adjustments for activity included in earnings are as follows (all items shown net of tax):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P319_S0	Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income by component for the year ended March 31, 2018 are as follows (in thousands):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P320_S0	Details of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended March 31, 2018 are as follows (in thousands):
1005229_18_ITEM8_P321_S0	(1) These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P322_S0	This ASU adds guidance to ASC 740, Income Taxes, that contain SEC guidance related to SAB 118 (codified as SEC SAB Topic 5.EE, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P322_S1	The standard is effective upon issuance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P322_S2	Refer to Note 16 for further information regarding the impact of the standard.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P323_S0	This ASU amends ASC 220, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P323_S1	In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P323_S2	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P324_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P325_S0	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P325_S1	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P325_S2	The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P326_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P326_S1	This ASU and various other amendments below which clarify the new revenue standard are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P327_S0	This ASU amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the FASB s new revenue standard (ASC 606).
1005229_18_ITEM8_P327_S1	The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s principal-versus-agent guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s control principle.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P327_S2	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P328_S0	ASU 2016-12 provides for amendments to ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, amending the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P328_S1	Specifically, ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P328_S2	In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P329_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P330_S0	The new revenue standard is effective for the Company on April 1, 2018 and the Company plans to adopt using the modified retrospective method whereas prior periods are not restated.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P330_S1	We have evaluated revenue from contracts with customers and have concluded that the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements at transition.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P330_S2	Therefore, we do not expect to record a material cumulative catch up adjustment to retained earnings for revenue differences identified due to the timing or amount of revenue.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P330_S3	We have updated our policies and internal control framework and implemented additional controls to facilitate accounting for certain projects under the new standard, specifically for certain rail and road and other custom projects in the EMEA region.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P330_S4	Lastly, the Company is still evaluating the impact of certain disclosures which are required under the new standard during the first quarter in fiscal 2019.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P331_S0	The standard better aligns an entity s financial reporting for hedging relationships with risk management activities and reduces the complexity for the application of hedge accounting.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P331_S1	Changes include the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively and the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P331_S2	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P331_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P332_S0	The standard clarifies how an operating entity determines the customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of ASC 853 by clarifying that the grantor is the customer of the operation services in all cases for those arrangements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P332_S1	The effective date is aligned with that of ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which is April 1, 2018 for the Company.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P332_S2	We do not anticipate that this standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P333_S0	The standard provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P333_S1	Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P334_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within the fiscal year, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P334_S1	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P335_S0	The standard removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill test.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P335_S1	Therefore, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying value is greater than the reporting unit's fair value.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P336_S0	The ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P336_S1	The Company has adopted this standard effective April 1, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P336_S2	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P337_S0	The standard requires that a single decision maker consider indirect interests held by related parties under common control on a proportionate basis in a manner consistent with its evaluation of indirect interests held through other related parties.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P338_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P338_S1	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P339_S0	This ASU makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P339_S1	ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P339_S2	The Company adopted this standard effective April 1, 2017.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P339_S3	Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding the impact of the standard in fiscal 2018.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P340_S0	This standard will require all leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P340_S1	This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P340_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and internal control framework and have started gathering lease agreements in order to compile a complete list.
1005229_18_ITEM8_P340_S3	Information about our undiscounted future lease payments and the timing of those payments is included in Note 17.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of March 31, 2018 , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO).
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2018 .
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P4_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited Columbus McKinnon Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria).
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ) of the Company and our report dated May 30, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P10_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1005229_18_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
