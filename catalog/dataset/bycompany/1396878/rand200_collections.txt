1396878_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The investment objective of USMI will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Metals Index Total Return (the Metals Index ), less USMI s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	The investment objective of USAI will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total Return (the Agriculture Index ), less USAI s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	The investment objective of USCUI will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return (the Copper Index ), less USCUI s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	USCF is required to evaluate the credit risk of UGA to the futures commission merchant, oversee the purchase and sale of UGA s units by certain authorized purchasers ( Authorized Purchasers ), review daily positions and margin requirements of UGA and manage UGA s investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	USCF also pays the fees of ALPS Distributors, Inc., which serves as the marketing agent for UGA (the Marketing Agent ), and Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ), which serves as the administrator (the Administrator ) and the custodian (the Custodian ) for UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Limited partners have no right to elect USCF as the general partner on an annual or any other continuing basis.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	If USCF voluntarily withdraws as general partner, however, the holders of a majority of UGA s outstanding units (excluding for purposes of such determination units owned, if any, by the withdrawing USCF and its affiliates) may elect its successor.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UGA s outstanding units (excluding units owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of four management directors, some of whom are also its executive officers (the Management Directors ), and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant to its limited liability company agreement, as amended from time to time.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Board has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis and Malcolm R. Fobes III).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	For additional information relating to the audit committee, please see Item 10.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Audit Committee in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, but may also consist of investment contracts for other types of gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	UGA may also invest in other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF is the investment in Futures Contracts and the management of UGA s investments in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and/or cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB), for delivery to the New York harbor, traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that the changes in its NAV will closely track the changes in the price of the NYMEX futures contract for gasoline delivered to the New York harbor (the Benchmark Futures Contract ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	USCF believes changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	On any valuation day (a valuation day is any NYSE Arca trading day as of which UGA calculates its NAV as described herein), the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract will expire within two weeks of the valuation day, in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	As a specific benchmark, USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus 10 percent of B, where:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	B is the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities cause daily changes in UGA s unit price on the NYSE Arca to closely track daily changes in UGA s NAV per unit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	USCF further believes that the daily changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically closely tracked the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	USCF believes that the net effect of these two relationships and the expected relationship described above between UGA s NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s units on the NYSE Arca will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	An investment in the units provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	An investment in the units allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The expected correlation of the price of UGA s units, UGA s NAV and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is illustrated in the following diagram:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy intended to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s units for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the changes in the price of UGA s units will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	The anticipated monthly dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled in 2011 are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, Treasuries and amount of cash and/or cash equivalents held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	UGA s assets are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The units issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Purchasers and only in blocks of 100,000 units called Creation Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the units in the Creation Basket.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Purchasers may redeem units and only in blocks of 100,000 units called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, is the actual NAV of the units purchased or redeemed calculated at the end of the business day when notice for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	In addition, Authorized Purchasers pay UGA a $1,000 fee for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or redeem one or more Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate NAV intra-day based on the prior day s NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the basket price is determined based on the actual NAV at the end of the day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	While UGA issues units only in Creation Baskets, units may also be purchased and sold in much smaller increments on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	These transactions, however, are effected at the bid and ask prices established by specialist firm(s).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	Like any listed security, units can be purchased and sold at any time a secondary market is open.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	As an example, assume that a Creation Basket is sold by UGA, and that UGA s closing NAV per unit is $50.00.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	In that case, UGA would receive $5,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of the Creation Basket ($50.00 NAV per unit multiplied by 100,000 units, and excluding the Creation Basket fee of $1,000).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	If one were to assume further that USCF wants to invest the entire proceeds from the Creation Basket in the Benchmark Futures Contract and that the market value of the Benchmark Futures Contract is $59,950, UGA would be unable to buy the exact number of Benchmark Futures Contracts with an aggregate market value equal to $5,000,000.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	Instead, UGA would be able to purchase 83 Benchmark Futures Contracts with an aggregate market value of $4,975,850.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	Assuming a margin requirement equal to 10% of the value of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would be required to deposit $497,585 in Treasuries and cash with the futures commission merchant through which the Benchmark Futures Contracts were purchased.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P51_S5	The remainder of the proceeds from the sale of the Creation Basket, $4,502,415, would remain invested in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries as determined by USCF from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depends on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, as UGA reaches certain accountability levels or position limits on the NYMEX, or for other reasons, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as contracts in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the changes in percentage terms in UGA s NAV will continue to closely track the changes in percentage terms in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the units traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the NAV of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Additionally, futures contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the changes in the price of UGA s units traded on the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P55_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P55_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	In a Futures Contract, one party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	The price of gasoline futures contracts on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Certain typical and significant characteristics of Futures Contracts are discussed below.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Futures Contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	In addition, most U.S. futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by the NYMEX but does not limit the maximum daily price fluctuation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	The current accountability level for any one month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for gasoline, the NYMEX will monitor UGA s and the Related Public Funds exposure and ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S4	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX, it could also order UGA and the Related Public Funds to reduce their aggregate net position back to the accountability level.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P61_S5	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2010, UGA held a net of 660 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts and the Related Public Funds held 74 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures XB contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	As of December 31, 2010, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	If the NYMEX or the ICE Futures orders UGA to reduce its position back to the accountability level, or to an accountability level that the NYMEX or the ICE Futures deems appropriate for UGA, such an accountability level may impact the mix of investments in Gasoline Interests made by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	To illustrate, assume that the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract was $2, the unit price of UGA is $10, and that the NYMEX has determined that UGA may not own more than 10,000 Benchmark Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	In such case, UGA could invest up to $840 million of its daily net assets in the Benchmark Futures Contract ( i.e. , $2 per contract multiplied by 42,000 (a Benchmark Futures Contract is a contract for 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) multiplied by 10,000 contracts)) before reaching the accountability level imposed by the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	Once the daily net assets of the portfolio exceed $840 million in the Benchmark Futures Contract, the portfolio may not be able to make any further investments in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	If the NYMEX were to impose limits at the $840 million level (or another level), UGA anticipates that it would invest the majority of its assets above that level in a mix of other Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments in order to meet its investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated With Investing Directly or Indirectly in Gasoline Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	In addition to accountability levels, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	U.S. futures exchanges, including the NYMEX, also limit the amount of price fluctuation for Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	For example, the NYMEX imposes a $0.25 per gallon ($10,500 per contract) price fluctuation limit for the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	This limit is initially based off the previous trading day s settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	If any Benchmark Futures Contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S4	When trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be $0.25 per gallon in either direction of that point.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S5	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P67_S6	There is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Currently, U.S. futures exchanges, including the NYMEX, do not implement fixed position limits for futures contracts held outside of the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, requires the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits that apply to both cleared and uncleared commodity swaps in addition to exchange-traded futures contracts held by an entity and certain of its affiliates.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	Such position limits could limit UGA s ability to invest in accordance with its investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	On January 13, 2011, the CFTC proposed new rules, which, if implemented in their proposed form, would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain commodity futures, including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts, executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ( i.e., certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	The CFTC has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	At this time, it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S3	The CFTC s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire, which, under the CFTC s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges, could take effect as early as March 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S4	Based on the CFTC s current proposal, other position limits would not take effect until March 2012 or later.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P69_S5	The effect of this future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than gasoline contracts (such as futures contracts for crude oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Examples of the position and price limits currently imposed are as follows:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Any one month: 5,000 net futures / all months: 7,000 net futures, but not to exceed 1,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	$0.25 per gallon ($10,500 per contract) for all months.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	If any contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	When trading resumes, the limit is expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	There will be no maximum price fluctuation limits during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Any one month: 7,000 net futures / all months: 7,000 net futures, but not to exceed 1,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	There is no maximum daily price fluctuation limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Any one month: 10,000 net futures / all months: 20,000 net futures, but not to exceed 3,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	$10.00 per barrel ($10,000 per contract) for all months.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	If any contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	When trading resumes, the limit is expanded by $10.00 per barrel in either direction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $10.00 per barrel in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P77_S4	There will be no maximum price fluctuation limits during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Any one month: 20,000 net futures / all months: 20,000 net futures, but not to exceed 2,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	There is no maximum daily price fluctuation limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	Any one month: 5,000 net futures / all months: 7,000 net futures, but not to exceed 1,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	$0.25 per gallon ($10,500 per contract) for all months.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	If any contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	When trading resumes, the limit is expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	There will be no maximum price fluctuation limits during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Any one month: 6,000 net futures / all months: 12,000 net futures, but not to exceed 1,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	$3.00 per million British thermal units ( mmBtu ) ($30,000 per contract) for all months.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	If any contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	When trading resumes, the limit is expanded by $3.00 per mmBtu in either direction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $3.00 per mmBtu in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P83_S4	There will be no maximum price fluctuation limits during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Any one month: 6,000 net futures / all months: 12,000 net futures, but not to exceed 1,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	There is no maximum daily price fluctuation limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	There is no maximum daily price fluctuation limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Any one month: 10,000 net futures / all months: 20,000 net futures, but not to exceed 3,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	There is no maximum daily price fluctuation limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Despite daily price limits, the price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	These economic factors include changes in interest rates; governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; weather and climate conditions; changing supply and demand relationships; changes in balances of payments and trade; U.S. and international rates of inflation; currency devaluations and revaluations; U.S. and international political and economic events; and changes in philosophies and emotions of market participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA units, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post additional variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P92_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P92_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	In 2005, the NYMEX introduced new physical specifications for unleaded gasoline contracts to reflect the changes in the national standards for such fuels.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	Unleaded gasoline using MTBE was being phased out and replaced with unleaded gasoline using ethanol.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	As a result, NYMEX introduced a new gasoline futures contract in 2005.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P95_S3	The new futures contract trades under the ticker symbol RB .
1396878_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	The pre-existing unleaded gasoline futures contract, ticker symbol HU , ceased trading on December 29th, 2006.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	For a period of approximately 15 months both contracts were traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Crude oil is the world s most actively traded commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	The futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil that are traded on the NYMEX are the world s most liquid forum for crude oil trading, as well as the world s largest volume futures contract trading on a physical commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	Due to the liquidity and price transparency of oil futures contracts, they are used as a principal international pricing benchmark.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P97_S3	The futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil trade on the NYMEX in units of 1,000 U.S. barrels (42,000 gallons) and, if not closed out before maturity, will result in delivery of oil to Cushing, Oklahoma, which is also accessible to the international spot markets via pipelines.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	In Europe, Brent crude oil is the standard for futures contracts and is primarily traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Brent crude oil is the price reference for two-thirds of the world s traded oil.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	The ICE Brent Futures is a deliverable contract with an option to cash settle which trades in units of 1,000 barrels (42,000 U.S. gallons).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	The ICE Futures also offers a WTI Crude Oil Futures contract which trades in units of 1,000 barrels.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	The WTI Crude Oil Futures contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for U.S. light sweet crude oil.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P101_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P102_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflict in Iraq represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P102_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	Heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for approximately 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	The heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market trading center.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	The price of heating oil has historically been volatile.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 mmBtu and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	Other than investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA only invests in assets to support these investments in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	At any given time, most of UGA s investments are in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P110_S2	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a stated value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 10% to 15% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P110_S3	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the futures commission merchant and would separately hold, through its Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 10% to 15% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	In addition to the Treasuries or cash it posts with the futures commission merchant for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA holds, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as margin or as collateral to support its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P112_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P112_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P112_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are traded in sufficient volume to permit, in the opinion of USCF, ease of taking and liquidating positions in these financial interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	While certain of the gasoline futures contracts traded on the NYMEX can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P114_S1	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	While UGA s historical ratio of initial margin to total assets has generally ranged from approximately 10% to 15%, USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under UGA s Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	While USCF does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	UGA maintains the value of its Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or collateral, to at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	UGA has not established and does not plan to establish credit lines.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P119_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as over-the-counter contracts) are usually entered into between two parties.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P120_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	Some gasoline-based derivatives transactions contain fairly generic terms and conditions and are available from a wide range of participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	Other gasoline-based derivatives have highly customized terms and conditions and are not as widely available.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P121_S2	Many of these over-the-counter contracts are cash-settled forwards for the future delivery of gasoline- or petroleum-based fuels that have terms similar to the Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P121_S3	Others take the form of swaps in which the two parties exchange cash flows based on pre-determined formulas tied to the gasoline spot price, forward gasoline price, the Benchmark Futures Contract price, or other gasoline futures contract price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P121_S4	For example, UGA may enter into over-the-counter derivative contracts whose value will be tied to changes in the difference between the gasoline spot price, the Benchmark Futures Contract price, or some other futures contract price traded on the NYMEX or ICE Futures and the price of other Futures Contracts that may be invested in by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	To protect itself from the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA may enter into agreements with each counterparty that provide for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, such as the agreements published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	UGA also may require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support to address UGA s exposure to the counterparty.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P123_S1	Furthermore, USCF, on behalf of UGA, only enters into over-the-counter contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P123_S2	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by USCF s Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P123_S3	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P124_S2	The effect of holding such combined positions is to adjust the sensitivity of UGA to changes in the price relationship between futures contracts which will expire sooner and those that will expire later.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P124_S3	UGA would use such a spread if USCF felt that taking such long and short positions, when combined with the rest of its holdings, would more closely track the investment goals of UGA, or if USCF felt it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	UGA would enter into a straddle when it chooses to take an option position consisting of a long (or short) position in both a call option and put option.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	The economic effect of holding certain combinations of put options and call options can be very similar to that of owning the underlying futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P126_S1	UGA would make use of such a straddle approach if, in the opinion of USCF, the resulting combination would more closely track the investment goals of UGA or if it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	UGA has not employed any hedging methods since all of its investments have been made over an exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	Therefore, UGA has not been exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

1396878_11_ITEM1_P140_S2	Actions with respect to UBS Securities futures commission merchant business are publicly available on the website of the National Futures Association (http://www.nfa.futures.org/).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	On June 27, 2007, the Securities Division of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ( Massachusetts Securities Division ) filed an administrative complaint (the Complaint ) and notice of adjudicatory proceeding against UBS Securities, captioned In The Matter of UBS Securities, LLC, Docket No. E-2007-0049, which alleged that UBS Securities violated the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (the Act ) and related regulations by providing the advisers for certain hedge funds with gifts and gratuities in the form of below market office rents, personal loans with below market interest rates, event tickets, and other perks, in order to induce those hedge fund advisers to increase or retain their level of prime brokerage fees paid to UBS Securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	The Complaint seeks a cease and desist order from conduct that violates the Act and regulations, to censure UBS Securities, to require UBS Securities to pay an administrative fine of an unspecified amount, and to find as fact the allegations of the Complaint.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	In the summer of 2008, the Massachusetts Securities Division, Texas State Securities Board, and the New York Attorney General (the NYAG ) all brought actions against UBS Securities and UBS Financial Services, Inc. ( UBS Financial ), alleging violations of various state law anti-fraud provisions in connection with the marketing and sale of auction rate securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	On August 8, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial reached agreements in principle with the SEC, the NYAG, the Massachusetts Securities Division and other state regulatory agencies represented by the North American Securities Administrators Association ( NASAA ) to restore liquidity to all remaining client s holdings of auction rate securities by June 30, 2012.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	On October 2, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial entered into a final consent agreement with the Massachusetts Securities Division settling all allegations in the Massachusetts Securities Division s administrative proceeding against UBS Securities and UBS Financial with regards to the auction rate securities matter.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P143_S2	On December 11, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial executed an Assurance of Discontinuance in the auction rate securities settlement with the NYAG.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	On the same day, UBS Securities and UBS Financial finalized settlements with the SEC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P144_S1	UBS paid penalties of $75M to NYAG and an additional $75M to be apportioned among the participating NASAA states.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P144_S2	In March 2010, UBS and NASAA agreed on final settlement terms, pursuant to which, UBS agreed to provide client liquidity up to an additional $200 million.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	On August 14, 2008 the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation filed an administrative action against UBS Securities relating to a student loan issuer, the New Hampshire Higher Education Loan Corp. ( NHHELCO ).

1396878_11_ITEM1_P145_S3	UBS paid $750,000 to the Bureau for all costs associated with the Bureau s investigation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P145_S4	UBS entered a separate civil settlement with NHHELCO and provided a total financial benefit of $20M to NHHELCO.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	On April 29, 2010, the CFTC issued an order with respect to UBS Securities and levied a fine of $200,000.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	The Order stated that on February 6, 2009, UBS Securities employee broker aided and abetted UBS Securities customer s concealment of material facts from the NYMEX in violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 13(a)(4) (2006).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	Pursuant to NYMEX Rules, a block trade must be reported to the NYMEX within five minutes of the time of execution consistent with the requirements of NYMEX Rule 6.21C(A)(6).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	Although the block trade in question was executed earlier in the day, UBS Securities employee broker aided and abetted its customer s concealment of facts when, in response to the customer s request to delay reporting the trade until after the close of trading, UBS Securities employee did not report the trade until after the close.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P147_S2	Because the employee broker undertook his actions within the scope of his employment, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), and SEC Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. 1.2 (2009), UBS Securities is liable for the employee broker s aiding and abetting of its customer s violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the CEA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P147_S3	The fine has been paid and the matter is now closed.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	UBS Securities will act only as clearing broker for UGA and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	UBS Securities has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K. UBS Securities neither will act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF nor participate in the management of USCF or UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	UBS Securities is not affiliated with UGA or USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	Therefore, UGA does not believe that UGA has any conflicts of interest with UBS Securities or their trading principals arising from their acting as UGA s futures commission merchant.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	Currently, USCF does not employ commodity trading advisors for trading of UGA contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	USCF currently does, however, employ a trading advisor for USCI SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC ( SummerHaven ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	If, in the future, USCF does employ commodity trading advisors for UGA, it will choose each advisor based on arm s-length negotiations and will consider the advisor s experience, fees and reputation.

1396878_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	USCF also will pay transaction charge fees to BBH Co., ranging from $7.00 to $15.00 per transaction for the funds.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of NAV on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.

1396878_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	USCF has no obligation to pay such expenses in subsequent periods.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	Expenses Paid by UGA through December 31, 2010 as a Percentage of Average Daily Net Assets:

1396878_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring units in certificated form.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P166_S2	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the units in certificated form in the registry (the Register ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P166_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of units in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P166_S4	The beneficial interests in such units are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in DTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	Instead, units are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P167_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the units outstanding at any time.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	Unitholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the units through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding units through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P168_S2	Units are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P169_S1	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	Transfers of Units Only Through DTC .
1396878_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	The units are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P170_S2	Limited partners who are not DTC Participants may transfer their units through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their units (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their units are held) to transfer the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P170_S3	Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	Transfers of interests in units with DTC are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of DTC and the nature of the transfer.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	DTC has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and/or accountholders of DTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P172_S1	Because DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a definitive security in respect of such interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	DTC has advised UGA that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a unitholder (including, without limitation, the presentation of a global certificate for exchange) only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants in whose account with DTC interests in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such DTC Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P174_S0	All purchasers of UGA s units, and potentially any purchasers of units in the future, who wish to become limited partners or other record holders and receive cash distributions, if any, or have certain other rights, must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that, among other things, he, she or it agrees to be bound by UGA s LP Agreement and is eligible to purchase UGA s securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P174_S1	Each purchaser of units must execute a transfer application and certification.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P174_S2	The obligation to provide the form of transfer application is imposed on the seller of units or, if a purchase of units is made through an exchange, the form may be obtained directly through UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P174_S3	Further, USCF may request each record holder to furnish certain information, including that record holder s nationality, citizenship or other related status.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P175_S0	A record holder is a unitholder that is, or has applied to be, a limited partner.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P175_S1	An investor who is not a U.S. resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or one of UGA s limited partners if that investor s ownership would subject UGA to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of UGA s assets under any federal, state or local law or regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P175_S2	If the record holder fails to furnish the information or if USCF determines, on the basis of the information furnished by the holder in response to the request, that such holder is not qualified to become one of UGA s limited partners, USCF may be substituted as a holder for the record holder, who will then be treated as a non-citizen assignee, and UGA will have the right to redeem those securities held by the record holder.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P176_S0	A transferee s broker, agent or nominee may complete, execute and deliver a transfer application and certification.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P177_S0	UGA may, at its discretion, treat the nominee holder of a unit as the absolute owner.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P177_S1	In that case, the beneficial holder s rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P178_S0	A person purchasing UGA s existing units, who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P178_S1	Whether or not a transfer application is received or the consent of USCF obtained, UGA s units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing transfers of securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P179_S0	Any transfer of units will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by USCF unless a completed transfer application is delivered to USCF or the Administrator.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P179_S1	When acquiring units, the transferee of such units that completes a transfer application will:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P180_S0	make the consents and waivers contained in UGA s LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P181_S0	An assignee will become a limited partner in respect of the transferred units upon the consent of USCF as general partner of UGA and the recordation of the name of the assignee on UGA s books and records.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P181_S1	Such consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of USCF as general partner of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P182_S0	If consent of USCF is withheld, such transferee shall be an assignee.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P183_S0	An assignee shall have an interest in the partnership equivalent to that of a limited partner with respect to allocations and distributions, including, without limitation, liquidating distributions, of the partnership.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P183_S1	With respect to voting rights attributable to units that are held by assignees, USCF shall be deemed to be the limited partner with respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such units on any matter, vote such units at the written direction of the assignee who is the record holder of such units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P183_S2	If no such written direction is received, such units will not be voted.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P183_S3	An assignee shall have no other rights of a limited partner.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P184_S0	Until a unit has been transferred on UGA s books, UGA and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the unit as the absolute owner for all purposes, except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P185_S0	As discussed in the LP Agreement, if USCF gives at least fifteen (15) days written notice to a limited partner, then USCF may for any reason, in its sole discretion, require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P185_S1	If USCF does not give at least fifteen (15) days written notice to a limited partner, then it may only require withdrawal of all or any portion of the capital account of any limited partner in the following circumstances: (i) the unitholder made a misrepresentation to USCF in connection with its purchase of units; or (ii) the limited partner s ownership of units would result in the violation of any law or regulations applicable to the partnership or a partner.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P185_S2	In these circumstances, USCF without notice may require the withdrawal at any time, or retroactively.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P185_S3	The limited partner thus designated shall withdraw from the partnership or withdraw that portion of its partner capital account specified, as the case may be, as of the close of business on such date as determined by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P185_S4	The limited partner thus designated shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the partnership or to have made a partial withdrawal from its partner capital account, as the case may be, without further action on the part of the limited partner and the provisions of the LP Agreement shall apply.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P186_S0	UGA s NAV is calculated by:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P187_S0	BBH Co., the Administrator, calculates the NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P187_S1	The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P187_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P187_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF, which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P188_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P188_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing NAV per unit of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P188_S2	The prices reported for the active Benchmark Futures Contract month are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P188_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P189_S0	The indicative fund value unit basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S0	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per unit basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S1	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S2	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S3	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S4	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s units are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline futures contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P190_S5	As a result, during those gaps there will be no update to the indicative fund value.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P191_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P191_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P192_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA units on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P192_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P192_S2	If the market price of UGA units diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P192_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA units on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P192_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P193_S0	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA are valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P193_S1	These investments are not included in the indicative value.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P194_S0	The indicative fund value is based on the prior day s NAV and moves up and down solely according to changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P195_S0	UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P195_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P196_S0	Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P196_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S0	To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S1	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S2	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or unitholder or Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S3	Authorized Purchasers pay a transaction fee of $1,000 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S4	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S5	As of December 31, 2010, 10 Authorized Purchasers had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P197_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA issued 11 Creation Baskets and redeemed 14 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P198_S0	Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to have the facility to participate directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P198_S1	In some cases, an Authorized Purchaser or its affiliates may from time to time acquire gasoline or sell gasoline and may profit in these instances.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P198_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Purchaser s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will impact the price of gasoline, Futures Contracts, or the price of the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P199_S0	Each Authorized Purchaser is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be licensed as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P199_S1	Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P199_S2	Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P200_S0	Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, USCF has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P201_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P202_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P202_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P202_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P203_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P204_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with UGA, as described below.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P204_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P204_S2	Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a creation request.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P205_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to purchase is accepted as the number of units to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P205_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P205_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P206_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P207_S0	An Authorized Purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P207_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Purchaser s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P207_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA is borne solely by the Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P208_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P208_S1	UGA s NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P209_S0	USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent may reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P210_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P211_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual unitholder to redeem any units in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S5	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S6	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P212_S7	Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a redemption request.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P213_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of Treasuries and cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of units to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P213_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P213_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the redemption order date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P214_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P214_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P214_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P214_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P214_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P215_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P215_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P215_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P215_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P216_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P216_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Purchaser Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P216_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of units being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding units to 100,000 units ( i.e. , one basket) or less, unless USCF has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding units and can deliver them.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P217_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee to UGA of $1,000 per order to create or redeem baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P217_S1	An order may include multiple baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P217_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P217_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P218_S0	Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax or interest thereon.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P219_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P219_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S2	An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public units of any baskets it does create.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S3	Authorized Purchasers that do offer to the public units from the baskets they create will do so at per-unit offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Purchaser purchased the Creation Baskets and the NAV of the units at the time of the offer of the units to the public, the supply of and demand for units at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S4	The prices of units offered by Authorized Purchasers are expected to fall between UGA s NAV and the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P220_S5	Units initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P221_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Purchaser on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P221_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P221_S2	Units trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P221_S3	Units may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their NAV per unit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P221_S4	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per unit may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell units in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.

1396878_11_ITEM1_P369_S0	Ameristock Corporation is an affiliate of USCF through common control.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P370_S0	Ameristock Corporation is a California-based registered investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, that has been sponsoring and providing portfolio management services to mutual funds since 1995.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P370_S1	Ameristock Corporation is the investment adviser to the Ameristock Mutual Fund, Inc., a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), that focuses on large cap U.S. equities that has $201,394,335 in assets as of December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P370_S2	Ameristock Corporation was also the investment advisor to the Ameristock ETF Trust, an open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act that consisted of five separate investment portfolios, each of which sought investment results, before fees and expenses, that corresponded generally to the price and yield performance of a particular U.S. Treasury securities index owned and compiled by Ryan Holdings LLC and Ryan ALM, Inc.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P370_S3	The Ameristock ETF Trust liquidated each of its investment portfolios as of June 20, 2008, and has wound up its affairs effective September 21, 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P371_S0	USCF applies substantially all of UGA s assets toward trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P371_S1	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_11_ITEM1_P372_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P373_S0	USCF deposits substantially all of UGA s net assets with the Custodian or other custodian for trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P374_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit with the selling futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P374_S1	This deposit is known as margin.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P374_S2	UGA invests the remainder of its assets equal to the difference between the margin deposited and the market value of the Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P375_S0	UGA s assets are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P375_S1	USCF believes that all entities that hold or trade UGA s assets are based in the United States and are subject to United States regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P376_S0	Approximately 10% to 15% of UGA s assets have normally been committed as margin for Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P376_S1	However, from time to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P376_S2	USCF invests the balance of UGA s assets not invested in Gasoline Interests or held in margin as reserves to be available for changes in margin.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P376_S3	All income is used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P377_S0	The futures commission merchant, a government agency or a commodity exchange could increase margins applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P377_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions taken.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P378_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P378_S1	In December 2000, the CEA was amended by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (the CFMA ), which substantially revised the regulatory framework governing certain commodity interest transactions and the markets on which they trade.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P378_S2	The CEA, as amended by the CFMA, now provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon the variables of the transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P378_S3	In general, these variables include (1) the type of instrument being traded (e.g., contracts for future delivery, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (retail, eligible contract participant, or eligible commercial entity), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P378_S4	Information regarding commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries, and their associated regulatory environment, is provided below.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P379_S0	The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P379_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P379_S2	Under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in UGA or the ability of UGA to continue to implement its investment strategy.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P379_S3	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P380_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P381_S0	In the wake of the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, the Administration, federal regulators and Congress are revisiting the regulation of the financial sector, including the securities and commodities markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P381_S1	These efforts are anticipated to result in significant changes in the regulation of these markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P382_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P382_S1	Provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy-based and other commodity futures contracts, certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over-the-counter commodity contracts; new registration, recordkeeping, capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P382_S2	Additionally, the new law requires the aggregation, for purposes of position limits, of all positions in commodity futures and certain commodity swaps held by a single entity and its affiliates, whether such positions exist on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P383_S0	The CFTC, along with the SEC and other federal regulators, has been tasked with developing the rules and regulations enacting the provisions noted above.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P383_S1	The new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact UGA s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P383_S2	In particular, new position limits imposed on UGA or its counterparties may impact UGA s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective and new requirements, including capital and mandatory clearing, may increase the cost of UGA s investments and doing business.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P383_S3	For a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the CFTC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P383_S4	in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P384_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P384_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P384_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P385_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P385_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P385_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P386_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P386_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P386_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the over-the-counter markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P387_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P388_S0	The forward markets provide what has typically been a highly liquid market for foreign exchange trading, and in certain cases the prices quoted for foreign exchange forward contracts may be more favorable than the prices for foreign exchange futures contracts traded on U.S. exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P388_S1	To date, the forward markets have been largely unregulated, forward contracts have been executed bilaterally and, in general, forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P389_S0	Commercial banks participating in trading foreign exchange forward contracts often have not required margin deposits, but have relied upon internal credit limitations and their judgments regarding the creditworthiness of their counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P389_S1	In recent years, however, many over-the-counter market participants in foreign exchange trading have begun to require that their counterparties post margin.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P390_S0	Forward contracts may be treated differently under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P391_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and be cleared through regulated clearing organizations (which are referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as derivatives clearing organizations ).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P391_S1	However, not all forward contracts will be subject to regulation as swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P391_S2	Those forward contracts that will not be regulated as swaps, which include physically-settled non-financial commodity forward contracts, will also not be subject to the Dodd-Frank Act s execution and clearing requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P391_S3	With respect to foreign exchange forward contracts, the Dodd-Frank Act contemplates that such contracts may be regulated as swaps but gives the Secretary of the United States Department of Treasury ( Treasury ) the authority to exempt them from certain regulation under the CEA, including mandatory clearing and margin requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P391_S4	To date, the Secretary of Treasury has not made any final determinations on this issue.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P392_S0	Absent a clearing facility (whether because of regulatory requirements or otherwise), UGA s trading in foreign exchange and other forward contracts is exposed to the creditworthiness of the counterparties on the other side of the trade.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P393_S0	The organized exchanges and swap execution facilities on which swaps may be traded, the regulation and criteria for such trading and the regulation and criteria for clearing organizations are more fully described below under Futures Exchanges and Clearing Organizations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P394_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P394_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P394_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P395_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P395_S1	Thus, the seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P395_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P396_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P396_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P397_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P397_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P398_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P398_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P398_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P398_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P399_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P399_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P399_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P399_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P399_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P400_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P401_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P401_S1	However, similar to forward contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P401_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P402_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P402_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P403_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P403_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P403_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P404_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P404_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P405_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P405_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P405_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P405_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act contains many provisions, which, once rules and regulations are implemented, would impact swap transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S1	At this time, it is unclear exactly what types of transactions will be regulated as swaps because the CFTC has not implemented regulations with respect to the definition of swap.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through clearing organizations, but it is also currently unknown which swaps will be subject to such trading and clearing requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S3	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S4	Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or another regulator, as prescribed by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S5	At this time, the CFTC has not promulgated final regulations to determine which entities will be regulated as swap dealers and major swap participants and thus have to comply with these capital and margin requirements (as well as a multitude of other requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P406_S6	In general, increased regulation of, and the imposition of additional costs on, swap transactions could have an adverse effect on USCF by, for example, reducing the size of and therefore liquidity in the derivatives market, increasing transaction costs and decreasing the ability to customize derivative transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P407_S0	The two broad classes of persons who trade commodities are hedgers and speculators.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P407_S1	Hedgers include financial institutions that manage or deal in interest rate-sensitive instruments, foreign currencies or stock portfolios, and commercial market participants, such as farmers and manufacturers, that market or process commodities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P408_S0	Hedging is a protective procedure designed to effectively lock in prices that would otherwise change due to an adverse movement in the price of the underlying commodity, for example, the adverse price movement between the time a merchandiser or processor enters into a contract to buy or sell a raw or processed commodity at a certain price and the time he must perform the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P408_S1	In such a case, at the time the hedger contracts to physically sell the commodity at a future date he will simultaneously buy a futures or forward contract for the necessary equivalent quantity of the commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P408_S2	At the time for performance of the contract, the hedger may accept delivery under his futures contract and sell the commodity quantity as required by his physical contract or he may buy the actual commodity, sell it under the physical contract and close out his position by making an offsetting sale of a futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P409_S0	The commodity interest markets enable the hedger to shift the risk of price fluctuations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P410_S0	The usual objective of the hedger is to protect the profit that he expects to earn from farming, merchandising, or processing operations rather than to profit from his trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P410_S1	However, at times the impetus for a hedge transaction may result in part from speculative objectives and hedgers can end up paying higher prices than they would have, for example, if current market prices are lower than the locked in price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P411_S0	Unlike the hedger, the speculator generally expects neither to make nor take delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P411_S1	Instead, the speculator risks his capital with the hope of making profits from price fluctuations in the commodities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P411_S2	The speculator is, in effect, the risk bearer who assumes the risks that the hedger seeks to avoid.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P412_S0	Speculators rarely make or take delivery of the underlying commodity; rather they attempt to close out their positions prior to the delivery date.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P412_S1	Because the speculator may take either a long or short position in commodities, it is possible for him to make profits or incur losses regardless of whether prices go up or down.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P413_S0	Futures exchanges provide centralized market facilities in which multiple persons have the ability to execute or trade contracts by accepting bids and offers from multiple participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P413_S1	Futures exchanges may provide for execution of trades at a physical location utilizing trading pits and/or may provide for trading to be done electronically through computerized matching of bids and offers pursuant to various algorithms.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P413_S2	Members of a particular exchange and the trades executed on such exchange are subject to the rules of that exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P413_S3	Futures exchanges and clearing organizations are given reasonable latitude in promulgating rules and regulations to control and regulate their members.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P413_S4	Examples of regulations by exchanges and clearing organizations include the establishment of initial margin levels, rules regarding trading practices, contract specifications, speculative position limits, daily price fluctuation limits, and execution and clearing fees.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S0	Clearing organizations provide services designed to mutualize or transfer the credit risk arising from the trading of contracts on an exchange or other electronic trading facility.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S1	Once trades made between members of an exchange or electronic trading facility have been confirmed, the clearing organization becomes substituted for the clearing member acting on behalf of each buyer and each seller of contracts traded on the exchange or trading platform and in effect becomes the other party to the trade.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S2	Thereafter, each clearing member party to the trade looks only to the clearing organization for performance.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S3	The clearing organization generally establishes some sort of security or guarantee fund to which all clearing members of the exchange must contribute; this fund acts as an emergency buffer that is intended to enable the clearing organization to meet its obligations with regard to the other side of an insolvent clearing member s contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S4	Furthermore, the clearing organization requires margin deposits and continuously marks positions to market to provide some assurance that its members will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S5	Thus, a central function of the clearing organization is to ensure the integrity of trades, and members effecting transactions on an exchange need not concern themselves with the solvency of the party on the opposite side of the trade; their only remaining concerns are the respective solvencies of their own customers, their clearing broker and the clearing organization.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P414_S6	The clearing organizations do not deal with customers, but only with their member firms and the guarantee of performance for open positions provided by the clearing organization does not run to customers.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P415_S0	As required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has recently issued several proposed rules pertaining to clearing organizations (referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as derivatives clearing organizations ) to address the clearing organization application process, recordkeeping and reporting obligations for clearing organizations, and implement the following six core principles for clearing organizations: participant and product eligibility, risk management, settlement procedures, treatment of funds, default rules and procedures and system safeguards.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P415_S1	The proposed rules require the clearing organizations to establish margin methodologies and require that margin be based on trades at the individual customer level as opposed to the clearing member level.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P415_S2	The proposed rules also require the clearing organization to report end-of-day positions at the customer level, as opposed to the clearing member level.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P415_S3	To date, the CFTC has not implemented any final rules or regulations pertaining to the application process, recordkeeping and reporting, core principles, margin or any other requirements for clearing organizations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P416_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the CFTC based on their designation as one of the following: a designated contract market, a derivatives transaction execution facility, an exempt board of trade or an electronic trading facility.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P417_S0	A designated contract market is the most highly regulated level of futures exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P417_S1	Designated contract markets may offer products to retail customers on an unrestricted basis.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P418_S0	To be designated as a contract market, the exchange must demonstrate that it satisfies specified general criteria for designation, such as having the ability to prevent market manipulation, rules and procedures to ensure fair and equitable trading, position limits, dispute resolution procedures, minimization of conflicts of interest and protection of market participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P418_S1	Among the principal designated contract markets in the United States are the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P418_S2	Each of the designated contract markets in the United States must provide for the clearance and settlement of transactions with a CFTC-registered clearing organization.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P419_S0	A derivatives transaction execution facility (a DTEF ) is a type of exchange that is subject to fewer regulatory requirements than a designated contract market but is subject to both commodity interest and participant limitations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P419_S1	DTEFs limit access to eligible traders that qualify as either eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities for futures and option contracts on commodities that have a nearly inexhaustible deliverable supply, are highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation, or have no cash market, security futures products, and futures and option contracts on commodities that the CFTC may determine, on a case-by-case basis, are highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P419_S2	In addition, certain commodity interests excluded or exempt from the CEA, such as swaps, etc. may be traded on a DTEF.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P419_S3	There is no requirement that a DTEF use a clearing organization, except with respect to trading in security futures contracts, in which case the clearing organization must be a securities clearing agency.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P419_S4	However, if futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a DTEF are cleared, then it must be through a CFTC-registered clearing organization, except that some excluded or exempt commodities traded on a DTEF may be cleared through a clearing organization other than one registered with the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P420_S0	An exempt board of trade is also a designated form of exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P420_S1	An exempt board of trade is substantially unregulated, subject only to CFTC anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S0	An exempt board of trade is permitted to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts provided that the underlying commodity is not a security or securities index and has an inexhaustible deliverable supply or no cash market.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S1	All traders on an exempt board of trade must qualify as eligible contract participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S2	Contracts deemed eligible to be traded on an exempt board of trade include contracts on interest rates, exchange rates, currencies, credit risks or measures, debt instruments, measures of inflation, or other macroeconomic indices or measures.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S3	There is no requirement that an exempt board of trade use a clearing organization.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S4	However, if contracts on an exempt board of trade are cleared, then it must be through a CFTC-registered clearing organization.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P421_S5	A board of trade electing to operate as an exempt board of trade must file a written notification with the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P422_S0	An electronic trading facility is a form of trading platform that operates by means of an electronic or telecommunications network and maintains an automated audit trail of bids, offers, and the matching of orders or the execution of transactions on the electronic trading facility.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P422_S1	The CEA does not apply to, and the CFTC has no jurisdiction over, transactions on an electronic trading facility in certain excluded commodities that are entered into between principals that qualify as eligible contract participants, subject only to CFTC anti-fraud and anti- manipulation authority.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P423_S0	In general, excluded commodities include interest rates, currencies, securities, securities indices or other financial, economic or commercial indices or measures.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P424_S0	USCF intends to monitor the development of and opportunities and risks presented by the less-regulated exchanges and exempt boards as well as other trading platforms currently in place or that are being considered by regulators and may, in the future, allocate a percentage of UGA s assets to trading in products on these exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P424_S1	Provided UGA maintains assets exceeding $5 million, UGA would qualify as an eligible contract participant and thus would be able to trade on such exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P425_S0	Non-U.S. futures exchanges differ in certain respects from their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P425_S1	Importantly, non-U.S. futures exchanges are not subject to regulation by the CFTC, but rather are regulated by their home country regulator.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P425_S2	In contrast to U.S. designated contract markets, some non-U.S. exchanges are principals markets, where trades remain the liability of the traders involved, and the exchange or an affiliated clearing organization, if any, does not become substituted for any party.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P425_S3	Due to the absence of a clearing system, such exchanges are significantly more susceptible to disruptions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P425_S4	Further, participants in such markets must often satisfy themselves as to the individual creditworthiness of each entity with which they enter into a trade.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P426_S0	Trading on non-U.S. exchanges is often in the currency of the exchange s home jurisdiction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P426_S1	Consequently, UGA is subject to the additional risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between such currencies and U.S. dollars and the possibility that exchange controls could be imposed in the future.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P427_S0	Trading on non-U.S. exchanges may differ from trading on U.S. exchanges in a variety of ways and, accordingly, may subject UGA to additional risks.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P428_S0	The CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than a hedger, which UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P428_S1	Among the purposes of accountability levels and position limits is to prevent a corner or squeeze on a market or undue influence on prices by any single trader or group of traders.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P429_S0	The position limits currently established by the CFTC apply to certain agricultural commodity interests, such as grains (oats, barley, and flaxseed), soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, eggs, rye, and potatoes, but not to interests in energy products.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P429_S1	In addition, U.S. exchanges may set accountability levels and position limits for all commodity interests traded on that exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P429_S2	For example, the current accountability level for investments at any one time in gasoline Futures Contracts (including investments in the Benchmark Futures Contract) on the NYMEX is 7,000 contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P429_S3	The NYMEX also imposes position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P429_S4	The ICE Futures has recently adopted similar accountability levels and position limits for certain of its Futures Contracts that are traded on the ICE Futures and settled against the price of a contract listed for trading on a U.S. designated contract market such as the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P430_S0	Certain exchanges or clearing organizations also set limits on the total net positions that may be held by a clearing broker.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P430_S1	In general, no position limits are in effect in forward or other over-the-counter contract trading or in trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges, although the principals with which UGA and the clearing brokers may trade in such markets may impose such limits as a matter of credit policy.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P430_S2	For purposes of determining accountability levels and position limits, UGA s commodity interest positions will not be attributable to investors in their own commodity interest trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P431_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to promulgate rules establishing position limits for futures and option contracts on commodities as well as for swaps that are economically equivalent to futures or options.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P431_S1	Currently, the exchanges impose position limits and accountability levels for certain commodity futures and options, but the CFTC does not impose such limits.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S0	On January 13, 2011, the CFTC proposed new rules, which if implemented in their proposed form, would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ( i.e., certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S1	The CFTC has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S2	At this time, it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S3	The CFTC s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire, which, under the CFTC s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges, could take effect as early as March 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S4	Based on the CFTC s current proposal, other position limits would not take effect until March 2012 or later.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P432_S5	The effect of this future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P433_S0	Currently, most U.S. futures exchanges (but generally not non-U.S. exchanges) may limit the amount of fluctuation in some futures contract or options on a futures contract prices during a single trading day by regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P433_S1	These regulations specify what are referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or, more commonly, daily limits.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S0	The daily limits establish the maximum amount that the price of a futures or options on a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S1	Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular futures or options on a futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S2	Positions in the futures or options contract may then be taken or liquidated, if at all, only at inordinate expense or if traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit during the period for trading on such day.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S3	Because the daily limit rule governs price movement only for a particular trading day, it does not limit losses and may in fact substantially increase losses because it may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S4	Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days, thus preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting the trader to substantial losses for those days.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P434_S5	The concept of daily price limits is not relevant to over-the-counter contracts, including forwards and swaps, and thus such limits are not imposed by banks and others who deal in those markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S0	In contrast, the NYMEX does not impose daily limits, but rather limits the amount of price fluctuation for gasoline futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S1	For example, the NYMEX imposes a $0.25 per gallon ($10,500 per contract) price fluctuation limit for the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S2	This limit is initially based off the previous trading day s settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S3	If any Benchmark Futures Contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S4	When trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be $0.25 per gallon in either direction of that point.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S5	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P435_S6	There is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P436_S0	Commodity prices are volatile and, although ultimately determined by the interaction of supply and demand, are subject to many other influences, including the psychology of the marketplace and speculative assessments of future world and economic events.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P436_S1	Political climate, interest rates, treaties, balance of payments, exchange controls and other governmental interventions as well as numerous other variables affect the commodity markets, and even with comparatively complete information it is impossible for any trader to predict reliably commodity prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P437_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, DTEF, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P437_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and CFTC regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P438_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P438_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P438_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S0	The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of CPOs and commodity trading advisors and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S1	Under the CEA, a registered CPO, such as USCF, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC describing its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S2	In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records of, and documents prepared by, registered CPOs.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S3	Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires CPOs to keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they operate.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S4	The CFTC may suspend the registration of a CPO: (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2) if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such person trading privileges on any exchange, and (3) in certain other circumstances.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S5	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing UGA, and might result in the termination of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P439_S6	UGA itself is not required to be registered with the CFTC in any capacity.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P440_S0	The CEA gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P440_S1	If a trading advisor s commodity trading advisor registration were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the trading advisor would be unable, until the registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P441_S0	The CEA requires all futures commission merchants, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P442_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P442_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by futures commission merchants and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P442_S2	The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P443_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P443_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P444_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S1	At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S2	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, CPOs, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, and their respective associated persons and floor brokers.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S3	USCF, each trading advisor, the selling agents and the clearing brokers are members of the NFA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S4	As such, they are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P445_S5	UGA itself is not required to become a member of the NFA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P446_S0	As the self-regulatory body of the commodity interest industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with these rules.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P446_S1	The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P447_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P447_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P447_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P448_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P448_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P449_S0	The function of the CFTC is to implement the objectives of the CEA of preventing price manipulation and other disruptions to market integrity, avoiding systemic risk, preventing fraud and promoting innovation, competition and financial integrity of transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P450_S0	As mentioned above, this regulation, among other things, provides that the trading of commodity interest contracts generally must be upon exchanges designated as contract markets or DTEFs and that all trading on those exchanges must be done by or through exchange members.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P451_S0	Under the CFMA, commodity interest trading in some commodities between sophisticated persons may be traded on a trading facility not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P451_S1	As a general matter, trading in spot contracts, forward contracts, options on forward contracts or commodities, or swap contracts between eligible contract participants is not within the jurisdiction of the CFTC and may therefore be effectively unregulated.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P451_S2	The trading advisors may engage in those transactions on behalf of UGA in reliance on this exclusion from regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P451_S3	However, legislation currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would remove the exclusion provided to these transactions and place them under federal regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P451_S4	The proposed legislation would subject these contracts to new capital, margin, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P452_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P452_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P453_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P453_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P453_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P454_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P454_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P454_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts traded on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P455_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P455_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P456_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P456_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P457_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 2%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P457_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P457_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P457_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P458_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P458_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P458_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P459_S0	Trading in the over-the-counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally does not require margin but generally does require the extension of credit between counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P459_S1	This extension of credit generally takes the form of transfers of collateral and/or independent amounts.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P459_S2	Collateral is transferred between counterparties during the term of an over-the-counter transaction based upon the changing value of the transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the start of an over-the-counter transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P460_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P460_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P460_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P461_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P462_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P462_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P462_S2	If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P462_S3	With respect to UGA s trading, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P463_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P464_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and SEC to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a derivatives clearing organization ( i.e., uncleared swaps).
1396878_11_ITEM1_P464_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P464_S2	At this time, the CFTC has proposed a rule addressing this statutory right of certain market participants but has not implemented any rules on this issue and has not implemented any regulations regarding the margin requirements for uncleared swaps.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P465_S0	UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P465_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P466_S0	UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P467_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND (U.S. Reg.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P467_S1	No. 3486625) for fund investment services in the field of gasoline futures contracts, cash-settled options on gasoline futures contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, over-the-counter transactions based on the price of gasoline, and indices based on the foregoing, in use since February 22, 2008, and UGA UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND, LP (and Design) (U.S. Reg.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P467_S2	No. 3638984) for investment services in the field of gasoline futures contracts and other gasoline related investments, in use since February 26, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P467_S3	UGA relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P467_S4	So long as UGA continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations, it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_11_ITEM1_P468_S0	USCF has been granted a patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,739,186) and is pursuing a patent application for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund ( ETF ) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Investing in Gasoline Interests subjects UGA to the risks of the gasoline industry and this could result in large fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	UGA is subject to the risks and hazards of the gasoline industry because it invests in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks and hazards that are inherent in the gasoline industry may cause the price of gasoline to widely fluctuate.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If the changes in percentage terms of UGA s units accurately track the changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price of gasoline, then the price of its units may also fluctuate.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The exploration for crude oil, the raw material used in the production of gasoline, and production of gasoline are uncertain processes with many risks.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells for crude oil is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production of gasoline, including:
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing activities involve numerous risks that may affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	There are a variety of hazards inherent in gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing, such as leaks, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes and flooding), pipeline failure, abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, and other hazards which could affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	To the extent these hazards limit the supply or delivery of gasoline, gasoline prices will increase.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The price of gasoline fluctuates on a seasonal basis and this would result in fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	For example, during the winter months the heating season can have a major impact on prices in the fuel industry.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During the summer months, people are more likely to travel by automobile when taking spring and summer vacations along with weekend trips.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The increase in travel drives fuel demand and gasoline prices typically follow.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Refineries usually use the spring months for major routine maintenance and to retool for summer gasoline blends required in various parts of the country to meet air emission requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Refinery maintenance as well as unplanned shut-downs reduce gasoline production.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Depending on inventory levels and the strength of gasoline demand, this situation may put pressure on prices until additional gasoline supplies can be imported.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Supply interruptions may also affect inventories.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 had a major impact on energy-producing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, where roughly one-third of oil production in the United States occurs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, the effects remain as repairs are continuing at some production and pipeline facilities that were severely damaged.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changes in the political climate could have negative consequences for gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Tensions with Iran, the world s fourth largest oil exporter, could put oil exports in jeopardy.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Other global concerns include civil unrest and sabotage affecting the flow of oil from Nigeria, a large oil exporter.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Meanwhile, friction continues between the governments of the United States and Venezuela, a major exporter of oil to the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Additionally, a series of production cuts by members of OPEC followed by a refusal to subsequently increase oil production have tightened world oil markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Limitations on ability to develop additional sources of oil could impact future prices of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the past, a supply disruption in one area of the world was softened by the ability of major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia to increase output to make up the difference.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Now, much of that spare reserve capacity has been absorbed by increased demand.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, consumption of gasoline and other oil products is increasing around the world, especially in rapidly growing countries such as India and China, which is now the world s second-largest energy user.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	According to the United States Government s Energy Information Administration, global oil demand is expected to rise by 1.47 million barrels a day in 2011, to a total global consumption of 86.65 million barrels per day in 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Gasoline demand in the United States has been growing less than in developing nations, but the United States remains the world s largest gasoline consumer, using an average of 378 million gallons a day in 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Gasoline refinement and production is subject to government regulations which could have an impact on the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Gasoline refinement and production in North America are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various state regulatory agencies.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, as a result of changes in fuel specifications, United States refiners in the spring and summer of 2006 began phasing out the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) and replacing it with ethanol.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The switch to ethanol, which is mandated by federal law, has resulted in a tightened supply and higher prices for this grain-based product.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Although increased use of ethanol is expected to bring environmental benefits, ethanol adds to gasoline production costs because it currently is more expensive than the MTBE it is replacing.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Various formulations and compositions of gasoline as may be required by different state environmental laws and/or the U.S. Government may impact the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Some areas of the country are required to use special formulations of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Environmental programs, aimed at reducing carbon monoxide, smog, and air toxics, include the Federal and/or state-required oxygenated, reformulated, and low-volatility (evaporates more slowly) gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Other environmental programs put restrictions on transportation and storage.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The reformulated gasoline required in some urban areas and in California cost more to produce than conventional gasoline served elsewhere, increasing the price paid at the pump.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Changing standards in the future may further impact the price of gasoline in this regard.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The price of UGA s units may be influenced by factors such as the short-term supply and demand for gasoline and the short-term supply and demand for UGA s units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	This may cause the units to trade at a price that is above or below UGA s NAV per unit.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Accordingly, changes in the price of units may substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If this variation occurs, then investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While it is expected that the trading prices of the units will fluctuate in accordance with changes in UGA s NAV, the prices of units may also be influenced by other factors, including the short-term supply and demand for gasoline and the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There is no guarantee that the units will not trade at appreciable discounts from, and/or premiums to, UGA s NAV.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	This may be harmful to investors because if changes in the price of units vary substantially from changes in the spot price of gasoline, then investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in UGA s NAV may not correlate with changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If this were to occur, investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets as fully as possible in short-term Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that the changes in percentage terms of the NAV closely correlate with the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	However, changes in UGA s NAV may not correlate with the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for several reasons as set forth below:
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	UGA (i) may not be able to buy/sell the exact amount of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with NAV; (ii) may not always be able to buy and sell Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at the market price; (iii) may not experience a perfect correlation between the spot price of gasoline and the underlying investments in Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents; and (iv) is required to pay fees, including brokerage fees and the management fee, which will have an effect on the correlation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Short-term supply and demand for gasoline may cause the changes in the market price of the Benchmark Futures Contract to vary from the changes in UGA s NAV if UGA has fully invested in Futures Contracts that do not reflect such supply and demand and it is unable to replace such contracts with Futures Contracts that do reflect such supply and demand.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, there are also technical differences between the two markets, e.g. , one is a physical market while the other is a futures market traded on exchanges, that may cause variations between the spot price of gasoline and the prices of related futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	UGA sells and buys only as many Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that it can to get the changes in percentage terms of the NAV as close as possible to the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The remainder of its assets are invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents and are used to satisfy initial margin and additional margin requirements, if any, and to otherwise support its investments in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents, both directly and as margin, provide rates of return that vary from changes in the value of the spot price of gasoline and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In addition, because UGA incurs certain expenses in connection with its investment activities, and holds most of its assets in more liquid short-term securities for margin and other liquidity purposes and for redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis, USCF is generally not able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments and there cannot be perfect correlation between changes in UGA s NAV and changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As UGA grows, there may be more or less correlation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, if UGA only has enough money to buy three Benchmark Futures Contracts and it needs to buy four contracts to track the price of gasoline then the correlation will be lower, but if it buys 20,000 Benchmark Futures Contracts and it needs to buy 20,001 contracts then the correlation will be higher.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	At certain asset levels, UGA may be limited in its ability to purchase the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments due to accountability levels imposed by the relevant exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	To the extent that UGA invests in these other Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract may be lower.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If UGA is required to invest in other Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are less correlated with the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would likely invest in over-the-counter contracts to increase the level of correlation of UGA s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Over-the-counter contracts entail certain risks described below under Over-the-Counter Contract Risk.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	UGA may not be able to buy the exact number of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract if the purchase price of Futures Contracts required to be fully invested in such contracts is higher than the proceeds received for the sale of a Creation Basket on the day the basket was sold.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In such case, UGA could not invest the entire proceeds from the purchase of the Creation Basket in such futures contracts (for example, assume UGA receives $4,000,000 for the sale of a Creation Basket and assume that the price of a Futures Contract for gasoline is $59,950, then UGA could only invest in only 66 Futures Contracts with an aggregate value of $3,956,700), UGA would be required to invest a percentage of the proceeds in cash, Treasuries or other liquid securities to be deposited as margin with the futures commission merchant through which the contracts were purchased.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The remainder of the purchase price for the Creation Basket would remain invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents or other liquid securities as determined by USCF from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If the trading market for Futures Contracts is suspended or closed, UGA may not be able to purchase these investments at the last reported price for such investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If changes in UGA s NAV do not correlate with changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, then investing in UGA may not be an effective way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with the spot price of gasoline and this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If this were to occur, then investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	When using the Benchmark Futures Contract as a strategy to track the spot price of gasoline, at best the correlation between changes in prices of such Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline can be only approximate.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for such Gasoline Interests and technical influences in futures trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If there is a weak correlation between the Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline, then the price of units may not accurately track the spot price of gasoline and investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	UGA may experience a loss if it is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The value of Treasuries generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If UGA is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired, UGA will experience a loss.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	This loss may adversely impact the price of the units and may decrease the correlation between the price of the units, the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	UGA may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market in its currency, its gasoline production or exports, or in another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Alternatively, limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and daily price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Unexpected market illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, UGA has not and does not intend at this time to establish a credit facility, which would provide an additional source of liquidity and instead relies only on the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it holds.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The anticipated large value of the positions in Futures Contracts that USCF will acquire or enter into for UGA increases the risk of illiquidity.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Other Gasoline-Related Investments that UGA invests in, such as negotiated over-the-counter contracts, may have a greater likelihood of being illiquid since they are contracts between two parties that take into account not only market risk, but also the relative credit, tax, and settlement risks under such contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Such contracts also have limited transferability that results from such risks and from the contract s express limitations.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA s Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If the nature of hedgers and speculators in futures markets has shifted such that gasoline purchasers are the predominant hedgers in the market, UGA might have to reinvest at higher futures prices or choose Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The changing nature of the hedgers and speculators in the gasoline market influences whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In order to induce speculators to take the corresponding long side of the same futures contract, gasoline producers must generally be willing to sell futures contracts at prices that are below expected future spot prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Conversely, if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the gasoline who purchase futures contracts to hedge against a rise in prices, then speculators will only take the short side of the futures contract if the futures price is greater than the expected future spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	This can have significant implications for UGA when it is time to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing Futures Contract into a new Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	While UGA does not intend to take physical delivery of gasoline under its Futures Contracts, physical delivery under such contracts impacts the value of the contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	While it is not the current intention of UGA to take physical delivery of gasoline under any of its Futures Contracts, futures contracts are not required to be cash-settled and it is possible to take delivery under some of these contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Storage costs associated with purchasing gasoline could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Storage costs include the time value of money invested in gasoline as a physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the gasoline less any benefits from ownership of gasoline that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In general, Futures Contracts have a one-month delay for contract delivery and the back month (the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month) includes storage costs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	To the extent that these storage costs change for gasoline while UGA holds Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the value of the Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and therefore UGA s NAV, may change as well.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The price relationship between the near month contract and the next month contract that compose the Benchmark Futures Contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of UGA s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other gasoline price indices total returns.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when the near month contract is sold and replaced with the next month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	As a result, the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track higher.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Conversely, in the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	As a result the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track lower.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of UGA s NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, this could have a significant negative impact on UGA s NAV and total return.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in UGA or the ability of UGA to continue to implement its investment strategy.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In the wake of the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, the Administration, federal regulators and Congress are revisiting the regulation of the financial sector, including securities and commodities markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These efforts are anticipated to result in significant changes in the regulation of these markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy-based and other commodity futures contracts, certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over-the-counter commodity contracts; new registration, recordkeeping, capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Additionally, the new law requires the aggregation, for purposes of position limits, of all positions in commodity futures and certain commodity swaps held by a single entity and its affiliates, whether such positions exist on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The CFTC, along with the SEC and other federal regulators, has been tasked with developing the rules and regulations enacting the provisions noted above.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact UGA s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In particular, new position limits imposed on UGA or its counterparties may impact UGA s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective and new requirements, including capital and mandatory clearing, may increase the cost of UGA s investments and doing business, which could adversely affect UGA s investors.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	For a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the CFTC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Investing in UGA for purposes of hedging may be subject to several risks including the possibility of losing the benefit of favorable market movement.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Participants in the gasoline or in other industries may use UGA as a vehicle to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There are several risks in connection with using UGA as a hedging device.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	While hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices, it can also preclude a hedger s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In a hedging transaction, the hedger may be concerned that the hedged item will increase in price, but must recognize the risk that the price may instead decline and if this happens he will have lost his opportunity to profit from the change in price because the hedging transaction will result in a loss rather than a gain.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Thus, the hedger foregoes the opportunity to profit from favorable price movements.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, if the hedge is not a perfect one, the hedger can lose on the hedging transaction and not realize an offsetting gain in the value of the underlying item being hedged.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	When using futures contracts as a hedging technique, at best, the correlation between changes in prices of futures contracts and of the items being hedged can be only approximate.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as: variations in speculative markets, demand for futures and for gasoline products, technical influences in futures trading, and differences between anticipated energy costs being hedged and the instruments underlying the standard futures contracts available for trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Even a well-conceived hedge may be unsuccessful to some degree because of unexpected market behavior as well as the expenses associated with creating the hedge.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, using an investment in UGA as a hedge for changes in energy costs ( e.g. , investing in crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas or other fuels, or electricity) may not correlate because changes in the spot price of gasoline may vary from changes in energy costs because changes in the spot price of gasoline may not be at the same rate as changes in the price of other energy products, and, in any case, the spot price of gasoline does not reflect the refining, transportation, and other costs that may impact the hedger s energy costs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on gasoline prices and gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	There is no historic evidence that the spot price of gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so unitholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage trading activities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. Howard Mah and John Hyland.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If Messrs. Mah or Hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Furthermore, Messrs. Mah and Hyland are currently involved in the management of the Related Public Funds, and USCF has filed a registration statement for three other exchange traded security funds, USMI, USAI and USCUI, each of which is a series of the Trust.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Mr. Mah is also employed by Ameristock Corporation, a registered investment adviser that manages a public mutual fund.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S4	It is estimated that Mr. Mah will spend approximately 90% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Mr. Hyland will spend approximately 100% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P74_S6	To the extent that USCF establishes additional funds, even greater demands will be placed on Messrs. Mah and Hyland, as well as the other officers of USCF and its Board.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause a tracking error, which could cause the price of units to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	For example, the current accountability level for investments at any one time in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 7,000.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	While this is not a fixed ceiling, it is a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor, including limiting an investor to holding no more than 7,000 Benchmark Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P76_S3	With regard to position limits, the NYMEX limits an investor from holding more than 1,000 net futures in the last 3 days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX also sets daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	For example, the NYMEX imposes a $0.25 per gallon ($10,500 per contract) price fluctuation limit for the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	This limit is initially based off of the previous trading day s settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If any Benchmark Futures Contract is traded, bid, or offered at the limit for five minutes, trading is halted for five minutes.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S3	When trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be $0.25 per gallon in either direction of that point.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S4	If another halt were triggered, the market would continue to be expanded by $0.25 per gallon in either direction after each successive five-minute trading halt.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P78_S5	There is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Currently, U.S. futures exchanges, including the NYMEX, do not implement fixed position limits for futures contracts held outside of the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	However, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to promulgate rules establishing position limits for futures and options contracts on commodities as well as for swaps that are economically equivalent to futures or options.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	On January 13, 2011, the CFTC proposed new rules, which, if implemented in their proposed form, would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures, including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ( i.e. , certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S3	The CFTC has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S4	At this time, it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S5	The CFTC set position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire, which, under the CFTC s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges, could take effect as early as March 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S6	Based on the CFTC s current proposal, other position limits would not take effect until March 2012 or later.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P79_S7	The effect of this future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for gasoline contracts on the NYMEX, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures or other exchanges that trade listed gasoline futures.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P81_S2	The Futures Contracts available on the ICE Futures are comparable to the contracts on the NYMEX, but they may have different underlying commodities, sizes, deliveries, and prices.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P81_S3	In addition, certain of the Futures Contracts available on the ICE Futures are subject to accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	There are technical and fundamental risks inherent in the trading system USCF employs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	USCF s trading system is quantitative in nature and it is possible that USCF might make a mathematical error.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In addition, it is also possible that a computer or software program may malfunction and cause an error in computation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	To the extent that USCF uses spreads and straddles as part of its trading strategy, there is the risk that the NAV may not closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Spreads combine simultaneous long and short positions in related futures contracts that differ by commodity ( e.g. , long crude oil and short gasoline), by market ( e.g. , long WTI crude futures, short Brent crude futures), or by delivery month ( e.g. , long December, short November).
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Spreads gain or lose value as a result of relative changes in price between the long and short positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Spreads often reduce risk to investors, because the contracts tend to move up or down together.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	However, both legs of the spread could move against an investor simultaneously, in which case the spread would lose value.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Certain types of spreads may face unlimited risk, e.g. , because the price of a futures contract underlying a short position can increase by an unlimited amount and the investor would have to take delivery or offset at that price.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	A commodity straddle takes both long and short option positions in the same commodity in the same market and delivery month simultaneously.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	The buyer of a straddle profits if either the long or the short leg of the straddle moves further than the combined cost of both options.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P87_S2	The seller of a straddle profits if both the long and short positions do not trade beyond a range equal to the combined premium for selling both options.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	If USCF were to utilize a spread or straddle position and the spread performed differently than expected, the results could impact UGA s tracking error.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	This could affect UGA s investment objective of having its NAV closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Additionally, a loss on a spread position would negatively impact UGA s absolute return.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	UGA and USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to maintain UGA s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with UGA s objective of having the value of its units NAV track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P92_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	USCF has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of UGA, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with the best interests of investors.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Limited partners have limited voting control, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amendment of the LP Agreement, change in UGA s basic investment policy, dissolution of this fund, or the sale or distribution of UGA s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	USCF serves as the general partner to each of UGA, USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO and the sponsor for USCI, and will serve as the sponsor for USMI, USAI and USCUI, each of which is a series of the Trust, if such funds offer their securities to the public or begin operations.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	USCF may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for UGA may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	These trading decisions may be influenced since USCF also serves as the general partner or sponsor for all of the funds and is required to meet all of the funds investment objectives as well as UGA s.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If USCF believes that a trading decision it made on behalf of UGA might (i) impede its other funds from reaching their investment objectives, or (ii) improve the likelihood of meeting its other funds objectives, then USCF may choose to change its trading decision for UGA, which could either impede or improve the opportunity for UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In addition, USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of its other funds if the need for indemnification arises.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S4	This potential indemnification will cause USCF s assets to decrease.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P96_S5	If USCF s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification, then USCF may terminate and investors could lose their investment.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Unitholders may only vote on the removal of USCF and limited partners have only limited voting rights.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Unitholders and limited partners will not participate in the management of UGA and do not control USCF so they will not have influence over basic matters that affect UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Unitholders that have not applied to become limited partners have no voting rights, other than to remove USCF as the general partner of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Limited partners will have limited voting rights with respect to UGA s affairs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Unitholders may remove USCF only if 66 2/3% of the unitholders elect to do so.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Unitholders and limited partners will not be permitted to participate in the management or control of UGA or the conduct of its business.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Unitholders and limited partners must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to manage UGA s affairs.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	USCF may manage a large amount of assets and this could affect UGA s ability to trade profitably.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P100_S1	In general, USCF does not intend to limit the amount of assets of UGA that it may manage.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P100_S2	The more assets USCF manages, the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority in interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P102_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P102_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Limited partners may not have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Under Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for UGA obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	A limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of UGA s capital securities representing units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	However, a limited partner may be required to repay to UGA any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Under Delaware law, UGA may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes UGA s liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of UGA s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	With adequate notice, a limited partner may be required to withdraw from the partnership for any reason.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	If USCF gives at least fifteen (15) days written notice to a limited partner, then USCF may for any reason, in its sole discretion, require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P107_S1	USCF may require withdrawal even in situations where the limited partner has complied completely with the provisions of the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	UGA s existing units are, and any units UGA issues in the future will be, subject to restrictions on transfer.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Failure to satisfy these requirements will preclude a transferee from being able to have all the rights of a limited partner.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	No transfer of any unit or interest therein may be made if such transfer would (a) violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the SEC, any state securities commission, the CFTC or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, or (b) cause UGA to be taxable as a corporation or affect UGA s existence or qualification as a limited partnership.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P109_S1	In addition, investors may only become limited partners if they transfer their units to purchasers that meet certain conditions outlined in the LP Agreement, which provides that each record holder or limited partner or unitholder applying to become a limited partner (each a record holder) may be required by USCF to furnish certain information, including that holder s nationality, citizenship or other related status.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P109_S2	A transferee who is not a U.S. resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or a limited partner if its ownership would subject UGA to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of its assets under any federal, state or local law or regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P109_S3	All purchasers of UGA s units, who wish to become limited partners or record holders, and receive cash distributions, if any, or have certain other rights, must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that, among other things, he, she or it agrees to be bound by UGA s LP Agreement and is eligible to purchase UGA s securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P109_S4	Any transfer of units will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by UGA unless a completed transfer application is delivered to USCF or the Administrator.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	A person purchasing UGA s existing units, who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Whether or not a transfer application is received or the consent of USCF obtained, UGA s units will be securities and will be transferable according to the laws governing transfers of securities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P112_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to re-invest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P112_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if it will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g. , at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P112_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P113_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P114_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10%, (including futures commission merchant fees of $3.50 per buy or sell), any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration fees with the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of the units subsequent to the initial offering of the units including the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P114_S1	UGA also pays the fees and expenses, including directors and officers liability insurance, of the independent directors, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, tax accounting and reporting costs, and over-the-counter spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P114_S2	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If offerings of the units do not raise sufficient funds to pay UGA s future expenses and no other source of funding of expenses is found, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Prior to the offering of units that commenced on February 26, 2008, all of UGA s expenses were funded by USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P116_S1	These payments by USCF and its affiliates were designed to allow UGA the ability to commence the public offering of its units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P116_S2	UGA now directly pays certain of these fees and expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P116_S3	USCF will continue to pay other fees and expenses, as set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P116_S4	If USCF and UGA are unable to raise sufficient funds to cover their expenses or locate any other source of funding, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P117_S0	UGA may incur higher fees and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The clearing arrangements between the clearing brokers and UGA generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given UGA notice.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Upon termination, USCF may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if UGA intends to continue trading in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at its present level of capacity.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P118_S2	The services of any clearing broker may not be available, or even if available, these services may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated clearing arrangements.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P119_S0	UGA may miss certain trading opportunities because it will not receive the benefit of the expertise of independent trading advisors.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P120_S0	USCF does not employ trading advisors for UGA; however, it reserves the right to employ them in the future.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P121_S0	The only advisor to UGA is USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P121_S1	A lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to UGA because it will not receive the benefit of a trading advisor s expertise.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P122_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the NAV of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P123_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The financial markets are currently in a period of disruption and UGA does not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Currently and throughout 2008, 2009 and the first half of 2010, the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P125_S1	The conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late 2010, the financial markets are still fragile and could fall into another recession.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Another recession could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of UGA s service providers and Authorized Purchasers which would impact the ability of USCF to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P127_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets; the clearing broker could be subject to proceedings that impair its ability to execute UGA s trades.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P128_S1	If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker if the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P128_S2	In that event, the clearing broker s customers, such as UGA, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P128_S3	The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with the clearing broker; though the vast majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P128_S4	UGA also may be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P129_S0	In addition, to the extent UGA s clearing broker is required to post UGA s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all of the clearing broker s customers.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P129_S1	If UGA s clearing broker defaults to the clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by UGA and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P130_S0	From time to time, the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P130_S1	A clearing broker s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear UGA s trades.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P132_S0	As noted above, the vast majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P132_S1	The insolvency of the custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Third parties may utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P134_S1	USCF has a patent pending for UGA s business method and it is registering its trademarks.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P135_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P135_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, then any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P136_S0	UGA may have difficulty monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P136_S2	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P136_S3	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The success of UGA depends on the ability of USCF to accurately implement trading systems, and any failure to do so could subject UGA to losses on such transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S0	USCF uses mathematical formulas built into a generally available spreadsheet program to decide whether it should buy or sell Gasoline Interests each day.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S1	Specifically, USCF uses the spreadsheet to make mathematical calculations and to monitor positions in Gasoline Interests and Treasuries and correlations to the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S2	USCF must accurately process the spreadsheets outputs and execute the transactions called for by the formulas.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S3	In addition, UGA relies on USCF to properly operate and maintain its computer and communications systems.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S4	Execution of the formulas and operation of the systems are subject to human error.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S5	Any failure, inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the formulas or systems and executing UGA s transactions could impair its ability to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S6	It could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P138_S7	This could cause substantial losses on transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P139_S0	UGA may experience substantial losses on transactions if the computer or communications system fails.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P140_S0	UGA s trading activities, including its risk management, depend on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting them.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P140_S1	Extraordinary transaction volume, hardware or software failure, power or telecommunications failure, a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P140_S2	Any significant degradation or failure of the systems that USCF uses to gather and analyze information, enter orders, process data, monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions, liability to other parties, lost profit opportunities, damages to USCF s and UGA s reputations, increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P141_S0	If the computer and communications systems are not upgraded, UGA s financial condition could be harmed.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P142_S0	The development of complex computer and communications systems and new technologies may render the existing computer and communications systems supporting UGA s trading activities obsolete.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P142_S1	In addition, these computer and communications systems must be compatible with those of third parties, such as the systems of exchanges, clearing brokers and the executing brokers.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P142_S2	As a result, if these third parties upgrade their systems, USCF will need to make corresponding upgrades to continue effectively its trading activities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P143_S0	UGA s future success will depend on UGA s ability to respond to changing technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P144_S0	UGA depends on the reliable performance of the computer and communications systems of third parties, such as brokers and futures exchanges, and may experience substantial losses on transactions if they fail.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S0	UGA depends on the proper and timely function of complex computer and communications systems maintained and operated by the futures exchanges, brokers and other data providers that USCF uses to conduct trading activities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Failure or inadequate performance of any of these systems could adversely affect USCF s ability to complete transactions, including its ability to close out positions, and result in lost profit opportunities and significant losses on commodity interest transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S2	This could have a material adverse effect on revenues and materially reduce UGA s available capital.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S3	For example, unavailability of price quotations from third parties may make it difficult or impossible for USCF to use its proprietary software that it relies upon to conduct its trading activities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S4	Unavailability of records from brokerage firms may make it difficult or impossible for USCF to accurately determine which transactions have been executed or the details, including price and time, of any transaction executed.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P145_S5	This unavailability of information also may make it difficult or impossible for USCF to reconcile its records of transactions with those of another party or to accomplish settlement of executed transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P146_S0	The occurrence of a terrorist attack, or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities could disrupt UGA s trading activity and materially affect UGA s profitability.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P147_S0	The operations of UGA, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which UGA does business, and the markets in which UGA does business could be severely disrupted in the event of a major terrorist attack or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P147_S1	Global anti-terrorism initiatives and political unrest in the Middle East and Southeast Asia continue to fuel this concern.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P148_S0	If USCF permits UGA to become leveraged, investors could lose all or substantially all of their investments if UGA s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interests ) entire market value.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P149_S1	This feature permits commodity pools to leverage their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts (or other commodity interests) with an aggregate value in excess of the commodity pool s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P149_S2	While this leverage can increase the pool s profits, relatively small adverse movements in the price of the pool s futures contracts can cause significant losses to the pool.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P149_S3	While USCF has not and does not currently intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement or otherwise.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P150_S0	The price of gasoline is volatile which could cause large fluctuations in the price of units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Movements in the price of gasoline may be the result of factors outside of USCF s control and may not be anticipated by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P151_S1	Among the factors that can cause volatility in the price of gasoline are:
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P152_S0	the impact of energy conservation efforts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Since UGA s commencement of operations on February 26, 2008, there has been tremendous volatility in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S1	For example, the price of the NYMEX Futures Contract for gasoline started 2010 at $2.0529 per gallon and climbed to a high of $2.4351 on May 3, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S2	Prices reached a low on August 24, 2010 of $1.8093 per gallon.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S3	The NYMEX Futures Contract for gasoline ended 2010 at $2.4303 per gallon, up approximately 18.38% over 2010 (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S4	USCF anticipates that there will be continued volatility in the price of the NYMEX Futures Contract for gasoline and futures contracts for other petroleum-based commodities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P153_S5	Consequently, investors should know that this volatility can lead to a loss of all or substantially all of their investment in UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P154_S0	The impact of environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Since gasoline prices correlate to crude oil prices, law and regulations that affect the price of crude oil impact the price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil wells.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P156_S1	Other laws have prevented exploration and drilling of crude oil in certain environmentally sensitive federal lands and waters.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P156_S2	Several environmental laws that have a direct or an indirect impact on the price of gasoline include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P157_S0	The limited method for transporting and storing gasoline may cause the price of gasoline to increase.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Gasoline is transported throughout the United States by way of pipelines, barges, tankers, trucks and rail cars and is stored in aboveground and underground storage facilities.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P158_S1	These systems may not be adequate to meet demand, especially in times of peak demand or in areas of the United States where gasoline service is already limited due to minimal pipeline and storage infrastructure.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P159_S0	As a result of the limited method for transporting and storing gasoline, the price of gasoline may increase.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Currently, over-the-counter transactions are subject to little regulation.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P161_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade over-the-counter Gasoline Interest contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Over-the-counter contracts are typically traded on a principal-to-principal basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and are essentially unregulated by the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P161_S2	Investors therefore do not receive the protection of CFTC regulation or the statutory scheme of the CEA in connection with this trading activity by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P162_S0	The markets for over-the-counter contracts primarily rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P162_S1	The limited regulation in these markets could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P163_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over-the-counter contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P164_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P164_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P164_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P164_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P165_S0	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P165_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P166_S0	UGA may be subject to liquidity risk with respect to its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Over-the-counter contracts may have terms that make them less marketable than Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P167_S1	Over-the-counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P167_S2	These conditions diminish the ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P167_S3	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over-the-counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P168_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and SEC to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization ( i.e. , uncleared swaps).
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P168_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P168_S2	At this time, the CFTC has proposed a rule addressing this statutory right of certain market participants but has not implemented any rules on this issue and has not implemented any regulations regarding the margin requirements for uncleared swaps.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P170_S0	USCF invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P170_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P171_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P172_S0	The CFTC, NFA and the domestic exchanges have little, if any, regulatory authority over the activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, and have little, if any, power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non-U.S. laws.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P172_S1	Similarly, the rights of market participants, such as UGA, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non-U.S. market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of U.S. markets or brokers.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P172_S2	As a result, in these markets, UGA has less legal and regulatory protection than it does when it trades domestically.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P173_S0	In some of these non-U.S. markets, the performance on a contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes UGA to credit risk.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P173_S1	Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves UGA susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P173_S2	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P173_S3	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P174_S0	International trading activities subject UGA to foreign exchange risk.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P175_S0	The price of any non-U.S. Futures Contract, option on any non-U.S. Futures Contract, or other non-U.S. Other Gasoline-Related Investment, and, therefore, the potential profit and loss on such contract, may be affected by any variance in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the time it is liquidated, offset or exercised.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P175_S1	As a result, changes in the value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar may cause losses to UGA even if the contract traded is profitable.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P176_S0	UGA s international trading could expose it to losses resulting from non-U.S. exchanges that are less developed or less reliable than United States exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P177_S0	Some non-U.S. exchanges may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P177_S1	In addition, UGA may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders, and the historical market data on which USCF bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for U.S. exchanges.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P178_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P179_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P179_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P179_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P179_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its units may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P180_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P181_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its units for a taxable year.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P181_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P182_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to units could be reallocated if the IRS does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P183_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P183_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects unitholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P183_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P183_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P184_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S1	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S2	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S3	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to unitholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S4	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to units, any distributions would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income.
1396878_11_ITEM1A_P185_S5	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in units and could substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.

1396878_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	UGA has not made and does not currently intend to make cash distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	UGA does not purchase units directly from its unitholders; however, in connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Purchasers, UGA redeemed 14 baskets (comprising 1,400,000 units) during the year ended December 31, 2010.

1396878_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the changes in percentage terms of its units NAV to reflect the changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Management believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The regulation of commodity interests in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	On July 21, 2010, a broad financial regulatory reform bill, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, was signed into law that includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy-based and other commodity futures contracts, certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over-the-counter commodity contracts; new registration, recordkeeping, capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	The new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact UGA s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Further, increased regulation of, and the imposition of additional costs on, swap transactions under the new legislation and implementing regulations could cause a reduction in the swap market and the overall derivatives markets, which could restrict liquidity and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	In particular, new position limits imposed on UGA or its counterparties may impact UGA s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective, and new requirements, including capital and mandatory clearing, may increase the cost of UGA s investments and doing business, which could adversely affect UGA s investors.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	On January 13, 2011, the CFTC proposed new rules, which, if implemented in their proposed form, would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures, including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ( i.e. , certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The CFTC has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	At this time, it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	The CFTC s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire, which, under the CFTC s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges, could take effect as early as March 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Based on the CFTC s current proposal, other position limits would not take effect until March 2012 or later.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P8_S5	The effect of this future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	USCF, which is registered as a CPO with the CFTC, is authorized by the LP Agreement to manage UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	USCF is authorized by UGA in its sole judgment to employ and establish the terms of employment for, and termination of, commodity trading advisors or futures commission merchants.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2010 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend punctuated by several pullbacks before exhibiting a general uptrend during the last quarter of the year.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $2.05 per gallon.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Prices rose sharply over the course of the year and hit a peak on May 3, 2010 of $2.44 per gallon.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.43 per gallon, up approximately 18.38% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	UGA s NAV rose during the year from a starting level of $36.41 per unit to a high of $42.06 per unit on December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	UGA s NAV reached its low for the year on August 24, 2010 at $30.41 per unit.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	UGA s NAV on December 31, 2010 was $42.06, up approximately 15.52% over the year.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2010 contract and ended with the February 2011 contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The return of approximately 18.38% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the gasoline futures market exhibited periods of both contango and backwardation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The NAV of UGA s units is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its units on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per unit and issued 300,000 units to the initial Authorized Purchaser, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s units no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 units, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its units: 50,000,000 units which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	As of December 31, 2010, UGA had issued 53,000,000 units, 1,600,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2010, there were 74,700,000 units registered but not yet issued.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	More units may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, units that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Since UGA commenced operations on February 26, 2008, the comparison of UGA s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the period from February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2008 may not be meaningful.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the total unrealized gain on gasoline Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $3,265,416 and UGA established cash deposits, including cash investments in money market funds, that were equal to $63,925,522.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	UGA held 95.98% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and money market funds at the Custodian, while 4.02% of the cash balance was held as margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	The ending per unit NAV on December 31, 2010 was $42.06.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	By comparison, as of December 31, 2009, the total unrealized gain on gasoline Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $5,883,944 and UGA established cash deposits, including cash investments in money market funds, that were equal to $63,237,601.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	UGA held 97.86% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and money market funds at the Custodian, while 2.14% of the cash balance was held as margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	The ending per unit NAV on December 31, 2009 was $36.41.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	The increase in the per unit NAV for December 31, 2010, as compared to December 31, 2009 was primarily a result of the increase in the price of the benchmark futures contract between the year ended December 31, 2009 and the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	By comparison, as of December 31, 2008, the total unrealized gain on Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $1,431,721 and UGA established cash deposits, including cash investments in money market funds, that were equal to $18,806,351.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	UGA held 62.17% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and money market funds at the Custodian, while 37.83% of the cash balance was held as margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	The ending per unit NAV on December 31, 2008 was $20.21.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The increase in the per unit NAV for December 31, 2009, as compared to December 31, 2008 was primarily a result of higher prices for gasoline and the related increase in the value of the gasoline Futures Contracts that UGA had invested in between the year ended December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	UGA pays USCF a management fee of 0.60% of its average net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $71,827,960.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The management fee incurred by UGA during the year amounted to $430,698.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $62,768,546.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The management fee paid by UGA during the year amounted to $376,611.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	By comparison, during the period ended December 31, 2008, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $19,270,440.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	The management fee paid by UGA during the period amounted to $97,932.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	In addition to the management fee, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses, including certain tax reporting costs, licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, ongoing registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The total of these fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $220,232, as compared to $189,295 for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $48,598 for the period ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	The increase in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to UGA s increased size and activity that resulted from its increased size.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA incurred $12,241 in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008, UGA incurred $1,080 and $0, respectively, in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008, an expense waiver was in effect which offset certain of the expenses incurred by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S6	The total amount of the expense waiver was $266,884 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the expenses of UGA, including management fees, commissions, and all other expenses, before allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $918,084, and after allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $651,200.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S8	The total amount of the expense waiver for the year ended December 31, 2009 and for the period ended December 31, 2008 was $256,355 and $126,348, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P24_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008, the expenses of UGA, including management fees, commissions, and all other expenses, before allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $822,261 and $272,878, respectively, and after allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $565,906 and $146,530, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance of USCF and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF who are also USCF s audit committee members.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	UGA shares these fees and expenses with USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to a total of $1,107,140 for all funds other than USCI, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $15,803.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009, these fees and expenses amounted to a total of $433,046 for all funds, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $3,734.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of directors and officers liability insurance coverage and the incurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Effective as of March 3, 2009, USCF obtained directors and officers liability insurance covering all of the directors and officers of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Previously, USCF did not have liability insurance for its directors and officers; instead, the independent directors received a payment in lieu of directors and officers liability insurance coverage.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Effective as of April 1, 2010, UGA also became responsible for paying its portion of any payments that may become due to the independent directors pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements entered into between the independent directors, USCF and UGA, USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	By comparison, for the period ended December 31, 2008, these fees and expenses amounted to a total of $282,000 for all funds, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $2,759.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the period ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to payment for directors and officers liability insurance and an increase in the compensation awarded to the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	As described above, effective as of March 3, 2009, USCF obtained directors and officers liability insurance covering all of the directors and officers of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Previously, USCF did not have liability insurance for its directors and officers; instead, the independent directors received a payment in lieu of directors and officers liability insurance coverage.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or Treasuries.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, total commissions paid to brokers amounted to $67,294.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008, total commissions paid to brokers amounted to $74,584 and $16,173, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	The decrease in the total commissions paid to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily a function of decreased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	The decrease in activity required UGA to trade a lesser number of futures contracts and incur a lower amount of commissions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	The increase in the total commissions paid to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily a function of the increase in UGA s average total net assets, increased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2009 and the reporting period being longer than the comparison period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S6	The increase in assets required UGA to purchase a greater number of Futures Contracts and incur a larger amount of commissions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S7	As an annualized percentage of total net assets, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2010 represents approximately 0.09% of total net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S8	By comparison, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2009 represented approximately 0.12% of total net assets and the figure for the period ended December 31, 2008 represented approximately 0.10% of total net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P30_S9	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	These costs are estimated to be $280,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA earned $31,732 in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S6	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.04%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S7	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the year ended December 31, 2010 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S8	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008, UGA earned $94,681 and $270,986, respectively, in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S9	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.15% and 1.66%, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S10	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the year ended December 31, 2009 or during the period ended December 31, 2008 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during these time periods.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S11	Interest rates on short-term investments, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were lower during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P32_S12	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of total net assets was lower during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $61,818,014.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The management fee incurred by UGA during the period amounted to $93,489.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2009, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $66,567,924.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	The management fee paid by UGA during the period amounted to $100,672.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S4	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the daily average total net assets of UGA were $10,660,237.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P33_S5	The management fee paid by UGA during the period amounted to $16,078.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In addition to the management fee, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses, including certain tax reporting costs, licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, ongoing registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The total of these fees and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2010 was $44,662, as compared to $48,620 for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and $7,656 for the three months ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	The decrease in expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to lower expenses, including decreased brokerage fees, decreased licensing fees and decreased tax reporting costs due to the lesser number of unitholders during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to higher expenses, including increased brokerage fees, increased licensing fees and increased tax reporting costs due to the greater number of unitholders during the three months ended December 31, 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	For the three months ended December 31, 2010, UGA incurred $2,300 in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S5	For the three months ended December 31, 2009, UGA incurred $1,080 in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S6	UGA did not incur any fees or other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units for the three months ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S7	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, an expense waiver was in effect which offset certain of the expenses incurred by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S8	The total amount of the expense waiver was $52,143.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S9	For the three months ended December 31, 2010, the expenses of UGA, including management fees, commissions, and all other expenses, before allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $190,294 and after allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $138,151.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S10	The total amount of the expense waiver for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $213,152 and $80,363, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P34_S11	For the three months ended December 31, 2009 and the three months ended December 31, 2008, the expenses of UGA, including management fees, commissions, and all other expenses, before allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $362,444 and $104,097, respectively, and after allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $149,292 and $23,734, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance of USCF and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF who are also USCF s audit committee members.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	UGA shares these fees and expenses with USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to a total of $1,107,140 for all funds other than USCI, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $15,803.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or Treasuries.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, total commissions paid to brokers amounted to $12,686.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, total commissions paid to brokers amounted to $17,282 and $5,423, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	The decrease in the total commissions paid to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009 was primarily a function of decreased redemption and creation activity during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	The decrease in activity required UGA to trade a lesser number of futures contracts and incur a lower amount of commissions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	The increase in the total commissions paid to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily a function of the increase in UGA s average total net assets and increased redemptions and creations during the three months ended December 31, 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S6	The increase activity required UGA to trade a greater number of futures contracts and incur a larger amount of commissions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S7	As an annualized percentage of total net assets, the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2010 represents approximately 0.08% of total net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S8	By comparison, the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2009 represented approximately 0.10% of total net assets and the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2008 represented approximately 0.20% of total net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P36_S9	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	For the three months ended December 31, 2010, UGA earned $7,637 in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.05%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2010 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S8	By comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, UGA earned $9,118 and $23,244, respectively, in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S9	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.05% and 0.87%, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S10	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2009 or 2008 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during these time periods.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S11	Interest rates on short-term investments, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were lower during the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P38_S12	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of total net assets remained flat during the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009 and was lower during the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	UGA s management seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that changes in its average daily NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the changes in the average daily price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, UGA s management would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	Management believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2010, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.504%, while the simple average daily change in the NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.501%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The average daily difference was -0.003% (or -0.3 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the NAV was -0.643%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract since inception.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Since the commencement of the offering of UGA units to the public on February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2010, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was -0.019%, while the simple average daily change in the NAV of UGA over the same time period was -0.017%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The average daily difference was -0.002% (or -0.2 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the NAV was -0.472%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its NAV, versus the expected changes in its NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its NAV was 15.52%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	This is based on an initial NAV of $36.41 on December 31, 2009 and an ending NAV as of December 31, 2010 of $42.06.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated NAV of $42.42 as of December 31, 2010, for a total return over the relevant time period of 16.51%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	The difference between the actual NAV total return of UGA of 15.52% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 16.51% was an error over the time period of 0.99%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	Management believes that a portion of the difference between the actual return and the expected benchmark return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA received dividend and interest income of $31,732, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 0.04% for such period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA also collected $16,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual return.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	However, if the total assets of UGA continue to increase, management believes that the impact on total returns of these fees from creations and redemptions will diminish as a percentage of the total return.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA incurred net expenses of $651,200.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(603,468), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of -0.84% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its NAV was 80.16%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	This was based on an initial NAV of $20.21 on December 31, 2008 and an ending NAV as of December 31, 2009 of $36.41.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated NAV of $36.74 as of December 31, 2009, for a total return over the relevant time period of 81.79%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	The difference between the actual NAV total return of UGA of 80.16% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 81.79% was an error over the time period of -1.63%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	Management believes that a portion of the difference between the actual return and the expected benchmark return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA received dividend and interest income of $94,681, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 0.15% for such period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA also collected $29,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual return.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, if the total assets of UGA continue to increase, management believes that the impact on total returns of these fees from creations and redemptions will diminish as a percentage of the total return.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA incurred net expenses of $565,906.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(442,225), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of -0.70% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	By comparison, for the period ended December 31, 2008, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its NAV was -59.58%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	This was based on an initial NAV of $50.00 on February 26, 2008 and an ending NAV as of December 31, 2008 of $20.21.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated NAV of $20.09 as of December 31, 2008, for a total return over the relevant time period of -59.81%.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	The difference between the actual NAV total return of UGA of -59.58% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of -59.81% was an error over the time period of 0.23%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return exceeded the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P50_S5	Management believes that a portion of the difference between the actual return and the expected benchmark return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	During the period ended December 31, 2008, UGA received dividend and interest income of $270,986, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 1.66% for such period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, during the period ended December 31, 2008, UGA also collected $10,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual return.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	During the period ended December 31, 2008, UGA incurred net expenses of $146,530.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $134,456, which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of 0.82% for the period ended December 31, 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	In 2010, management attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Second, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its unitholders and did not make any distributions to unitholders in 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA earned, on an annualized basis, approximately 0.04% on its cash holdings.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S5	It also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of 0.60% for management fees and approximately 0.09% in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts, and 0.21% for other expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P54_S6	The foregoing fees and expenses resulted in a net yield on an annualized basis of approximately (0.86)% and affected UGA s ability to track its benchmark.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2.00 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.00.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	In this example, the value of the $2.00 investment would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen to $2.50 after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the futures contract would have risen to $2.60, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen to $1.50 while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen to only $1.60.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P61_S5	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	In this example, it would mean that the value of the $2.00 investment would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen to $2.50 after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the futures contract will have risen to only $2.40, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S4	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen to $1.50 while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen to $1.40.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P62_S5	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years (2001-2010).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P63_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between 2001 and 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Investors will further note that the markets display a very seasonal pattern that corresponds to the seasonal demand patterns for gasoline mentioned above.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	That is, in many, but not all cases, the price of the near month is higher than the next month during the middle of the summer months as the price of gasoline for delivery in those summer months rises to meet peak demand.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	At the same time, the price of the near month contract, when that month is just before the onset of spring, does not rise as far or as fast as the price of a next month contract whose delivery falls closer to the start of the summer season.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its units match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA units during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	For example, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2009 and held to December 31, 2010 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by 15.52%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 18.38% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2008 and held to December 31, 2009 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by 80.16%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 81.79% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	By comparison, an investment in UGA units made on February 26, 2008 and held to December 31, 2008 decreased, based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by -59.58%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period decreased by -59.81% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the percentage changes in its per unit NAV track the percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the percentage changes in price of both UGA s units and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was impacted by several factors.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2010 at $2.053 per gallon.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	It rose over the course of the year and hit a peak on May 3, 2010 of $2.4351 per gallon.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.4303 per gallon, up approximately 18.38% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the price of the NYMEX front month crude oil future, the raw material from which gasoline is refined, rose approximately 15.15% from approximately $79.36 per barrel to approximately $91.38 per barrel.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	The price of crude oil was volatile and was influenced by several factors.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The dollar, the currency by which crude oil is priced, declined relative to other global currencies causing investors to seek to hedge perceived inflation by investing in commodities.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	On the consumption side, demand increased inside and outside the United States as global economic growth, including emerging economies such as China and India, improved during 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	On the supply side, efforts to reduce production by OPEC to more closely match global consumption were partially successful.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	Crude oil prices finished 2010 approximately 15.15% higher than at the beginning of the year.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	Management believes, however, that should the global economic situation cease to improve, or decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Management believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P73_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicating that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P75_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively or negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P75_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	For the ten year time period between 2000 and 2010, the chart below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of unleaded gasoline on a monthly basis was not strongly correlated, positively or negatively, with the movements of large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds or global equities.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	However, movements in unleaded gasoline had a strong positive correlation to movements in crude oil and heating oil.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	Finally, unleaded gasoline had a positive, but weak, correlation with natural gas.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The chart below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above chart.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2010, unleaded gasoline continued to have a strong positive correlation with crude oil and heating oil.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	During this period, it also had no correlation with the movements of natural gas.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	The correlation between unleaded gasoline and both large cap U.S. equities and global equities, which had been essentially non-correlated over the prior ten year period ended December 31, 2010, had a positive correlation over the one-year period ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	Finally, the results showed that unleaded gasoline and U.S. government bonds, which had essentially been non-correlated for the prior ten year period, were negatively correlated over this more recent time period.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contracts then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming units, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its over-the-counter contracts, and, except as noted below, payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	The balance of the net assets is held in UGA s account at the Custodian.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S5	Income received from UGA s money market funds is paid to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P85_S7	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P86_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA was not forced to purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	Since the initial offering of units, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including certain tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of the Marketing Agent, the Administrator and the Custodian and offering expenses relating to the initial offering of units.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P87_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P88_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	UBS Securities, UGA s commodity broker, or any other broker that may be retained by UGA in the future, when acting as UGA s futures commission merchant in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	These futures commission merchants are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases over-the-counter contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2010, UGA had deposits in domestic and foreign financial institutions, including cash investments in money market funds, in the amount of $63,925,522.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	This amount is subject to loss should these institutions cease operations.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	As of December 31, 2010, UGA has no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem units, which redemptions must be in blocks of 100,000 units called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of units being redeemed.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its units with the SEC, FINRA and the AMEX, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of units, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional units of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of the Custodian and transfer agent, BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC and CFTC reports.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the affiliated funds managed by USCF, other than USBO and USCI, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements with the exception of certain initial implementation service fees and base service fees which are borne by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	USCF, though under no obligation to do so, agreed to pay certain costs for tax reporting and audit expenses normally borne by UGA to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to a futures commission merchant), over-the-counter dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Commission payments to a futures commission merchant are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2010, UGA s portfolio consisted of 660 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In the future, UGA may purchase over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an over-the-counter contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Some gasoline-based derivatives transactions contain fairly generic terms and conditions and are available from a wide range of participants.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Other gasoline-based derivatives have highly customized terms and conditions and are not as widely available.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Many of these over-the-counter contracts are cash-settled forwards for the future delivery of gasoline- or petroleum-based fuels that have terms similar to the Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Others take the form of swaps in which the two parties exchange cash flows based on pre-determined formulas tied to the spot price of gasoline, forward gasoline prices or gasoline futures prices.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P2_S4	For example, UGA may enter into over-the-counter derivative contracts whose value will be tied to changes in the difference between the spot price of gasoline, the price of Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and the prices of other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To protect itself from the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA may enter into agreements with each counterparty that provide for the netting of its overall exposure to such counterparty, such as the agreements published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	UGA also may require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support to address UGA s exposure to the counterparty.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	In addition, it is also possible for UGA and its counterparty to agree to clear their transactions under the agreement through an established futures clearinghouse such as those connected to the NYMEX or the ICE Futures.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	In that event, UGA would no longer bear the credit risk of its original counterparty, as the clearinghouse would now be UGA s counterparty.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P3_S4	UGA would still retain any price risk associated with its transaction and would be required to deposit margin to secure the clearinghouse s exposure to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The creditworthiness of each potential counterparty is assessed by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into over-the-counter contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Any entity acting as counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Over-the-counter contracts may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The effect of holding such combined positions is to adjust the sensitivity of UGA to changes in the price relationship between futures contracts which will expire sooner and those that will expire later.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P7_S3	UGA would use such a spread if USCF felt that taking such long and short positions, when combined with the rest of its holdings, would more closely track the investment goals of UGA, or if USCF felt it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	UGA would enter into a straddle when it chooses to take an option position consisting of a long (or short) position in both a call option and put option.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The economic effect of holding certain combinations of put options and call options can be very similar to that of owning the underlying futures contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	UGA would make use of such a straddle approach if, in the opinion of USCF, the resulting combination would more closely track the investment goals of UGA or if it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in gasoline prices.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA did not employ any hedging methods such as those described above since all of its investments were made over an exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Therefore, during such period, UGA was not exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	UGA s management assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, UGA s management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, its internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Gasoline Fund LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	The Fund s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P4_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, of the Fund and our report dated March 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1396878_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1396878_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the changes in percentage terms of its units net asset value to reflect the changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB ) for delivery to the New York harbor as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2010, UGA held 660 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ) is responsible for the management of UGA.

1396878_11_ITEM8_P32_S3	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in UGA recording a tax liability that reduces net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P32_S4	However, UGA s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	UGA recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax fees payable, if assessed.

1396878_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	UGA receives or pays the proceeds from units sold or redeemed within three business days after the trade date of the purchase or redemption.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The amounts due from Authorized Purchasers are reflected in UGA s statement of financial condition as receivable for units sold, and amounts payable to Authorized Purchasers upon redemption are reflected as payable for units redeemed.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Profit or loss shall be allocated among the partners of UGA in proportion to the number of units each partner holds as of the close of each month.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	USCF may revise, alter or otherwise modify this method of allocation as described in the LP Agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	UGA s net asset value is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing the amount by the total number of units issued and outstanding.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Net income (loss) per unit is the difference between the net asset value per unit at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	The weighted average number of units outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average unit.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	The weighted average units are equal to the number of units outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for units redeemed based on the amount of time the units were outstanding during such period.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	There were no units held by USCF at December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Offering costs incurred in connection with the registration of additional units after the initial registration of units are borne by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	These costs include registration fees paid to regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offerings.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	These costs are accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter period if warranted.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Cash equivalents include money market funds and overnight deposits or time deposits with original maturity dates of three months or less.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Certain amounts in the accompanying financial statements were reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires UGA s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Under the LP Agreement, USCF is responsible for investing the assets of UGA in accordance with the objectives and policies of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	In addition, USCF has arranged for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custody, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	For these services, UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a fee, which is paid monthly, equal to 0.60% per annum of average daily net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	UGA pays all costs and expenses associated with the ongoing registration of its units subsequent to the initial offering.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	These costs include registration or other fees paid to regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offer and sale.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, UGA incurred $12,241, $1,080 and $0, respectively, in registration fees and other offering expenses.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance of USCF and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF who are also USCF s audit committee members.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Effective as of April 1, 2010, UGA is responsible for paying its portion of any payments that may become due to the independent directors pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements entered into between the independent directors, USCF and each of the affiliated funds.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	UGA shares all director fees and expenses, including any that may become due pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements, with USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO, based on the relative assets of each fund, computed on a daily basis.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to a total of $1,107,140 for USOF, USNG, US12OF, UGA, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $15,802.79.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P45_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, these fees and expenses were $433,046 and $282,000, respectively, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $3,734 and $2,759, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	As discussed in Note 4 below, UGA entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX on May 30, 2007.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, UGA and the affiliated funds managed by USCF, other than USBO and USCI, pay a licensing fee that is equal to 0.04% for the first $1,000,000,000 of combined assets of the funds and 0.02% for combined assets above $1,000,000,000.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, UGA incurred $17,153, $14,846 and $5,219, respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	These costs were approximately $280,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	USCF, though under no obligation to do so, agreed to pay certain expenses, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2011.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	The above fee does not include the following expenses, which are also borne by USCF: the cost of placing advertisements in various periodicals; web construction and development; or the printing and production of various marketing materials.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P51_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the affiliated funds managed by USCF, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	an asset-based charge of: (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s and USCI s combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s and USCI s combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s and USCI s combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P52_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P52_S4	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7.00 to $15.00 per transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	UGA has entered into a brokerage agreement with UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	The agreement requires UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	In accordance with the agreement, UBS Securities charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	On May 30, 2007, UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the affiliated funds managed by USCF, other than USBO and USCI, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts and options on futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires a futures commission merchant to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the futures commission merchant s proprietary activities.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Through December 31, 2010, all of the futures contracts held by UGA were exchange-traded.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P63_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as U.S. Treasuries, deposited with a futures commission merchant are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the futures commission merchant s segregation requirements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	In the event of a futures commission merchant s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P65_S3	The insolvency of a futures commission merchant could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that futures commission merchant; however, the vast majority of UGA s assets are held in U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of a futures commission merchant.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P65_S4	Also, the failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in these money market funds.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, UGA had deposits in domestic and foreign financial institutions, including cash investments in money market funds, in the amounts of $63,925,522 and $63,237,601, respectively.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	This amount is subject to loss should these institutions cease operations.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statement of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following table presents per unit performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	An individual unitholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2010 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no significant transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of USOF s securities at December 31, 2009 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, there were no significant transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ), which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2010-06 Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASU No. 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure and requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, entities will need to disclose information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 securities on a gross basis, rather than as a net number as currently required.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P85_S3	The implementation of ASU No. 2010-06 is not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial statement disclosures.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	UGA has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
1396878_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	This evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	UGA maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in UGA s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of UGA if UGA had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UGA s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UGA have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	UGA is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	UGA s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of USCF regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1396878_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth above under the heading, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

1396878_11_ITEM10_P47_S1	The Board s responsibilities include: (i) the selection, evaluation, retention and succession of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the selection and performance of other executive officers, (ii) understanding, reviewing and monitoring the implementation of strategic plans, annual operating plans and budgets, (iii) the selection and oversight of UGA s independent auditors and the oversight of UGA s financial statements, (iv) advising management on significant issues, (v) the review and approval of significant company actions and certain other matters, (vi) nominating directors and committee members and overseeing effective corporate governance and (vii) the consideration of other constituencies, such as USCF s and UGA s customers, employees, suppliers and the communities impacted by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P47_S2	The non-management directors have designated Malcolm R. Fobes III as the presiding independent director.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P47_S3	Mr. Fobes role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P48_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF, including investing in the futures contracts and other commodity interests in order to track the benchmark futures contracts of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P48_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading the discussion and execution of new strategic objectives.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P49_S0	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P49_S1	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P49_S2	The Board believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer facilitates information flow between management and the Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as over-the-counter swap contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P50_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P51_S0	The Board tasks management with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P52_S0	The Board also determines compensation payable to employees of USCF, including the portfolio managers of each of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P52_S1	The compensation of certain employees of USCF is, in part, based on the amount of assets under management by UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P52_S2	The Board feels that compensating certain employees, in part, based on the amount of assets under management is appropriate since having more assets in a fund generally reflects that investors perceive the fund s investment objective is being met.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in over-the-counter swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including over-the-counter swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any over-the-counter swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P53_S5	In making compensation decisions, the Board considers whether a compensation arrangement would expose UGA or the Related Public Funds to additional risks and whether the risks posed by such arrangement are consistent with the best interests of UGA s investors.
1396878_11_ITEM10_P54_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P0_S0	UGA does not directly compensate any of the executive officers noted above.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P0_S3	UGA pays fees to USCF pursuant to the LP Agreement under which it is obligated to pay USCF an annualized fee of 0.60% of its average daily net assets.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P0_S4	For 2010, UGA paid USCF aggregate management fees of $430,968.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following table sets forth compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2010, by the directors of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	UGA s portion of the aggregate fees paid to the directors for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4,519.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	Mr. Fobes serves as chairman of the audit committee of USCF and receives additional compensation in recognition of the additional responsibilities he has undertaken in this role.
1396878_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	Amounts accrued for each independent director pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements between the independent directors, USCF and UGA, USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO.
1396878_11_ITEM12_P0_S0	None of the directors or executive officers of USCF, nor the employees of UGA own any units of UGA.
1396878_11_ITEM12_P0_S1	In addition, UGA is not aware of any 5% holder of its units.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P0_S0	UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P0_S1	However, there have been no direct financial transactions between UGA and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P1_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction with a related person that must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K item 404(a), including financial transactions by UGA with directors or executive officers of USCF or holders of beneficial interests in USCF or UGA of more than 5%, will be subject to the provisions regarding Resolutions of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care as set forth in Section 7.7 of the LP Agreement and will be reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the Board of USCF.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2011, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_11_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_11_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
1396878_11_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for (i) the audit of UGA s annual financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and certain of UGA s current reports on Form 8-K; (ii) the audit of UGA s internal control over financial reporting included in the annual report on Form 10-K; and (iii) services that are normally provided by the Independent Registered Public Accountants in connection with statutory and regulatory filings of registration statements.
1396878_11_ITEM14_P2_S0	Tax fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and partnership income tax return filings.
1396878_11_ITEM14_P3_S0	The audit committee has established policies and procedures which are intended to control the services provided by UGA s independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence.
1396878_11_ITEM14_P3_S1	Under these policies and procedures, no audit or permitted non-audit services (including fees and terms thereof), except for the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, may be undertaken by UGA s independent auditors unless the engagement is specifically pre-approved by the audit committee.
1396878_11_ITEM14_P4_S0	The audit committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals must be presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P1_S0	No financial statement schedules are filed herewith because (i) such schedules are not required or (ii) the information required has been presented in the aforementioned financial statements.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P2_S0	Exhibits required to be filed by Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	Finally, you should know that this Code is designed to satisfy the standards contained in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	U.S. federal courts are bound to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations when sentencing companies convicted of federal offenses arising from the illegal acts of one or more employees.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P10_S2	The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations provide for substantial leniency in sentencing of a company from otherwise severe mandatory penalties, where the company had in effect an adequate compliance program at the time of the illegal activity.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	A conflict exists when your personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:
1396878_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another s personal benefit.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when the opportunity to do so presents itself.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	You must not trade the units of any Fund, or the securities of our affiliates, our service providers, or any of our other business partners while in the possession of inside information.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against unitholders.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	No false or artificial entries may be made.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	No funds of the Company, of the Trust or of any Fund may be given directly to political candidates.

1396878_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the Report ) of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Registrant ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof, I, Nicholas D. Gerber, the President and Chief Executive Officer of United States Commodity Funds LLC, General Partner of the Registrant, hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge, that:
1396878_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrant.
1396878_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the Report ) of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Registrant ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof, I, Howard Mah, the Chief Financial Officer of United States Commodity Funds LLC, General Partner of the Registrant, hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge, that:
1396878_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrant.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Associated With Investing Directly or Indirectly in Gasoline Investing in Gasoline Interests subjects UGA to the risks of the gasoline industry and this could result in large fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	UGA is subject to the risks and hazards of the gasoline industry because it invests in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks and hazards that are inherent in the gasoline industry may cause the price of gasoline to widely fluctuate.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If the changes in percentage terms of UGA s units accurately track the changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price of gasoline, then the price of its units may also fluctuate.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The exploration for crude oil, the raw material used in the production of gasoline, and production of gasoline are uncertain processes with many risks.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells for crude oil is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production of gasoline, including:
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing activities involve numerous risks that may affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	There are a variety of hazards inherent in gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing, such as leaks, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes and flooding), pipeline failure, abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, and other hazards which could affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	To the extent these hazards limit the supply or delivery of gasoline, gasoline prices will increase.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The price of gasoline fluctuates on a seasonal basis and this would result in fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	For example, during the winter months the heating season can have a major impact on prices in the fuel industry.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	During the summer months, people are more likely to travel by automobile when taking spring and summer vacations along with weekend trips.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	The increase in travel drives fuel demand and gasoline prices typically follow.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Refineries usually use the spring months for major routine maintenance and to retool for summer gasoline blends required in various parts of the country to meet air emission requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Refinery maintenance as well as unplanned shut-downs reduce gasoline production.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Depending on inventory levels and the strength of gasoline demand, this situation may put pressure on prices until additional gasoline supplies can be imported.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Supply interruptions may also affect inventories.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 had a major impact on energy-producing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, where roughly one-third of oil production in the United States occurs.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the effects remain as repairs are continuing at some production and pipeline facilities that were severely damaged.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Changes in the political climate could have negative consequences for gasoline prices.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Tensions with Iran, the world s fourth largest oil exporter, could put oil exports in jeopardy.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Other global concerns include civil unrest and sabotage affecting the flow of oil from Nigeria, a large oil exporter.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Meanwhile, friction continues between the governments of the United States and Venezuela, a major exporter of oil to the United States.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Additionally, a series of production cuts by members of OPEC followed by a refusal to subsequently increase oil production have tightened world oil markets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Limitations on ability to develop additional sources of oil could impact future prices of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In the past, a supply disruption in one area of the world was softened by the ability of major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia to increase output to make up the difference.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Now, much of that spare reserve capacity has been absorbed by increased demand.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The current global economic downturn, however, has led to a decrease in the demand for oil that lasted through 2009 and a corresponding increase in spare capacities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	According to the United States Government s Energy Information Administration, global oil demand is expected to rise by 2 million barrels a day in 2012, to a total global consumption of 90 million barrels per day, up from 88 million barrels per day in 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Gasoline refinement and production is subject to government regulations which could have an impact on the price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Gasoline refinement and production in North America are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various state regulatory agencies.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, as a result of changes in fuel specifications, United States refiners in the spring and summer of 2006 began phasing out the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) and replacing it with ethanol.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The switch to ethanol, which is mandated by federal law, has resulted in a tightened supply and higher prices for this grain-based product.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Although increased use of ethanol is expected to bring environmental benefits, ethanol adds to gasoline production costs because it currently is more expensive than the MTBE it is replacing.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Various formulations and compositions of gasoline as may be required by different state environmental laws and/or the U.S. Government may impact the price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Some areas of the country are required to use special formulations of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Environmental programs, aimed at reducing carbon monoxide, smog, and air toxics, include the Federal and/or state-required oxygenated, reformulated, and low-volatility (evaporates more slowly) gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Other environmental programs put restrictions on transportation and storage.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The reformulated gasoline required in some urban areas and in California cost more to produce than conventional gasoline served elsewhere, increasing the price paid at the pump.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Changing standards in the future may further impact the price of gasoline in this regard.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV may not correlate with daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If this were to occur, investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets as fully as possible in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit NAV closely correlate with the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	However, daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV may not correlate with the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for several reasons as set forth below:
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	UGA (i) may not be able to buy/sell the exact amount of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with the per unit NAV; (ii) may not always be able to buy and sell Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at the market price; and (iii) is required to pay fees, including brokerage fees and the management fee, which will have an effect on the correlation.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Short-term supply and demand for gasoline may cause the changes in the market price of the Benchmark Futures Contract to vary from the changes in UGA s per unit NAV if UGA has fully invested in Futures Contracts that do not reflect such supply and demand and it is unable to replace such contracts with Futures Contracts that do reflect such supply and demand.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	UGA sells and buys only as many Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that it can to get the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit NAV as close as possible to the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The remainder of its assets are invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents and are used to satisfy initial margin and additional margin requirements, if any, and to otherwise support its investments in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents, both directly and as margin, provide rates of return that vary from changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, because UGA incurs certain expenses in connection with its investment activities, and holds most of its assets in more liquid short-term securities for margin and other liquidity purposes and for redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis, USCF is generally not able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments and there cannot be perfect correlation between changes in UGA s per unit NAV and changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As UGA grows, there may be more or less correlation.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, if UGA only has enough money to buy three Futures Contracts and it needs to buy four contracts to track the price of gasoline then the correlation will be lower, but if it buys 20,000 Futures Contracts and it needs to buy 20,001 contracts then the correlation will be higher.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	At certain asset levels, UGA may be limited in its ability to purchase the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments due to accountability levels imposed by the relevant exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	To the extent that UGA invests in these other Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract may be lower.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If UGA is required to invest in other Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are less correlated with the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would likely invest in over-the-counter contracts to increase the level of correlation of UGA s assets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Over-the-counter contracts entail certain risks described below under Over-the-Counter Contract Risk.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	UGA may not be able to buy the exact number of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract if the purchase price of Futures Contracts required to be fully invested in such contracts is higher than the proceeds received for the sale of a Creation Basket on the day the basket was sold.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In such case, UGA could not invest the entire proceeds from the purchase of the Creation Basket in such futures contracts (for example, assume UGA receives $4,000,000 for the sale of a Creation Basket and assume that the price of a Futures Contract for gasoline is $59,950, then UGA could only invest in only 66 Futures Contracts with an aggregate value of $3,956,700), UGA would be required to invest a percentage of the proceeds in cash, Treasuries or other liquid securities to be deposited as margin with the futures commission merchant through which the contracts were purchased.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The remainder of the purchase price for the Creation Basket would remain invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents or other liquid securities as determined by USCF from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If the trading market for Futures Contracts is suspended or closed, UGA may not be able to purchase these investments at the last reported price.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV do not correlate with daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, then investing in UGA may not be an effective way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with the spot price of gasoline and this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If this were to occur, then investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S7	In addition, the price relationship between the near month contract and the next month contract that compose the Benchmark Futures Contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of UGA s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total return tracks to other gasoline price indices total returns.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S8	When using the Benchmark Futures Contract as a strategy to track the spot price of gasoline, at best the correlation between changes in prices of such Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline can be only approximate.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for such Gasoline Interests and technical influences in futures trading.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S10	If there is a weak correlation between the Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline, then, even in situations where there is also tracking among the prices of units, the per unit NAV and Gasoline Interests, the price of units may not accurately track the spot price of gasoline and investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when the near month contract is sold and replaced with the next month contract to expire.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result, the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track higher.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Conversely, in the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	As a result the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track lower.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of UGA s per unit NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, this could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per unit NAV and total return.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	UGA may experience a loss if it is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The value of Treasuries generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If UGA is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired, UGA will experience a loss.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	This loss may adversely impact the price of the units and may decrease the correlation among the price of units, the per unit NAV of units, the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	UGA may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market in its currency, its gasoline production or exports, or in another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Alternatively, limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and daily price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Unexpected market illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, UGA has not and does not intend at this time to establish a credit facility, which would provide an additional source of liquidity and instead relies only on the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it holds.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The anticipated large value of the positions in Futures Contracts that USCF will acquire or enter into for UGA increases the risk of illiquidity.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Other Gasoline-Related Investments that UGA invests in, such as negotiated over-the-counter contracts, may have a greater likelihood of being illiquid since they are contracts between two parties that take into account not only market risk, but also the relative credit, tax, and settlement risks under such contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Such contracts also have limited transferability that results from such risks and from the contract s express limitations.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA s Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If the nature of hedgers and speculators in futures markets has shifted such that gasoline purchasers are the predominant hedgers in the market, UGA might have to reinvest at higher futures prices or choose Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The changing nature of the hedgers and speculators in the gasoline market influences whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In order to induce speculators to take the corresponding long side of the same futures contract, gasoline producers must generally be willing to sell futures contracts at prices that are below expected future spot prices.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Conversely, if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the gasoline who purchase futures contracts to hedge against a rise in prices, then speculators will only take the short side of the futures contract if the futures price is greater than the expected future spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P28_S8	This can have significant implications for UGA when it is time to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing Futures Contract into a new Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	While UGA does not intend to take physical delivery of gasoline under its Futures Contracts, physical delivery under such contracts impacts the value of the contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While it is not the current intention of UGA to take physical delivery of gasoline under any of its Futures Contracts, futures contracts are not required to be cash-settled and it is possible to take delivery under some of these contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Storage costs associated with purchasing gasoline could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Storage costs include the time value of money invested in gasoline as a physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the gasoline less any benefits from ownership of gasoline that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In general, Futures Contracts have a one-month delay for contract delivery and the back month (the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month) includes storage costs.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	To the extent that these storage costs change for gasoline while UGA holds Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the value of the Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and therefore UGA s NAV, may change as well.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in UGA or the ability of UGA to continue to implement its investment strategy.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K. Investing in UGA for purposes of hedging may be subject to several risks including the possibility of losing the benefit of favorable market movement.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Participants in the gasoline or in other industries may use UGA as a vehicle to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	There are several risks in connection with using UGA as a hedging device.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	While hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices, it can also preclude a hedger s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In a hedging transaction, the hedger may be concerned that the hedged item will increase in price, but must recognize the risk that the price may instead decline and if this happens he will have lost his opportunity to profit from the change in price because the hedging transaction will result in a loss rather than a gain.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Thus, the hedger foregoes the opportunity to profit from favorable price movements.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on gasoline prices and gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There is no historic evidence that the spot price of gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	UGA s Operating Risks UGA is not a registered investment company so unitholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage trading activities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. Howard Mah and John Hyland.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If Messrs. Mah or Hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Furthermore, Messrs. Mah and Hyland are currently involved in the management of the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	USCF has also filed registration statements to register units of USSF, UNGD, USGO and USABF, each a series of the United States Commodity Funds Trust I. Mr. Mah is also employed by Ameristock Corporation, a registered investment adviser that manages a public mutual fund.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	It is estimated that Mr. Mah will spend approximately 90% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Mr. Hyland will spend approximately 100% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P44_S7	To the extent that USCF establishes additional funds, even greater demands will be placed on Messrs. Mah and Hyland, as well as the other officers of USCF and its Board.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause a tracking error, which could cause the price of units to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX also sets daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Additionally, on October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted new rules, which establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures contracts including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts, executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets (i.e., certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S5	The CFTC also adopted aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S6	For a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the CFTC under the Dodd-Frank Act and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Business What are Futures Contracts? and Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K. All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P46_S8	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures or other exchanges that trade listed gasoline futures.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The Futures Contracts available on the ICE Futures are comparable to the contracts on the NYMEX, but they may have different underlying commodities, sizes, deliveries, and prices.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, certain of the Futures Contracts available on the ICE Futures are subject to accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	To the extent that USCF uses spreads and straddles as part of its trading strategy, there is the risk that the per unit NAV may not closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If USCF were to utilize a spread or straddle position and the spread performed differently than expected, the results could impact UGA s tracking error.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	This could affect UGA s investment objective of having its per unit NAV closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Additionally, a loss on a spread position would negatively impact UGA s absolute return.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	For a more detailed discussion regarding spreads and straddles, please see Item 1.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Business Spreads and Straddles in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	UGA and USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to maintain UGA s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with UGA s objective of having the value of its units per unit NAV track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	USCF has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of UGA, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with the best interests of investors.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Limited partners have limited voting control, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amendment of the LP Agreement, change in UGA s basic investment policy, dissolution of this fund, or the sale or distribution of UGA s assets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	USCF serves as the general partner to each of UGA, USOF, USNG, US12OF, USHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO and the sponsor for USCI and CPER, and will serve as the sponsor for USMI, USAG, USSF, UNGD, USGO and USABF if such funds offer their securities to the public or begin operations.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	USCF may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for UGA may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These trading decisions may be influenced since USCF also serves as the general partner or sponsor for all of the funds and is required to meet all of the funds investment objectives as well as UGA s.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If USCF believes that a trading decision it made on behalf of UGA might (i) impede its other funds from reaching their investment objectives, or (ii) improve the likelihood of meeting its other funds objectives, then USCF may choose to change its trading decision for UGA, which could either impede or improve the opportunity for UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of its other funds if the need for indemnification arises.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S4	This potential indemnification will cause USCF s assets to decrease.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P53_S5	If USCF s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification, then USCF may terminate and investors could lose their investment.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Unitholders may only vote on the removal of USCF and limited partners have only limited voting rights.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Unitholders and limited partners will not participate in the management of UGA and do not control USCF so they will not have influence over basic matters that affect UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Limited partners will have limited voting rights with respect to UGA s affairs.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Unitholders must apply to become limited partners, and unitholders that have not applied to become limited partners have no voting rights, other than to remove USCF as the general partner of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Even then, unitholders may remove USCF only if 66 2/3% of the unitholders elect to do so.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Unitholders and limited partners will not be permitted to participate in the management or control of UGA or the conduct of its business.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Unitholders and limited partners must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to manage UGA s affairs.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S5	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S6	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority in interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S7	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S8	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S9	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S10	USCF may manage a large amount of assets and this could affect UGA s ability to trade profitably.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S11	Increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S12	In general, USCF does not intend to limit the amount of assets of UGA that it may manage.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P55_S13	The more assets USCF manages, the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Under Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for UGA obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	A limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of UGA s capital securities representing units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	However, a limited partner may be required to repay to UGA any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Under Delaware law, UGA may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes UGA s liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of UGA s assets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S6	With adequate notice, a limited partner may be required to withdraw from the partnership for any reason.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S7	If USCF gives at least fifteen (15) days written notice to a limited partner, then USCF may for any reason, in its sole discretion, require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P56_S8	USCF may require withdrawal even in situations where the limited partner has complied completely with the provisions of the LP Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to re-invest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	An investor should not invest in UGA if it will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P57_S5	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.07% of average total net assets based on futures commission merchant fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration fees with the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of the units subsequent to the initial offering of the units including the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	UGA also pays the fees and expenses, including directors and officers liability insurance, of the independent directors, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, tax accounting and reporting costs, and over-the-counter spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If offerings of the units do not raise sufficient funds to pay UGA s future expenses and no other source of funding of expenses is found, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Prior to the offering of units that commenced on February 26, 2008, all of UGA s expenses were funded by USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S6	These payments by USCF and its affiliates were designed to allow UGA the ability to commence the public offering of its units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S7	UGA now directly pays certain of these fees and expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S8	USCF will continue to pay other fees and expenses, as set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S9	If USCF and UGA are unable to raise sufficient funds to cover their expenses or locate any other source of funding, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S10	UGA may incur higher fees and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S11	The clearing arrangements between the clearing brokers and UGA generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given UGA notice.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S12	Upon termination, USCF may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if UGA intends to continue trading in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at its present level of capacity.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P59_S13	The services of any clearing broker may not be available, or even if available, these services may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated clearing arrangements.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	UGA may miss certain trading opportunities because it will not receive the benefit of the expertise of independent trading advisors.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	USCF does not employ trading advisors for UGA; however, it reserves the right to employ them in the future.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The only advisor to UGA is USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	A lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to UGA because it will not receive the benefit of a trading advisor s expertise.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the NAV of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The financial markets are currently in a period of disruption and UGA does not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Since 2008, the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S2	The conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, the Administration and Congress have periodically been reaching impasses in passing a fiscal budget which could create long-term concerns regarding the credit of the United States and interest earned, as well as the United States Government s ability to pay its obligations to holders of Treasuries.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S4	If low interest rates on Treasuries continues or if UGA is not able to redeem its investments in Treasuries prior to maturity and the U.S. Government cannot pay its obligations, UGA would be negatively impacted.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, UGA might also be negatively impacted by its use of money market mutual funds to the extent those funds might themselves be using Treasuries.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late 2010, economic growth in 2011 has been slow and the financial markets are still fragile and could fall into another recession.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Another recession could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of UGA s service providers and Authorized Purchasers, which would impact the ability of USCF to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In that event, the clearing broker s customers, such as UGA, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with the clearing broker; though the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	UGA also may be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, to the extent UGA s clearing broker is required to post UGA s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all of the clearing broker s customers.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If UGA s clearing broker defaults to the clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by UGA and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	From time to time, the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A clearing broker s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear UGA s trades.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Third parties may utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and it has registered its trademarks.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, then any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The success of UGA depends on the ability of USCF to accurately implement trading systems, and any failure to do so could subject UGA to losses on such transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	USCF uses mathematical formulas built into a generally available spreadsheet program to decide whether it should buy or sell Gasoline Interests each day.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Specifically, USCF uses the spreadsheet to make mathematical calculations and to monitor positions in Gasoline Interests and Treasuries and correlations to the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	USCF must accurately process the spreadsheets outputs and execute the transactions called for by the formulas.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In addition, UGA relies on USCF to properly operate and maintain its computer and communications systems.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Extraordinary transaction volume, hardware or software failure, power or telecommunications failure, a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Any significant degradation or failure of the systems that USCF uses to gather and analyze information, enter orders, process data, monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions, liability to other parties, lost profit opportunities, damages to USCF s and UGA s reputations, increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Any failure, inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the formulas or systems, including implementing upgrades and compatibility with the computer systems of third parties, and executing UGA s transactions could impair its ability to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S7	It could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S8	This could cause substantial losses on transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S9	The occurrence of a terrorist attack, or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities could disrupt UGA s trading activity and materially affect UGA s profitability.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S10	The operations of UGA, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which UGA does business, and the markets in which UGA does business could be severely disrupted in the event of a major terrorist attack or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P71_S11	Global anti-terrorism initiatives, political unrest in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, as well as political hostility towards the United States, continue to fuel this concern.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Risk of Leverage and Volatility If USCF permits UGA to become leveraged, investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment if UGA s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interests ) entire market value.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	This feature permits commodity pools to leverage their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts (or other commodity interests) with an aggregate value in excess of the commodity pool s assets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	While this leverage can increase the pool s profits, relatively small adverse movements in the price of the pool s futures contracts can cause significant losses to the pool.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P73_S3	While USCF has not and does not currently intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement or otherwise.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The price of gasoline is volatile which could cause large fluctuations in the price of units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Movements in the price of gasoline may be the result of factors outside of USCF s control and may not be anticipated by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Among the factors that can cause volatility in the price of gasoline are:
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	the impact of environmental and other governmental regulations Over-the-Counter Contract Risk Currently, over-the-counter transactions are subject to little regulation.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade over-the-counter contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Currently, over-the-counter contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act had been essentially unregulated by the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	The markets for over-the-counter contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P76_S3	While the Dodd-Frank Act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over-the-counter market, the current regulation of the over-the-counter contracts could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the over-the-counter market will be subject to much more extensive CFTC oversight and regulation after the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over-the-counter contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S3	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S4	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S5	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S6	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S7	UGA may be subject to liquidity risk with respect to its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S8	Over-the-counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S9	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P77_S10	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over-the-counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In general, valuing over-the-counter derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such over-the-counter derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating over-the-counter contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding over-the-counter derivatives transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Risk of Trading in International Markets Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The CFTC, NFA and the domestic exchanges have little, if any, regulatory authority over the activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, and have little, if any, power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non-U.S. laws.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Similarly, the rights of market participants, such as UGA, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non-U.S. market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of U.S. markets or brokers.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	As a result, in these markets, UGA has less legal and regulatory protection than it does when it trades domestically.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In some of these non-U.S. markets, the performance on a contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes UGA to credit risk.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves UGA susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S6	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S7	UGA s international trading could expose it to losses resulting from non-U.S. exchanges that are less developed or less reliable than United States exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S8	Some non-U.S. exchanges may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P82_S9	In addition, UGA may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders, and the historical market data on which USCF bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for U.S. exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P83_S2	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P83_S4	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its units may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its units for a taxable year.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P84_S2	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to units could be reallocated if the IRS does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects unitholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S4	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S5	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S6	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S7	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S8	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to unitholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S9	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to units, any distributions would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income.
1396878_12_ITEM1A_P86_S10	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in units and could substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is not currently a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Introduction UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per unit NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The regulation of commodity interests in the United States is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	On July 21, 2010, a broad financial regulatory reform bill, the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	All of the Dodd-Frank Act s provisions became effective on July 16, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	However, some new rules implementing, and in many cases, interpreting and clarifying, the Dodd-Frank Act s new requirements have not been completely finalized and have been challenged in court.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some specific examples of how the new Dodd-Frank Act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact USGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. Price Movements Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2011 and exhibited a general uptrend through April, 2011 followed by a general downward trend until December 2011 that was punctuated by several spikes upward.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $2.4303 per gallon.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	Prices rose sharply over the course of the year and hit a peak on April 29, 2011 of $3.3984 per gallon.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S8	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.6574 per gallon, up approximately 9.34% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S9	UGA s per unit NAV rose during the year from a starting level of $42.06 to a high of $55.71 on April 29, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S10	UGA s per unit NAV reached its low for the year on January 25, 2011 at $40.76.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P3_S11	UGA s per unit NAV on December 31, 2011 was $48.37, up approximately 15.00% over the year.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2011 contract and ended with the February 2012 contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The return of approximately 9.34% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its units on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per unit and issued 300,000 units to the initial Authorized Purchaser, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, units that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	The decrease in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the non-inccurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009, these fees and expenses amounted to a total of $433,046 for UGA and the Related Public Funds, except USCI, USAG, CPER and USMI, and UGA s portion of such fees and expenses was $3,734.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	The increase in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of directors and officers liability insurance coverage and the incurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Effective as of March 3, 2009, USCF obtained directors and officers liability insurance covering all of the directors and officers of USCF.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	The increase in the total commissions paid to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily a function of increased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	The increase in activity required UGA to trade a greater number of futures contracts and incur a higher amount of commissions.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	The decrease in the total commissions paid to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily a function of decreased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	The decrease in activity required UGA to trade a lesser number of futures contracts and incur a lower amount of commissions.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	As an annualized percentage of average total net assets, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2011 represents approximately 0.07% of average total net assets.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	These costs are estimated to be $250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	USCF, though under no obligation to do so, agreed to pay certain expenses, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2012.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA earned $19,169 in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S10	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during these time periods.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S11	Interest rates on short-term investments, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were lower during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P20_S12	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average total net assets was lower during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

1396878_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	For the three months ended December 31, 2011, UGA earned $3,851 in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.02%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	UGA purchased Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2011 and held cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	By comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, UGA earned $7,637 and $9,118, respectively, in dividend and interest income on such cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S9	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 0.05%, and 0.05% respectively.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S10	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2010 or 2009 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during these time periods.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S11	Interest rates on short-term investments, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were lower during the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P25_S12	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average total net assets was lower during the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per unit NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the changes in the average daily price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per unit NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per unit NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per unit NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2011, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.040%, while the simple average daily change in the per unit NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.037%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S6	The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S7	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per unit NAV was (1.140)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S8	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per unit NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S9	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract since inception.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S10	Since the commencement of the offering of UGA units to the public on February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2011, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.034%, while the simple average daily change in the per unit NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.032%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S11	The average daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P26_S12	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per unit NAV was (0.566)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its NAV, versus the expected changes in its NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 15.00%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	This is based on an initial per unit NAV of $42.06 on December 31, 2010 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2011 of $48.37.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $48.76 as of December 31, 2011, for a total return over the relevant time period of 15.93%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 15.00% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 15.93% was an error over the time period of (0.93)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA received dividend and interest income of $19,169, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 0.02% for such period.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA also collected $26,200 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA incurred net expenses of $943,859.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(898,490), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of (0.80)% for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2010, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 15.52%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	This was based on an initial per unit NAV of $36.41 on December 31, 2009 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2010 of $42.06.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $42.42 as of December 31, 2010, for a total return over the relevant time period of 16.51%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 15.52% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 16.51% was an error over the time period of 0.99%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA received dividend and interest income of $31,732, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 0.04% for such period.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA also collected $16,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA incurred net expenses of $651,200.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(603,468), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of (0.84)% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 80.16%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	This was based on an initial per unit NAV of $20.21 on December 31, 2008 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2009 of $36.41.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S7	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S8	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $36.74 as of December 31, 2009, for a total return over the relevant time period of 81.79%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S9	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 80.16% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 81.79% was an error over the time period of (1.63)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P30_S10	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA received dividend and interest income of $94,681, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of 0.15% for such period.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA also collected $29,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2009, UGA incurred net expenses of $565,906.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(442,225), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of (0.70)% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per unit NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Second, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its unitholders and did not make any distributions to unitholders during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per unit NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA earned, on an annualized basis, approximately 0.02% on its cash holdings.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	It also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of 0.60% for management fees and approximately 0.07% in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts, and 0.17% for other expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per unit NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per unit NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2.00 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.00.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	Using the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S7	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S8	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 8%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P42_S9	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Using again the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	In this example, it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P43_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years (2002-2011).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between 2002 and 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Investors will further note that the markets display a very seasonal pattern that corresponds to the seasonal demand patterns for gasoline mentioned above.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	That is, in many, but not all cases, the price of the near month is higher than the next month during the middle of the summer months as the price of gasoline for delivery in those summer months rises to meet peak demand.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	At the same time, the price of the near month contract, when that month is just before the onset of spring, does not rise as far or as fast as the price of a next month contract whose delivery falls closer to the start of the summer season.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its units match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA units during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	For example, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2010 and held to December 31, 2011 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by 15.00%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 9.34% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2009 and held to December 31, 2010 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by 15.52%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 18.38% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per unit NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the percentage changes in price of both UGA s units and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was impacted by several factors.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2011 at $2.4303 per gallon.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	It rose over the course of the year and hit a peak on April 29, 2011 of $3.3984 per gallon.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.6574 per gallon, up approximately 9.34% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	On the consumption side, demand increased inside and outside the United States as global economic growth, including emerging economies such as China and India, continued to improve during 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	On the supply side, efforts to reduce production by OPEC to more closely match global consumption were partially successful.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	In the summer of 2011, production was also disrupted by political unrest in the Middle East, particularly Libya, which reduced global supply by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	On June 23, 2011, the United States and other industrial nations announced the release of 60 million barrels of crude oil from strategic stockpiles in an effort to reduce the price of fuel.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	This announcement briefly lowered the price of crude oil, but the release of oil from strategic stockpiles did not in and of itself have an impact on the price of crude oil as of December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	Crude oil prices finished 2011 approximately 8.15% higher than at the beginning of the year, as the global economy continues to adjust to periods of slow recovery and economic growth.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	USCF believes that should the global economic situation cease to improve, or decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	For the ten year time period between 2002 and 2011, the chart below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of unleaded gasoline on a monthly basis was not strongly correlated, positively or negatively, with the movements of large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds or global equities.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	However, movements in unleaded gasoline had a strong positive correlation to movements in crude oil and heating oil.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Finally, unleaded gasoline had a positive, but weak, correlation with natural gas.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The chart below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above chart.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2011, unleaded gasoline continued to have a strong positive correlation with crude oil and heating oil.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	During this period, it also had positive, yet weak correlation with the movements of natural gas.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The correlation between unleaded gasoline and both large cap U.S. equities and global equities, which had been essentially non-correlated over the prior ten - year period ended December 31, 2011, had a positive correlation over the one-year period ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Finally, the results showed that unleaded gasoline and U.S. government bonds, which had essentially been non-correlated for the prior ten year period, were negatively correlated over this more recent time period.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per unit NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P60_S5	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming units, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its over-the-counter contracts and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	The balance of the net assets is held in UGA s account at the Custodian and in Treasuries at the futures commission merchant.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S5	Income received from UGA s money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, UGA was forced to use other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a drop in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P62_S8	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P63_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA was not forced to purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	Since the initial offering of units, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of units.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Market Risk Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S7	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P65_S8	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Credit Risk When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	UBS Securities, UGA s commodity broker, or any other broker that may be retained by UGA in the future, when acting as UGA s futures commission merchant in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	These futures commission merchants are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases over-the-counter contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2011, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $72,599,046.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	This amount may be subject to loss should the Custodian cease operations.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Off Balance Sheet Financing As of December 31, 2011, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem units, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 units as of February 29, 2012 called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	(Prior to February 29, 2012, the size of the Redemption Basket was 100,000 units).
1396878_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of units being redeemed.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Contractual Obligations UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily net assets.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its units with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	However, since UGA s initial offering of units, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional units of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of the Custodian and Transfer Agent, BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than USBO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	USCF, though under no obligation to do so, agreed to pay certain expenses normally borne by UGA to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2012.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to a futures commission merchant), over-the-counter dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Commission payments to a futures commission merchant are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2011, UGA s portfolio consisted of 693 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	the future, UGA may purchase over-the-counter contracts ( OTC Contracts ).
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC Contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC Contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC Contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC Contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA did not employ any hedging methods such as those described above since all of its investments were made over an exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Therefore, during such period, UGA was not exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	OTC Contracts may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P1_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P2_S4	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership units ( units ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).

1396878_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).

1396878_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Calculation of Net Asset Value Per Unit UGA s per unit NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing the amount by the total number of units issued and outstanding.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Net Income (Loss) Per Unit Net income (loss) per unit is the difference between the per unit NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	The weighted average units are equal to the number of units outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for units added and redeemed based on the amount of time the units were outstanding during such period.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	There were no units held by USCF at December 31, 2011.

1396878_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	During the years ended December 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, UGA incurred $26,907, $17,153 and $14,846, respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Investor Tax Reporting Cost The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	These costs were approximately $250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	USCF, though under no obligation to do so, agreed to pay certain expenses, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2012.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	NOTE 4 - CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	The above fee does not include the following expenses, which are also borne by USCF: the cost of placing advertisements in various periodicals; web construction and development; or the printing and production of various marketing materials.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S5	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S6	an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S7	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P41_S8	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	UGA has entered into a brokerage agreement with UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ).
1396878_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The agreement requires UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	In accordance with the agreement, UBS Securities charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than USBO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	NOTE 5 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires a futures commission merchant to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the futures commission merchant s proprietary activities.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA were exchange-traded through December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with a futures commission merchant are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the futures commission merchant s segregation requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	In the event of a futures commission merchant s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	The insolvency of a futures commission merchant could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that futures commission merchant; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of a futures commission merchant.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P53_S4	Also, the failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per unit NAV.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in such money market funds.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, UGA held investments in money market funds in the amounts of $37,481,350 and $53,466,934, respectively.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	USCF holds cash deposits with its custodian.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	Pursuant to a written agreement with BBH Co., uninvested overnight cash balances are swept to offshore branches of U.S. regulated and domiciled banks located in Toronto, Canada, London, United Kingdom, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and Nassau, Bahamas, which are subject to U.S. regulation and regulatory oversight.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries in the amounts of $35,117,696 and $10,458,588, respectively.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	This amount may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian cease operations.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statement of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	The following table presents per unit performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	An individual unitholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	NOTE 8 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S4	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S5	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P63_S6	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2011 using the fair value hierarchy: During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no significant transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2010 using the fair value hierarchy: During the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no significant transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-11 require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	The guidance requires retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	USCF is currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2011-11 will have on UGA s financial statements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	In May 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosure about fair value measurements in converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	The amendments are to be applied prospectively.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	For public entities, the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S4	For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S5	Early application by public entities is not permitted.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P70_S6	Nonpublic entities may apply the amendments early, but no earlier than for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The implementation of ASU No. 2011-04 is not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial statements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Effective as of February 29, 2012, the size of the Creation Basket and Redemption Basket was reduced from 100,000 units to 50,000 units.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures UGA maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in UGA s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of UGA if UGA had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UGA s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UGA have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting UGA is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	UGA s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to USCF and the Board of USCF regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1396878_12_ITEM8_P74_S5	There were no changes in UGA s internal control over financial reporting during UGA s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UGA s internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P0_S0	8-K pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and posted each month on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.

1396878_12_ITEM9B_P36_S0	Audit Committee The Board of USCF has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes III).
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P36_S1	The audit committee is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.

Other Committees Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of UGA are not compensated by UGA, but instead by USCF, UGA does not have a compensation committee.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P37_S2	Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P38_S0	USCF believes that it is necessary for each member of the Board to possess many qualities and skills.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P38_S1	USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P38_S2	There have not been any vacancies on USCF s Board since the commencement of operations of UGA in April 2007; however, if such a vacancy were to occur, the members of the Board would consider a candidate s management experience as well as his/her background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity and ethics.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P38_S3	In connection with this, the Board would also consider issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and skills.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P39_S0	The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board believes that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P40_S0	Corporate Governance Policy The Board of USCF has adopted a Corporate Governance Policy that applies to UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P40_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Corporate Governance Policy on its website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.

1396878_12_ITEM9B_P42_S0	In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy of USCF, the non-management directors of the Board (who are the same as the independent directors of the Board) meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions, without the presence of Management Directors or executive officers of USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P42_S1	The non-management directors have designated Malcolm R. Fobes III to preside over each such executive session.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P42_S2	Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Fobes by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S0	Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight The Board of USCF is led by a Chairman, Nicholas Gerber, who is also the President and CEO of USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S1	The Board s responsibilities include: (i) the selection, evaluation, retention and succession of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the selection and performance of other executive officers, (ii) understanding, reviewing and monitoring the implementation of strategic plans, annual operating plans and budgets, (iii) the selection and oversight of UGA s independent auditors and the oversight of UGA s financial statements, (iv) advising management on significant issues, (v) the review and approval of significant company actions and certain other matters, (vi) nominating directors and committee members and overseeing effective corporate governance and (vii) the consideration of other constituencies, such as USCF s and UGA s customers, employees, suppliers and the communities impacted by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S2	The non-management directors have designated Malcolm R. Fobes III as the presiding independent director.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S3	Mr. Fobes role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S4	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF, including investing in the futures contracts and other commodity interests in order to track the benchmark futures contracts of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P43_S5	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading the discussion and execution of new strategic objectives.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S0	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S1	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S2	The Board believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer facilitates information flow between USCF and the Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S3	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S4	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S5	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as over-the-counter swap contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S6	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S7	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P44_S8	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P45_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P46_S0	The Board also determines compensation payable to employees of USCF, including the portfolio managers of each of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P46_S1	The compensation of certain employees of USCF is, in part, based on the amount of assets under management by UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P46_S2	The Board feels that compensating certain employees, in part, based on the amount of assets under management is appropriate since having more assets in a fund generally reflects that investors perceive the fund s investment objective is being met.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in over-the-counter swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including over-the-counter swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any over-the-counter swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_12_ITEM9B_P47_S5	In making compensation decisions, the Board considers whether a compensation arrangement would expose UGA or the Related Public Funds to additional risks and whether the risks posed by such arrangement are consistent with the best interests of UGA s investors.

1396878_12_ITEM15_P1_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P1_S2	USCF does not intend to operate UGA in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.

1396878_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of four management directors (the Management Directors ), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	The Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant to its LLC Agreement, as amended from time to time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P7_S2	Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P7_S3	The Board has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis and Malcolm R. Fobes III).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P7_S4	For additional information relating to the audit committee, please see Item 10 .
1396878_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	An investment in the units provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	An investment in the units allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded ( over-the-counter ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P9_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	USCF does not intend to operate UGA in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P10_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P11_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s units for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P12_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P12_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the changes in the price of UGA s units will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, and that changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract will not closely correlate with changes in the spot prices of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P13_S2	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	Effective February 29, 2012, the units issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Purchasers and only in blocks of 50,000 units called Creation Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the units in the Creation Basket.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Purchasers may redeem units and only in blocks of 50,000 units called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P16_S3	Prior to February 29, 2012, Authorized Purchasers could only purchase or redeem units or blocks of 100,000 units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of units in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P17_S2	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per unit NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per unit NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per unit NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P17_S3	While UGA issues units only in Creation Baskets, units are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell units at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P18_S2	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per unit NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the units traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per unit NAV of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of the underlying gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s units traded on the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P19_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P19_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus 10 percent of B , where:
1396878_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s unit price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UGA s per unit NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract, will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s units on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P22_S2	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K. The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and swaps, including swaps in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P23_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) on UGA s ability to invest in over-the-counter transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as over-the-counter contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	In 2005, the NYMEX introduced new physical specifications for unleaded gasoline contracts to reflect the changes in the national standards for such fuels.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	Unleaded gasoline using MTBE was being phased out and replaced with unleaded gasoline using ethanol.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P30_S3	As a result, NYMEX introduced a new gasoline futures contract in 2005.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P30_S4	The new futures contract trades under the ticker symbol RB .
1396878_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The pre-existing unleaded gasoline futures contract, ticker symbol HU , ceased trading on December 29th, 2006.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	For a period of approximately 15 months both contracts were traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflict in Iraq represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P35_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a Heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	The Heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for Heating Oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	In addition, most U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S. based futures exchanges but does not limit the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S5	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S6	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for gasoline, the NYMEX will monitor such exposure and ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S7	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX, it could also order UGA and the Related Public Funds to reduce their aggregate net position back to the accountability level.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P43_S8	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2011, UGA held a net of 693 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts and the Related Public Funds held 239 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures XB contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	As of December 31, 2011, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P44_S3	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading n the near month contract to expire.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P44_S4	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	On October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted new rules, which establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures including Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts, executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets (i.e., certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	See Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA units, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P47_S4	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the futures commission merchant and would separately hold, through its Custodian or futures commission merchant, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P49_S4	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the futures commission merchant for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or futures commission merchant.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	Liquidity UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S5	Spot Commodities While the gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S6	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P50_S7	Leverage USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Borrowings Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as over-the-counter contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P54_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	UGA has not employed any hedging methods since all of its investments have been made over an exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Therefore, UGA has not been exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Pyramiding UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

1396878_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	Calculating Per Unit NAV UGA s per unit NAV is calculated by:
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The Administrator calculates the per unit NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	The per unit NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S3	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S4	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S5	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S6	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S7	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S8	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S9	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per unit NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S10	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P100_S11	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	The indicative fund value unit basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per unit NAV, because the per unit NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per unit basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S2	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S3	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S4	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S5	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s units are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P101_S6	As a result, during those gaps there will be no update to the indicative fund value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA units on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	If the market price of UGA units diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA units on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S5	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA are valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P103_S6	These investments are not included in the indicative value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	The indicative fund value is based on the prior day s per unit NAV and moves up and down solely according to changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Creation and Redemption of Units UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P105_S2	Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P105_S3	Authorized Purchasers must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or unitholder or Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	As of December 31, 2011, 13 Authorized Purchasers had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA issued 19 Creation Baskets and redeemed 19 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	In some cases, Authorized Purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Purchaser s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Each Authorized Purchaser is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, USCF has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K. Creation Procedures On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S3	Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a creation request.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S4	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S5	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P114_S6	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s purchase of units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	Determination of Required Deposits The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of units to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P116_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	Delivery of Required Deposits An Authorized Purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Purchaser s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S3	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S4	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P117_S5	UGA s per unit NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	Rejection of Purchase Orders USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual unitholder to redeem any units in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S5	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S6	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S7	An Authorized Purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S8	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S9	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P120_S10	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s sale of units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Determination of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of units to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Delivery of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P123_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P123_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P123_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P124_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P124_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P124_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P125_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Purchaser Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P125_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of units being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding units to 100,000 units ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P126_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P126_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Tax Responsibility Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	Secondary Market Transactions As noted, UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public units of any baskets it does create.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	Authorized Purchasers that do offer to the public units from the baskets they create will do so at per-unit offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Purchaser purchased the Creation Baskets and the per unit NAV of the units at the time of the offer of the units to the public, the supply of and demand for units at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S4	The prices of units offered by Authorized Purchasers are expected to fall between UGA s per unit NAV and the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P129_S5	Units initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Purchaser on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	Units trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S3	Units may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per unit NAV.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S4	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per unit NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell units in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S5	While the units trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P130_S6	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the units may widen.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Investments USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (retail, eligible contract participant, or eligible commercial entity), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The offer and sale of units of UGA, as well as units of each of the Related Public Funds is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of units are regulated as described above, as well as by the self regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S3	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S4	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P142_S5	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the over-the-counter markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S7	To date, the forward markets have been largely unregulated, forward contracts have been executed bilaterally and, in general, forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P144_S8	While recently adopted laws and regulations may require certain forward contracts to be cleared through regulated clearing organizations, absent such clearing organizations, UGA s trading in forward contracts will be exposed to the creditworthiness of the counterparties on the other side of the trade.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	Options on Futures Contracts Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S4	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S5	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S6	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S7	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P150_S8	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	Options on Forward Contracts or Commodities Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Swap Contracts Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P156_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P156_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	Regulation Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P158_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P158_S3	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P159_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	The CEA also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants unitholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	Unitholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P161_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	The CEA requires all futures commission merchants ( FCMs ), such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P163_S2	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P163_S3	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by futures commission merchants and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P163_S4	The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P164_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	On July 21, 2010, a broad financial regulatory reform bill, the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	All of the Dodd-Frank Act s provisions became effective on July 16, 2011, but the actual implementation of some of the provisions is subject to continuing uncertainty because implementing rules and regulations have not been completely finalized and have been challenged in court.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some specific examples of how the new Dodd-Frank Act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact UGA are discussed below.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	Futures Contracts and Position Limits Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy-based and other commodity futures contracts, certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over-the-counter commodity contracts; new registration, recordkeeping, capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	The new law and the rules thereunder may negatively impact UGA s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	Further, increased regulation of, and the imposition of additional costs on, swap transactions under the new legislation and implementing regulations could cause a reduction in the swap market and the overall derivatives markets, which could restrict liquidity and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P167_S3	In particular, new position limits imposed on UGA or its counterparties may impact UGA s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective, and new requirements, including capital and mandatory clearing, may increase the cost of UGA s investments and doing business, which could adversely impact the ability of UGA to achieve its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	On October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted regulations implementing position limits and limit formulas for 28 core physical commodity futures contracts, including the Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ( i.e. , certain regulated exchanges) and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	The new regulations require, among other things, aggregation of position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	However, the regulations do not appear to require aggregation of Referenced Contracts held by separate Related Public Funds.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S3	Although the regulations are effective on January 17, 2012, the position limit rules will be implemented in two phases: spot-month position limits and non-spot-month position limits.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S4	Spot-month limits will be effective sixty days after the term swap is defined under the Dodd-Frank Act (see below).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S5	The limits adopted will be based on the spot-month position limit levels currently in place at applicable futures exchanges (or designated contract market or DCM ).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S6	Thereafter, the spot-month limits will be adjusted annually for energy contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S7	These subsequent limits will be based on the CFTC s determination of deliverable supply in consultation with the futures exchanges.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S8	Spot-month position limit levels will be set generally at 25% of estimated deliverable supply, and limits will be applied separately for physical-delivery and cash-settled contracts in the same commodity.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S9	Non-spot-month position limits will go into effect by CFTC order after the CFTC has received one year of open interest data on physical commodity cleared and uncleared swaps under the swaps large trader reporting rule.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S10	The non-spot month limits will be adjusted biennially based on Referenced Contract open interest.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S11	Non-spot-month position limits ( i.e. , limits applied to positions in all contract months combined or in a single contract month) will be set using the 10/2.5 percent formula: 10 percent of the contract s first 25,000 of open interest and 2.5 percent thereafter.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P168_S12	These limits will be reset biennially based on two years of open interest data.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	On December 2, 2011, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) filed a lawsuit challenging the CFTC s position limits rule.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	The lawsuit asserts that the position limits rule inadequately fulfills the required cost-benefit analysis.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P169_S2	It is not known at this time what effect this lawsuit will have on the implementation of the new position limits rule.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of UGA to achieve its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	However, as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, additional studies are required to be conducted before all requirements of the final rules are implemented, and therefore, it cannot be determined with certainty what impact such regulations will have on UGA.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Dodd-Frank Acts imposes new regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that UGA is authorized to engage in, that may ultimately impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	On April 27, 2011, the CFTC and the SEC proposed joint rules defining the term swap and thus providing more clarity regarding which transactions will be regulated as such under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P171_S2	However, the CFTC and SEC have not implemented final regulations on this issue and it is therefore still uncertain which types of transactions will be ultimately regulated as swaps.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The proposed rule defining swap and security-based swap has not been finalized as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (which are referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as derivative clearing organizations ).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P173_S1	However, as described above, it is currently unknown which swaps will be subject to such trading and clearing requirements.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P174_S1	Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P174_S2	On July 25, 2011, the CFTC adopted final regulations to determine which entities will be regulated as swap dealers and major swap participants and thus have to comply with these capital and margin requirements (as well as a multitude of other requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act).
1396878_12_ITEM15_P174_S3	In general, increased regulation of, and the imposition of additional costs on, swap transactions could have an adverse effect on UGA by, for example, reducing the size of and therefore liquidity in the derivatives market, increasing transaction costs and decreasing the ability to customize derivative transactions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P174_S4	The final rule regarding review of swaps for mandatory clearing went effective September 26, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	On July 14, 2011, the CFTC issued an order providing temporary relief from certain swaps-related provisions of Title VII that would have automatically taken effect on July 16, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	The final order granted temporary exemptive relief that, by its terms, expires upon the earlier of the effective date of the required final rulemaking or December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	On October 18, 2011, the CFTC issued an order, which modifies the July 14, 2011 order by extending the temporary exemptive relief to the earlier of the effective date of the required final rulemaking or July 16, 2012.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	On January 11, 2012, the CFTC adopted a rule requiring FCMs and derivative clearing organizations to segregate customer collateral supporting cleared swaps.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P176_S1	This rule is scheduled to be effective November 8, 2012.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P176_S2	UGA does not anticipate any impact to its operations in order to meet the requirements of the new rule.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Commodity Margin Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P177_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P178_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S4	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S5	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S6	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S7	Trading in the over-the-counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally does not require margin but generally does require the extension of credit between counterparties.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S8	This extension of credit is generally secured by transfers of collateral and/or independent amounts.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P179_S9	Collateral is transferred between counterparties during the term of an over-the-counter transaction based upon the changing value of the transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the start of an over-the-counter transaction.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P180_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P182_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P182_S2	If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P182_S3	With respect to UGA s trading, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	SEC Reports UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P184_S2	CFTC Reports UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.

1396878_12_ITEM15_P185_S2	No. 3638984) for investment services in the field of gasoline futures contracts and other gasoline related investments, in use since February 26, 2008.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P185_S3	UGA relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P185_S4	So long as UGA continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations, it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	USCF has been granted two patents, Nos. 7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund ( ETF ) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Price Range of Units UGA s units have traded on the NYSE Arca under the symbol UGA since November 25, 2008.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to trading on the NYSE Arca, UGA s units traded on the AMEX under the symbol UGA since its initial public offering on February 26, 2008.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth the range of reported high and low sales prices of the units as reported on the AMEX and NYSE Arca, as applicable, for the periods indicated below.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2011, UGA had approximately 26,024 holders of units.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Dividends UGA has not made and does not currently intend to make cash distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities UGA does not purchase units directly from its unitholders; however, in connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Purchasers, UGA redeemed 19 baskets (comprising 1,900,000 units) during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P0_S0	addition, UGA is not aware of any 5% holder of its units.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P1_S0	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P2_S0	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P2_S1	However, there have been no direct financial transactions between UGA and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P3_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P4_S0	Any transaction with a related person that must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K item 404(a), including financial transactions by UGA with directors or executive officers of USCF or holders of beneficial interests in USCF or UGA of more than 5%, will be subject to the provisions regarding Resolutions of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care as set forth in Section 7.7 of the LP Agreement and will be reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the Board of USCF.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P5_S0	In February 2012, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_12_ITEM12_P5_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Indirectly in Gasoline Investing in Gasoline Interests subjects UGA to the risks of the gasoline industry and this could result in large fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA is subject to the risks and hazards of the gasoline industry because it invests in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The risks and hazards that are inherent in the gasoline industry may cause the price of gasoline to widely fluctuate.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If the changes in percentage terms of UGA s units accurately track the changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price of gasoline, then the price of its units may also fluctuate.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The exploration for crude oil, the raw material used in the production of gasoline, and production of gasoline are uncertain processes with many risks.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells for crude oil is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production of gasoline, including:
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing activities involve numerous risks that may affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There are a variety of hazards inherent in gasoline transmission, distribution, gathering, and processing, such as leaks, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes and flooding), pipeline failure, abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, and other hazards which could affect the price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	To the extent these hazards limit the supply or delivery of gasoline, gasoline prices will increase.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The price of gasoline fluctuates on a seasonal basis and this would result in fluctuations in the price of UGA s units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	For example, during the winter months the heating season can have a major impact on prices in the fuel industry.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	During the summer months, people are more likely to travel by automobile when taking spring and summer vacations along with weekend trips.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The increase in travel drives fuel demand and gasoline prices typically follow.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Refineries usually use the spring months for major routine maintenance and to retool for summer gasoline blends required in various parts of the country to meet air emission requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Refinery maintenance as well as unplanned shut-downs reduce gasoline production.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Depending on inventory levels and the strength of gasoline demand, this situation may put pressure on prices until additional gasoline supplies can be imported.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Supply interruptions may also affect inventories.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	For example, the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 had a major impact on energy-producing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, where roughly one-third of oil production in the United States occurs.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, the effects remain as repairs are continuing at some production and pipeline facilities that were severely damaged.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Changes in the political climate could have negative consequences for gasoline prices.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Uprisings in the Middle East, including civil war in Syria and uprisings in Egypt, could put oil exports in jeopardy.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As global markets continue to react to various crises and uprisings, such unrest in general could impact the production, supply and cost of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Limitations on ability to develop additional sources of oil could impact future prices of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the past, a supply disruption in one area of the world was softened by the ability of major oil-producing nations to increase output to make up the difference.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	At times, some of that spare reserve capacity has been absorbed by increased demand.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Gasoline refinement and production is subject to government regulations which could have an impact on the price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Gasoline refinement and production in North America are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various state regulatory agencies.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	For example, as a result of changes in fuel specifications, United States refiners in the spring and summer of 2006 began phasing out the fuel additive MTBE and replacing it with ethanol.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The switch to ethanol, which is mandated by federal law, has resulted in a tightened supply and higher prices for this grain-based product.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Although increased use of ethanol is expected to bring environmental benefits, ethanol adds to gasoline production costs because it currently is more expensive than the MTBE it is replacing.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Various formulations and compositions of gasoline as may be required by different state environmental laws and/or the U.S. Government may impact the price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Some areas of the country are required to use special formulations of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Environmental programs, aimed at reducing carbon monoxide, smog, and air toxics, include the Federal and/or state-required oxygenated, reformulated, and low-volatility (evaporates more slowly) gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Other environmental programs put restrictions on transportation and storage.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The reformulated gasoline required in some urban areas and in California cost more to produce than conventional gasoline served elsewhere, increasing the price paid at the pump.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Changing standards in the future may further impact the price of gasoline in this regard.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV may not correlate with daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If this were to occur, investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets as fully as possible in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit NAV closely correlate with the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	However, daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV may not correlate with the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for several reasons as set forth below:
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	UGA (i) may not be able to buy/sell the exact amount of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with the per unit NAV; (ii) may not always be able to buy and sell Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at the market price; and (iii) is required to pay fees, including brokerage fees and the management fee, which will have an effect on the correlation.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Short-term supply and demand for gasoline may cause the changes in the market price of the Benchmark Futures Contract to vary from the changes in UGA s per unit NAV if UGA has fully invested in Futures Contracts that do not reflect such supply and demand and it is unable to replace such contracts with Futures Contracts that do reflect such supply and demand.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	UGA sells and buys only as many Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that it can to get the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit NAV as close as possible to the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The remainder of its assets are invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents and are used to satisfy initial margin and additional margin requirements, if any, and to otherwise support its investments in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents, both directly and as margin, provide rates of return that vary from changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, because UGA incurs certain expenses in connection with its investment activities, and holds most of its assets in more liquid short-term securities for margin and other liquidity purposes and for redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis, USCF is generally not able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments and there cannot be perfect correlation between changes in UGA s per unit NAV and changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As UGA grows, there may be more or less correlation.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	For example, if UGA only has enough money to buy three Futures Contracts and it needs to buy four contracts to track the price of gasoline then the correlation will be lower, but if it buys 20,000 Futures Contracts and it needs to buy 20,001 contracts then the correlation will be higher.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	At certain asset levels, UGA may be limited in its ability to purchase the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments due to accountability levels imposed by the relevant exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	To the extent that UGA invests in these other Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract may be lower.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If UGA is required to invest in other Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are less correlated with the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would likely invest in over-the-counter contracts to increase the level of correlation of UGA s assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Over-the-counter contracts entail certain risks described below under Over-the-Counter Contract Risk.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	UGA may not be able to buy the exact number of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments to have a perfect correlation with the Benchmark Futures Contract if the purchase price of Futures Contracts required to be fully invested in such contracts is higher than the proceeds received for the sale of a Creation Basket on the day the basket was sold.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In such case, UGA could not invest the entire proceeds from the purchase of the Creation Basket in such futures contracts (for example, assume UGA receives $4,000,000 for the sale of a Creation Basket and assume that the price of a Futures Contract for gasoline is $59,950, then UGA could only invest in only 66 Futures Contracts with an aggregate value of $3,956,700), UGA would be required to invest a percentage of the proceeds in cash, Treasuries or other liquid securities to be deposited as margin with the FCM through which the contracts were purchased.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The remainder of the purchase price for the Creation Basket would remain invested in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents or other liquid securities as determined by USCF from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If the trading market for Futures Contracts is suspended or closed, UGA may not be able to purchase these investments at the last reported price.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV do not correlate with daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, then investing in UGA may not be an effective way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with the spot price of gasoline and this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If this were to occur, then investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, the price relationship between the near month contract and the next month contract that compose the Benchmark Futures Contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of UGA s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other gasoline price indices total returns.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	When using the Benchmark Futures Contract as a strategy to track the spot price of gasoline, at best the correlation between changes in prices of such Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline can be only approximate.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for such Gasoline Interests and technical influences in futures trading.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If there is a weak correlation between the Gasoline Interests and the spot price of gasoline, then, even in situations where there is also tracking among the prices of units, the per unit NAV and Gasoline Interests, the price of units may not accurately track the spot price of gasoline and investors may not be able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when the near month contract is sold and replaced with the next month contract to expire.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result, the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track higher.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Conversely, in the event of a gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	As a result the total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract would tend to track lower.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of UGA s per unit NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, this could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per unit NAV and total return.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	UGA may experience a loss if it is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The value of Treasuries generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If UGA is required to sell Treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired, UGA will experience a loss.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	This loss may adversely impact the price of the units and may decrease the correlation among the price of units, the per unit NAV of units, the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	UGA may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market in its currency, its gasoline production or exports, or in another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Alternatively, limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and daily price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Unexpected market illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, UGA has not and does not intend at this time to establish a credit facility, which would provide an additional source of liquidity and instead relies only on the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it holds.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The anticipated large value of the positions in Futures Contracts that USCF will acquire or enter into for UGA increases the risk of illiquidity.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Other Gasoline-Related Investments that UGA invests in, such as negotiated over-the-counter contracts, may have a greater likelihood of being illiquid since they are contracts between two parties that take into account not only market risk, but also the relative credit, tax, and settlement risks under such contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Such contracts also have limited transferability that results from such risks and from the contract s express limitations.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA s Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If the nature of hedgers and speculators in futures markets has shifted such that gasoline purchasers are the predominant hedgers in the market, UGA might have to reinvest at higher futures prices or choose Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The changing nature of the hedgers and speculators in the gasoline market influences whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	In order to induce speculators to take the corresponding long side of the same futures contract, gasoline producers must generally be willing to sell futures contracts at prices that are below expected future spot prices.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Conversely, if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the gasoline who purchase futures contracts to hedge against a rise in prices, then speculators will only take the short side of the futures contract if the futures price is greater than the expected future spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P29_S8	This can have significant implications for UGA when it is time to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing Futures Contract into a new Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	While UGA does not intend to take physical delivery of gasoline under its Futures Contracts, physical delivery under such contracts impacts the value of the contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While it is not the current intention of UGA to take physical delivery of gasoline under any of its Futures Contracts, futures contracts are not required to be cash-settled and it is possible to take delivery under some of these contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Storage costs associated with purchasing gasoline could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Storage costs include the time value of money invested in gasoline as a physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the gasoline less any benefits from ownership of gasoline that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In general, Futures Contracts have a one-month delay for contract delivery and the back month (the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month) includes storage costs.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	To the extent that these storage costs change for gasoline while UGA holds Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the value of the Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and therefore UGA s NAV, may change as well.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K. Investing in UGA for purposes of hedging may be subject to several risks including the possibility of losing the benefit of favorable market movement.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Participants in the gasoline or in other industries may use UGA as a vehicle to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There are several risks in connection with using UGA as a hedging device.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	While hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices, it can also preclude a hedger s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In a hedging transaction, the hedger may be concerned that the hedged item will increase in price, but must recognize the risk that the price may instead decline and if this happens he will have lost his opportunity to profit from the change in price because the hedging transaction will result in a loss rather than a gain.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Thus, the hedger foregoes the opportunity to profit from favorable price movements.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on gasoline prices and gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	There is no historic evidence that the spot price of gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	UGA s Operating Risks UGA is not a registered investment company so unitholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage trading activities.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. Howard Mah and John Hyland.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If Messrs. Mah or Hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Furthermore, Messrs. Mah and Hyland are currently involved in the management of the Related Public Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	USCF has also filed registration statements to register units of USSF, UNGD, USGO and UAC, each a series of the United States Commodity Funds Trust I, and HARD, a series of the United States Currency Funds Trust.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Mr. Mah is also employed by Ameristock Corporation, a registered investment adviser that until January 11, 2013 managed a public mutual fund.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	On January 11, 2013, Ameristock Mutual Fund, Inc. was reorganized with and into the Drexel Hamilton Centre American Equity Fund, a series of the Drexel Hamilton Mutual Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Drexel Hamilton Mutual Funds and its advisor, Drexel Hamilton Investment Partners, are not affiliated with Ameristock Corporation, the Ameristock Mutual Fund, Inc. or USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	After the consummation of the reorganization and liquidation, the Ameristock Corporation maintained its non-advisory assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	It is estimated that Mr. Mah will spend approximately 98% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Mr. Hyland will spend approximately 100% of his time on UGA and Related Public Fund matters.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P46_S5	To the extent that USCF establishes additional funds, even greater demands will be placed on Messrs. Mah and Hyland, as well as the other officers of USCF and its Board.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause a tracking error, which could cause the price of units to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract and prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In late 2011, the CFTC adopted the Position Limit Rules, which were scheduled to become effective on October 12, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, on September 28, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated these regulations on the basis of ambiguities in the provisions of the CEA (as modified by the Dodd-Frank Act) upon which the regulations were based.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In its September 28, 2012 decision, the court remanded the Position Limit Rules to the CFTC with instructions to use its expertise and experience to resolve the ambiguities in the statute.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	On November 15, 2012, the CFTC indicated that it will move forward with an appeal of the District Court s decision to vacate the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	At this time, it is not possible to predict how the CFTC s appeal could affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Furthermore, until such time as the appeal is resolved or, if applicable revisions to the Position Limit Rules are proposed and adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the enactment of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S7	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the vacated Position Limit Rules would have required the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S9	The CFTC is presently considering new aggregation rules, under a rulemaking proposal that is distinct from the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S10	At this time, it is unclear how any modified aggregation rules may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S11	By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with any potential revised Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S12	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P49_S13	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed gasoline futures.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	To the extent that USCF uses spreads and straddles as part of its trading strategy, there is the risk that the per unit NAV may not closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If USCF were to utilize a spread or straddle position and the spread performed differently than expected, the results could impact UGA s tracking error.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	This could affect UGA s investment objective of having its per unit NAV closely track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Additionally, a loss on a spread position would negatively impact UGA s absolute return.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	For a more detailed discussion regarding spreads and straddles, please see Item 1.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Business Spreads and Straddles in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	UGA and USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to maintain UGA s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with UGA s objective of having the value of its units per unit NAV track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S5	USCF has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of UGA, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with the best interests of investors.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Limited partners have limited voting control, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amendment of the LP Agreement, change in UGA s basic investment policy, dissolution of this fund, or the sale or distribution of UGA s assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	USCF serves as the general partner to each of UGA, USOF, USNG, US12OF, USDHO, USSO, US12NG and USBO and the sponsor for USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, and will serve as the sponsor for USSF, UNGD, USGO, UAC and HARD if such funds offer their securities to the public or begin operations.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	USCF may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for UGA may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These trading decisions may be influenced since USCF also serves as the general partner or sponsor for all of the funds and is required to meet all of the funds investment objectives as well as UGA s.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If USCF believes that a trading decision it made on behalf of UGA might (i) impede its other funds from reaching their investment objectives, or (ii) improve the likelihood of meeting its other funds objectives, then USCF may choose to change its trading decision for UGA, which could either impede or improve the opportunity for UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of its other funds if the need for indemnification arises.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	This potential indemnification will cause USCF s assets to decrease.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S5	If USCF s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification, then USCF may terminate and investors could lose their investment.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Unitholders may only vote on the removal of USCF and limited partners have only limited voting rights.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Unitholders and limited partners will not participate in the management of UGA and do not control USCF so they will not have influence over basic matters that affect UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P56_S8	In addition, UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Limited partners will have limited voting rights with respect to UGA s affairs.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Unitholders must apply to become limited partners, and unitholders that have not applied to become limited partners have no voting rights, other than to remove USCF as the general partner of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Even then, unitholders may remove USCF only if 66 2/3% of the unitholders elect to do so.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Unitholders and limited partners will not be permitted to participate in the management or control of UGA or the conduct of its business.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Unitholders and limited partners must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to manage UGA s affairs.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority in interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S5	USCF may manage a large amount of assets and this could affect UGA s ability to trade profitably.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S6	Increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S7	In general, USCF does not intend to limit the amount of assets of UGA that it may manage.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P58_S8	The more assets USCF manages, the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Under Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for UGA obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	A limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of UGA s capital securities representing units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	However, a limited partner may be required to repay to UGA any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Under Delaware law, UGA may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes UGA s liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of UGA s assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S6	With adequate notice, a limited partner may be required to withdraw from the partnership for any reason.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S7	If USCF gives at least fifteen (15) days written notice to a limited partner, then USCF may for any reason, in its sole discretion, require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P59_S8	USCF may require withdrawal even in situations where the limited partner has complied completely with the provisions of the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to re-invest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	An investor should not invest in UGA if it will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.07% of average total net assets based on FCM fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration fees with the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of the units subsequent to the initial offering of the units including the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	UGA also pays the fees and expenses, including directors and officers liability insurance, of the independent directors, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, tax accounting and reporting costs, and over-the-counter spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	If offerings of the units do not raise sufficient funds to pay UGA s future expenses and no other source of funding of expenses is found, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Prior to the offering of units that commenced on February 26, 2008, all of UGA s expenses were funded by USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S6	These payments by USCF and its affiliates were designed to allow UGA the ability to commence the public offering of its units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S7	UGA now directly pays certain of these fees and expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S8	USCF will continue to pay other fees and expenses, as set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S9	If USCF and UGA are unable to raise sufficient funds to cover their expenses or locate any other source of funding, UGA may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S10	UGA may incur higher fees and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S11	The clearing arrangements between the clearing brokers and UGA generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given UGA notice.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S12	Upon termination, USCF may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if UGA intends to continue trading in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments at its present level of capacity.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P62_S13	The services of any clearing broker may not be available, or even if available, these services may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated clearing arrangements.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	UGA may miss certain trading opportunities because it will not receive the benefit of the expertise of independent trading advisors.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	USCF does not employ trading advisors for UGA; however, it reserves the right to employ them in the future.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The only advisor to UGA is USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	A lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to UGA because it will not receive the benefit of a trading advisor s expertise.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the NAV of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The financial markets are currently in a slow period of recovery and the financial markets are still relatively fragile.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Since 2008, the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	In addition, the Administration and Congress have periodically been reaching impasses in passing a fiscal budget which could create long-term concerns regarding the credit of the United States and interest earned, as well as the United States Government s ability to pay its obligations to holders of Treasuries.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S4	If low interest rates on Treasuries continues or if UGA is not able to redeem its investments in Treasuries prior to maturity and the U.S. Government cannot pay its obligations, UGA would be negatively impacted.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P65_S5	In addition, UGA might also be negatively impacted by its use of money market mutual funds to the extent those funds might themselves be using Treasuries.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late 2010 and 2011, economic growth in 2012 was slow and the financial markets are still fragile.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A poor financial recovery could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of UGA s service providers and Authorized Purchasers, which would impact the ability of USCF to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In that event, the clearing broker s customers, such as UGA, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with the clearing broker; though the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	UGA also may be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition, to the extent UGA s clearing broker is required to post UGA s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all of the clearing broker s customers.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	If UGA s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by UGA and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	From time to time, the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	A clearing broker s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear UGA s trades.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In addition, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Third parties may utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, then any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The success of UGA depends on the ability of USCF to accurately implement trading systems, and any failure to do so could subject UGA to losses on such transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	USCF uses mathematical formulas built into a generally available spreadsheet program to decide whether it should buy or sell Gasoline Interests each day.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Specifically, USCF uses the spreadsheet to make mathematical calculations and to monitor positions in Gasoline Interests and Treasuries and correlations to the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	USCF must accurately process the spreadsheets outputs and execute the transactions called for by the formulas.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In addition, UGA relies on USCF to properly operate and maintain its computer and communications systems.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Extraordinary transaction volume, hardware or software failure, power or telecommunications failure, a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Any significant degradation or failure of the systems that USCF uses to gather and analyze information, enter orders, process data, monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions, liability to other parties, lost profit opportunities, damages to USCF s and UGA s reputations, increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S6	Any failure, inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the formulas or systems, including implementing upgrades and compatibility with the computer systems of third parties, and executing UGA s transactions could impair its ability to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S7	It could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S8	This could cause substantial losses on transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S9	The occurrence of a terrorist attack, or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities could disrupt UGA s trading activity and materially affect UGA s profitability.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S10	The operations of UGA, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which UGA does business, and the markets in which UGA does business could be severely disrupted in the event of a major terrorist attack or the outbreak, continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P74_S11	Global anti-terrorism initiatives, political unrest in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, as well as political hostility towards the United States, continue to fuel this concern.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Risk of Leverage and Volatility If USCF permits UGA to become leveraged, investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment if UGA s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interests ) entire market value.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	This feature permits commodity pools to leverage their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts (or other commodity interests) with an aggregate value in excess of the commodity pool s assets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	While this leverage can increase the pool s profits, relatively small adverse movements in the price of the pool s futures contracts can cause significant losses to the pool.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	While USCF has not and does not currently intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement or otherwise.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The price of gasoline is volatile which could cause large fluctuations in the price of units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Movements in the price of gasoline may be the result of factors outside of USCF s control and may not be anticipated by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Among the factors that can cause volatility in the price of gasoline are:
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	the impact of environmental and other governmental regulations Over-the-Counter Contract Risk Currently, over-the-counter transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade over-the-counter contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Currently, over-the-counter contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act had been essentially unregulated by the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	The markets for over-the-counter contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P79_S3	To date, the forward markets have been largely unregulated, forward contracts have been executed bi-laterally and, in general, forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The final determination does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, certain currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	While the Dodd-Frank Act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over-the-counter market, the current regulation of the over-the-counter contracts could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCOs.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	This is the CFTC s first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the over-the-counter market will be subject to much more extensive CFTC oversight and regulation after the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over-the-counter contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S3	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S4	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S5	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S6	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S7	UGA may be subject to liquidity risk with respect to its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S8	Over-the-counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S9	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P84_S10	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over-the-counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In general, valuing over-the-counter derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such over-the-counter derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating over-the-counter contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding over-the-counter derivatives transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and SEC to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization (i.e., uncleared swaps).
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	At this time, the CFTC has proposed a rule addressing this statutory right of certain market participants but has not yet implemented any final rules.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Risk of Trading in International Markets Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The CFTC, NFA and the domestic exchanges have little, if any, regulatory authority over the activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, and have little, if any, power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non-U.S. laws.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Similarly, the rights of market participants, such as UGA, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non-U.S. market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of U.S. markets or brokers.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S2	As a result, in these markets, UGA has less legal and regulatory protection than it does when it trades domestically.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S3	In some of these non-U.S. markets, the performance on a contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes UGA to credit risk.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves UGA susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P91_S6	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	International trading activities subject UGA to foreign exchange risk.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	The price of any non-U.S. commodity interest and, therefore, the potential profit and loss on such investment, may be affected by any variance in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the time it is liquidated, offset or exercised.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S2	As a result, changes in the value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar may cause losses to UGA even if the contract traded is profitable.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S3	UGA s international trading could expose it to losses resulting from non-U.S. exchanges that are less developed or less reliable than United States exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Some non-U.S. exchanges may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P92_S5	In addition, UGA may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders, and the historical market data on which USCF bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for U.S. exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P93_S2	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its units may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its units for a taxable year.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to units could be reallocated if the IRS does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects unitholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S4	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S5	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S6	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S7	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S8	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to unitholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S9	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to units, any distributions would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P95_S10	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in units and could substantially reduce the value of the units.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish unitholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. unitholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P97_S3	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the unitholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P97_S4	A unitholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the unitholders reside.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective unitholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	It is each unitholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	the future, UGA may purchase over-the-counter contracts ( OTC Contracts ).
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC Contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by ISDA that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC Contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC Contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC Contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA did not employ any hedging methods such as those described above since all of its investments were made over an exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Therefore, during such period, UGA was not exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	OTC Contracts may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2012, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Auditors Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting To the Partners of United States Gasoline Fund, LP We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Fund s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P1_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P2_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, of the Fund and our report dated March 13, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

1396878_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P4_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership units ( units ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s units traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2012, UGA held 554 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Effective February 29, 2012, UGA issues units to certain authorized purchasers ( Authorized Purchasers ) by offering baskets consisting of 50,000 units ( Creation Baskets ) through ALPS Distributors, Inc., as the marketing agent (the Marketing Agent ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	Prior to February 29, 2012, UGA issued units to Authorized Purchasers by offering baskets consisting of 100,000 units through the Marketing Agent.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	The purchase price for a Creation Basket is based upon the NAV of a unit calculated shortly after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on the day the order to create the basket is properly received.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Units may be purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange in smaller increments than a Creation Basket or Redemption Basket.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Units purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange are not purchased or sold at the per unit NAV of UGA but rather at market prices quoted on such exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	In November 2007, UGA initially registered 30,000,000 units on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its units on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA .
1396878_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	On that day, UGA established its initial per unit NAV by setting the price at $50.00 and issued 300,000 units in exchange for $15,000,000.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	UGA also commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008, by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P18_S4	As of December 31, 2012, UGA had registered a total of 80,000,000 units.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Calculation of Per Unit Net Asset Value UGA s per unit NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of units outstanding.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Net Income (Loss) Per Unit Net income (loss) per unit is the difference between the per unit NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	The weighted average number of units outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average unit.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	The weighted average units are equal to the number of units outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for units added and redeemed based on the amount of time the units were outstanding during such period.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	There were no units held by USCF at December 31, 2012.

1396878_13_ITEM8_P37_S6	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P37_S7	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P37_S8	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P37_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2012, USCF waived $139,446 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P37_S10	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	NOTE 4 - CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The above fee does not include the following expenses, which are also borne by USCF: the cost of placing advertisements in various periodicals; web construction and development; or the printing and production of various marketing materials.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S4	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S5	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S6	an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USDHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USDHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once UGA s, USOF s, USNG s, US12OF s, USDHO s, USSO s, US12NG s, USBO s, USCI s, CPER s, USAG s and USMI s combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S7	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P40_S8	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	UGA has entered into a brokerage agreement with UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	The agreement requires UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	In accordance with the agreement, UBS Securities charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues units as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems units as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P41_S4	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $63,245.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	Of this amount, approximately $58,167 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $5,078 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S3	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2011, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $81,427.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S4	Of this amount, approximately $76,347 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $5,080 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S5	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2010, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $67,294.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S6	Of this amount, approximately $64,040 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $3,254 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S7	The decrease in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily a function of a lower number of futures contracts that were held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S8	The increase in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily a function of increased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S9	The increase in activity during the year ended December 31, 2011 required UGA to trade a greater number of futures contracts and incur a higher amount of commissions.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S10	As an annualized percentage of average daily total net assets, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents approximately 0.07% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S11	By comparison, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2011 represented approximately 0.07% of average daily total net assets and the figure for the year ended December 31, 2010 represented approximately 0.09% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P42_S12	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than USBO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	NOTE 5 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires a futures commission merchant to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the futures commission merchant s proprietary activities.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA were exchange-traded through December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with a futures commission merchant are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the futures commission merchant s segregation requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	In the event of a futures commission merchant s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P53_S3	The insolvency of a futures commission merchant could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that futures commission merchant; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of a futures commission merchant.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P53_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per unit NAV.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in such money market funds.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, UGA held investments in money market funds in the amounts of $47,494,982 and $37,481,350, respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	UGA also holds cash deposits with its custodian.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Pursuant to a written agreement with BBH Co., uninvested overnight cash balances are swept to offshore branches of U.S. regulated and domiciled banks located in Toronto, Canada, London, United Kingdom, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and Nassau, Bahamas, which are subject to U.S. regulation and regulatory oversight.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries in the amounts of $14,075,770 and $35,117,696, respectively, with the custodian and futures commission merchant.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian and/or futures commission merchant cease operations.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	The following table presents per unit performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	An individual unitholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	NOTE 8 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S4	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S5	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P64_S6	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2012 using the fair value hierarchy: During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2011 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-11 require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The guidance requires retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	USCF is currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2011-11 will have on UGA s financial statements.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	NOTE 10 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UGA has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
1396878_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	This evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S0	Controls and Procedures UGA maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in UGA s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S1	The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of UGA if UGA had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UGA s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UGA have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting UGA is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S2	UGA s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to USCF and the Board of USCF regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1396878_13_ITEM9_P0_S5	There were no changes in UGA s internal control over financial reporting during UGA s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UGA s internal control over financial reporting.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P172_S4	Purpose of the Code This Code is intended to:
1396878_13_ITEM14_P173_S0	reaffirm and promote our commitment to a corporate culture that values honesty and accountability.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P173_S1	All employees, as a condition of employment or continued employment, will acknowledge in writing that they have received a copy of this Code, read it, and understand that the Code contains our expectations regarding their conduct.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P173_S2	Finally, you should know that this Code is designed to satisfy the standards contained in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P173_S3	U.S. federal courts are bound to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations when sentencing companies convicted of federal offenses arising from the illegal acts of one or more employees.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P173_S4	The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations provide for substantial leniency in sentencing of a company from otherwise severe mandatory penalties, where the company had in effect an adequate compliance program at the time of the illegal activity.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P174_S0	Conflicts of Interest You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P174_S1	A conflict exists when your personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P174_S2	For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:
1396878_13_ITEM14_P175_S0	you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another s personal benefit.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P177_S2	This policy extends to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and to all other public communications.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P180_S0	Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets Our assets are to be used only for legitimate business purposes.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P180_S1	You should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P180_S2	Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P181_S0	Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P181_S1	Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P182_S0	It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P182_S1	Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P182_S2	You must not trade the units of any Fund, or the securities of our affiliates, our service providers, or any of our other business partners while in the possession of inside information.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P183_S0	It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P183_S1	You must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P184_S0	You must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P184_S1	You may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P184_S2	Please talk to any member of management if you have any questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P185_S0	Equal Opportunity, Harassment We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex or gender, religion, age, national origin, handicap, disability, citizenship status, or any other status protected by law.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P185_S1	With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P185_S2	These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or marital status.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P186_S0	Accuracy of Company Records We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P186_S1	This includes such data as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P186_S2	All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P186_S3	No false or artificial entries may be made.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P187_S0	The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P187_S1	Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P188_S0	From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P188_S1	We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P188_S2	This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P188_S3	If you believe that this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, please contact our Chief Compliance Officer, Howard Mah (the Chief Compliance Officer ).
1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S0	Political Contributions No funds of the Company, of the Trusts or of any Fund may be given directly to political candidates.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S2	We must speak with a unified voice in all dealings with the press and other media.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S3	As a result, the President and CEO is the sole contact for media seeking information about the Company, the Trusts or any Fund.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S4	Any requests from the media must be referred to him.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S5	Unless another individual(s) is so authorized by the President and CEO.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P189_S6	In the event the President and CEO and other authorized individual(s) are not available, clearance must be obtained through the Chief Compliance Officer.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P191_S0	In addition to procedures intended to safeguard against a Fund fact-sheet being misleading or deceptive, it is a USCF policy that Fund fact-sheets may only be distributed to the public when accompanied by the current applicable Fund prospectus.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P192_S0	As noted above, all content to be included on a Fund website is reviewed and approved by USCF s counsel prior to publication of such content on such website.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P192_S1	A review of website information is performed each time new information placed on the website would lead to a substantively new version of the web page.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P192_S2	The review and approval of website material is documented by the supervisor in charge of such review.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P193_S0	USCF does not allow the use of personal websites by its employees or agents for the solicitation of business to any of the Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM14_P194_S0	USCF, or its service providers, maintains the supporting documentation for all statements, claims and performance results referenced in promotional material prepared by or on behalf of the Funds.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P195_S3	Employees who have access to our intellectual property information are obligated to safeguard it from unauthorized access and must:
1396878_13_ITEM14_P196_S0	Not share this information with other employees except on a legitimate need to know basis.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P197_S7	This type of review is performed in conformity with NFA and FINRA guidance on e-mail review, in consideration of the fact that USCF generally communicates with institutional or relatively sophisticated clients, while USCF s marketing agent handles most communication with the general public.

1396878_13_ITEM14_P216_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the Report ) of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Registrant ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof, I, Howard Mah, the Chief Financial Officer of United States Commodity Funds LLC, General Partner of the Registrant, hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge, that: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrant.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P0_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) is a Delaware limited partnership organized on April 13, 2007.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P0_S1	UGA maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P1_S0	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests ( units ) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P1_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P1_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P1_S3	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P1_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P2_S0	UGA s units began trading on February 26, 2008.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S0	USCF is the general partner of UGA and is responsible for the management of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S1	USCF is a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on May 10, 2005.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S2	Prior to June 13, 2008, USCF was known as Victoria Bay Asset Management, LLC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S3	It maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S4	USCF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wainwright Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Wainwright ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S5	Mr. Nicholas Gerber (discussed below) controls Wainwright by virtue of his ownership of Wainwright s shares.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S6	Wainwright is a holding company that previously owned an insurance company organized under Bermuda law (which has been liquidated) and a registered investment adviser firm named Ameristock Corporation, which has been distributed to the Wainwright shareholders.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S7	USCF is a member of the National Futures Association (the NFA ) and registered as a commodity pool operator ( CPO ) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ) on December 1, 2005.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S10	All funds listed previously are referred to collectively herein as the Related Public Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S11	The Related Public Funds are subject to reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P3_S12	For more information about each of the Related Public Funds, investors in UGA may call 1.800.920.0259 or visit www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com or the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	USCF has also filed registration statements to register units of the United States Sugar Fund ( USSF ), the United States Natural Gas Double Inverse Fund ( UNGD ), the United States Gasoil Fund ( USGO ) and the United States Asian Commodities Basket Fund ( UAC ), each of which is a series of the United States Commodity Funds Trust I, and the US Golden Currency Fund ( HARD ), a series of the United States Currency Funds Trust.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P4_S1	USSF, UNGD, USGO and HARD are currently not available to the public as such funds are still in the process of review by various regulatory agencies which have regulatory authority over USCF and such funds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P4_S2	UAC has been declared effective by the regulatory agencies which have regulatory authority over USCF and UAC, but at the time of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, UAC has not been made available to the public.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	USCF is required to evaluate the credit risk of UGA to the futures commission merchant ( FCM ), oversee the purchase and sale of UGA s units by certain authorized purchasers ( Authorized Purchasers ), review daily positions and margin requirements of UGA and manage UGA s investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P5_S1	USCF also pays the fees of ALPS Distributors, Inc., which serves as the marketing agent for UGA (the Marketing Agent ), and Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ), which serves as the administrator (the Administrator ) and the custodian (the Custodian ) for UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P5_S2	Limited partners have no right to elect USCF as the general partner on an annual or any other continuing basis.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P5_S3	If USCF voluntarily withdraws as general partner, however, the holders of a majority of UGA s outstanding units (excluding for purposes of such determination units owned, if any, by the withdrawing USCF and its affiliates) may elect its successor.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P5_S4	USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UGA s outstanding units (excluding units owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of three management directors (the Management Directors ), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	The Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant to its LLC Agreement, as amended from time to time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P6_S2	Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P6_S3	The Board has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis and Malcolm R. Fobes III).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P6_S4	For additional information relating to the audit committee, please see Item 10 .
1396878_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	An investment in the units provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P7_S1	An investment in the units allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded ( over-the-counter ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P8_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P8_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P8_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P9_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P9_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P10_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s units for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P11_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the changes in the price of UGA s units will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, and that changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract will not closely correlate with changes in the spot prices of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P12_S2	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Effective February 29, 2012, the units issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Purchasers and only in blocks of 50,000 units called Creation Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the units in the Creation Basket.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P15_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Purchasers may redeem units and only in blocks of 50,000 units called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P15_S3	Prior to February 29, 2012, Authorized Purchasers could only purchase or redeem units in blocks of 100,000 units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of units in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per unit NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per unit NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per unit NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P16_S3	While UGA issues units only in Creation Baskets, units are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell units at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per unit NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the units traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per unit NAV of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s units traded on the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P18_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P18_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus 10 percent of B , where:
1396878_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s unit price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in UGA s per unit NAV.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UGA s per unit NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract, will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s units on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K. The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P22_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) on UGA s ability to invest in over-the-counter transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as over-the-counter contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P27_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	In 2005, the NYMEX introduced new physical specifications for unleaded gasoline contracts to reflect the changes in the national standards for such fuels.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	Unleaded gasoline using methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) was being phased out and replaced with unleaded gasoline using ethanol.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P29_S3	As a result, NYMEX introduced a new gasoline futures contract in 2005.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P29_S4	The new futures contract trades under the ticker symbol RB .
1396878_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	The pre-existing unleaded gasoline futures contract, ticker symbol HU , ceased trading on December 29th, 2006.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	For a period of approximately 15 months both contracts were traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P34_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflict in Iraq represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P34_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	The heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a Heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	The Heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	In addition, most U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S. based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S4	The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S5	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S6	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S7	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P42_S8	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2012, UGA held 554 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2012, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S4	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S5	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P43_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	In late 2011, the CFTC adopted rules that impose new position limits on Referenced Contracts (as defined below) involving 28 energy, metals and agricultural commodities (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Position Limit Rules were scheduled to become effective on October 12, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S2	However, on September 28, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated these regulations on the basis of ambiguities in the provisions of the CEA (as modified by the Dodd-Frank Act) upon which the regulations were based.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S3	In its September 28, 2012 decision, the court remanded the Position Limit Rules to the CFTC with instructions to use its expertise and experience to resolve the ambiguities in the statute.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S4	On November 15, 2012, the CFTC indicated that it will move forward with an appeal of the District Court s decision to vacate the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S5	At this time, it is not possible to predict how the CFTC s appeal could affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S6	Furthermore, until such time as the appeal is resolved or, if applicable revisions to the Position Limit Rules are proposed and adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the enactment of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S7	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S8	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S9	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the vacated Position Limit Rules would have required the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S10	The CFTC is presently considering new aggregation rules, under a rulemaking proposal that is distinct from the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S11	At this time, it is unclear how any modified aggregation rules may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S12	By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with any potential revised Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P44_S13	See Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P45_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA units, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P46_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P46_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P46_S4	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a FCM.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Liquidity UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	Spot Commodities While the gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	Leverage USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Borrowings Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as over-the-counter contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P54_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	UGA has not employed any hedging methods since all of its investments have been made over an exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Therefore, UGA has not been exposed to counterparty risk.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Pyramiding UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	BBH Co. s principal business address is 50 Milk Street, Boston, MA 02109-3661.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	BBH Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	BBH Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law 160 181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	BBH Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S3	UGA also employs ALPS Distributors, Inc. as the Marketing Agent.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S4	USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P61_S5	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of units exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	ALPS s principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	ALPS is the marketing agent for UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	ALPS is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ) is UGA s FCM.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	UGA and UBS have entered into an Institutional Futures Client Account Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	This agreement requires UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Gasoline Interests that may be purchased or sold by or through UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	UGA pays UBS Securities commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	UBS Securities principal business address is 677 Washington Blvd, Stamford, CT 06901.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	UBS Securities is a futures clearing broker for UGA .

1396878_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	UBS AG, the ultimate parent company to UBS Securities, files annual reports and quarterly reports to the SEC in which it discloses material information about matters involving but not limited to, UBS Securities, including information about any material litigation or regulatory investigations (https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/investor_relations/quarterly_reporting/2011.html).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	Actions with respect to UBS Securities FCM business are publicly available on the website of the National Futures Association (http://www.nfa.futures.org/).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	On June 27, 2007, the Securities Division of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ( Massachusetts Securities Division ) filed an administrative complaint (the Complaint ) and notice of adjudicatory proceeding against UBS Securities, captioned In The Matter of UBS Securities, LLC, Docket No. E-2007-0049, which alleged that UBS Securities violated the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (the Act ) and related regulations by providing the advisers for certain hedge funds with gifts and gratuities in the form of below market office rents, personal loans with below market interest rates, event tickets, and other perks, in order to induce those hedge fund advisers to increase or retain their level of prime brokerage fees paid to UBS Securities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	On November 22, 2010, UBS Securities entered into a Consent Order and Settlement with the Massachusetts Securities Division, pursuant to which UBS Securities agreed to implementing a disclosure policy and retaining an independent consultant to monitor the policy.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	UBS Securities also paid a $100,000 fine.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	In the summer of 2008, the Massachusetts Securities Division, Texas State Securities Board, and the New York Attorney General ( NYAG ) all brought actions against UBS and UBS Financial Services, Inc. ( UBS Financial ), alleging violations of various state law anti-fraud provisions in connection with the marketing and sale of auction rate securities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	On August 8, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial Services reached agreements with the SEC, the NYAG, the Massachusetts Securities Division and other state regulatory agencies represented by the North American Securities Administrators Association ( NASAA ) to restore liquidity to all remaining client s holdings of auction rate securities by June 30, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	On October 2, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial entered into a final consent agreement with the Massachusetts Securities Division settling all allegations in the Massachusetts Securities Division s administrative proceeding against UBS Securities and UBS Financial with regards to the auction rate securities matter.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	On December 11, 2008, UBS Securities and UBS Financial executed an Assurance of Discontinuance in the auction rate securities settlement with the NYAG.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	On the same day, UBS Securities and UBS Financial finalized settlements with the SEC.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	On April 14, 2010, UBS entered into a Consent Order resolving all of the Bureau s claims.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	UBS Securities paid $750,000 to the Bureau for all costs associated with the Bureau s investigation.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	On April 29, 2010, the CFTC issued an order with respect to UBS Securities and levied a fine of $200,000.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Order stated that on February 6, 2009, UBS Securities employee broker aided and abetted UBS Securities customer s concealment of material facts from the NYMEX in violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 13(a)(4) (2006).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Pursuant to NYMEX Rules, a block trade must be reported to NYMEX within five minutes of the time of execution consistent with the requirements of NYMEX Rule 6.21C(A)(6).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	Although the block trade in question was executed earlier in the day, UBS Securities employee broker aided and abetted its customer s concealment of facts when, in response to the customer s request to delay reporting the trade until after the close of trading, UBS Securities employee did not report the trade until after the close.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	Because the employee broker undertook his actions within the scope of his employment, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), and Commission Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. 1.2 (2009), UBS Securities is liable for the employee broker s aiding and abetting of its customer s violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	The fine has been paid and the matter is now closed.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S4	UBS Securities will act only as clearing broker for UGA and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S5	UBS Securities has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K. UBS Securities neither will act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF nor participate in the management of USCF or UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P75_S6	UBS Securities is not affiliated with UGA or USCF.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Currently, USCF does not employ commodity trading advisors for trading of UGA contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	USCF currently does, however, employ a trading advisor for USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC ( SummerHaven ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	If, in the future, USCF does employ commodity trading advisors for UGA, it will choose each advisor based on arm s-length negotiations and will consider the advisor s experience, fees and reputation.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	(2) The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	USCF also will pay transaction charge fees to BBH Co., ranging from $7.00 to $15.00 per transaction for the funds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	Compensation to USCF UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on 0.60% per annum on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P79_S3	Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of total net assets on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	Total net assets are calculated by taking the current market value of UGA s total assets and subtracting any liabilities.

1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Form of Units Registered Form .
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	Units are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring units in certificated form.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S3	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the units in certificated form in the registry (the Register ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S4	USCF recognizes transfers of units in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S5	The beneficial interests in such units are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S6	Individual certificates are not issued for the units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S7	Instead, units are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P92_S8	The global certificates evidence all of the units outstanding at any time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	Unitholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the units through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding units through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P93_S2	Units are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Calculating Per Unit NAV UGA s per unit NAV is calculated by:
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	The Administrator calculates the per unit NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S2	The per unit NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S3	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S4	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S5	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S6	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S7	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S8	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S9	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per unit NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S10	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P97_S11	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The indicative fund value unit basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per unit NAV, because the per unit NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per unit basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S4	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S5	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s units are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S6	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S7	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P98_S8	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA units on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S4	If the market price of UGA units diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S5	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA units on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P99_S6	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Creation and Redemption of Units UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P100_S2	Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P100_S3	Authorized Purchasers must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or unitholder or Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012 (and continuing at least through May 1, 2013), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P102_S2	As of December 31, 2012, 13 Authorized Purchasers had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P102_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA issued 19 Creation Baskets and redeemed 41 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	In some cases, Authorized Purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P103_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Purchaser s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	Each Authorized Purchaser is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P104_S2	Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, USCF has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K. Creation Procedures On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S2	Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a creation request.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S3	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S4	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P109_S5	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s purchase of units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	Determination of Required Deposits The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of units to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P111_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	Delivery of Required Deposits An Authorized Purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Purchaser s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S3	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S4	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P112_S5	UGA s per unit NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Rejection of Purchase Orders USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	Redemption Procedures The procedures by which an Authorized Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual unitholder to redeem any units in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S5	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S6	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S7	An Authorized Purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S8	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S9	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P115_S10	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s sale of units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	Determination of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of units to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S3	Delivery of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S4	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S5	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S6	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P117_S7	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Purchaser Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of units being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding units to 100,000 units ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012 (and continuing at least through May 1, 2013), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P120_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P120_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P120_S4	Tax Responsibility Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	Secondary Market Transactions As noted, UGA creates and redeems units from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S2	An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public units of any baskets it does create.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S3	Authorized Purchasers that do offer to the public units from the baskets they create will do so at per-unit offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Purchaser purchased the Creation Baskets and the per unit NAV of the units at the time of the offer of the units to the public, the supply of and demand for units at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S4	The prices of units offered by Authorized Purchasers are expected to fall between UGA s per unit NAV and the trading price of the units on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P122_S5	Units initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Purchaser on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of units.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	Units trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S3	Units may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per unit NAV.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S4	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per unit NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell units in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S5	While the units trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P123_S6	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the units may widen.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Investments USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P127_S2	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	A FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P129_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (retail, eligible contract participant, or eligible commercial entity), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	The offer and sale of units of UGA, as well as units of each of the Related Public Funds is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P133_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of units are regulated as described above, as well as by the self regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S3	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S4	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P134_S5	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P135_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the over-the-counter markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P136_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets will be regulated by the CFTC once the Dodd-Frank Act is fully implemented.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	At a minimum, over-the-counter currency forwards, options and swaps will be subject to heightened recordkeeping, reporting and business conduct standards.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P137_S3	On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P137_S4	The final determination does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	Options on Futures Contracts Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S4	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S5	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S6	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S7	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P144_S8	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	Options on Forward Contracts or Commodities Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	Swap Contracts Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P150_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P150_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P150_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that UGA is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	On August 13, 2012, the CFTC and the SEC published joint final rules defining the terms swap and security- based swap.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	The term swap is broadly defined to include various types of over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps and options.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	The effective date of these final rules was October 12, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (which are referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P154_S1	On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCOs.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P154_S2	This is the CFTC s first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P154_S3	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P155_S2	On May 23, 2012, the CFTC published final regulations, which became effective as of July 23, 2012, to determine which entities will be regulated as swap dealers and major swap participants and thus have to comply with these capital and margin requirements (as well as a multitude of other requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act).
1396878_13_ITEM15_P155_S3	Most of the requirements became effective on October 12, 2012, when additional final rules defining the terms swap, security-based swap, and mixed swap became effective.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P155_S4	However, on October 11, 2012 and October 12, 2012, the CFTC issued several no-action letters and interpretive guidance which delayed much of the implementation of these requirements from October 12, 2012 until December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Increased regulation of, and the imposition of additional costs on, swap transactions could have an adverse effect on UGA by, for example, reducing the size of and therefore liquidity in the derivatives market, increasing transaction costs and decreasing the ability to customize derivative transactions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	On February 7, 2012, the CFTC published a rule requiring each FCM and DCO to segregate cleared swaps and related collateral posted by a customer of the FCM from the assets of the FCM or DCO, although such property can be commingled with the property of other cleared swaps customers of the FCM or DCO.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S1	This rule addresses losses incurred by a DCO in a so-called double default scenario in which a customer of a FCM defaults in its obligations to the FCM and the FCM, in turn, defaults in its obligations to the DCO.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S2	Under this scenario, the DCO can only access the collateral attributable to other customers of the DCO whose cleared swap positions are in a loss position following the primary customer s default.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S3	This rule became effective on November 8, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S4	Some market participants have expressed concern that the requirements of this segregation rule may result in higher initial margins or higher fees.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P157_S5	UGA does not anticipate any impact to its operations in order to meet the requirements of the new rule.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Additionally, the CFTC published rules on February 17, 2012 and April 3, 2012 that require swap dealers and major swap participants to: 1) adhere to business conduct standards, 2) implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the CEA and 3) maintain records of such compliance.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P158_S1	These new requirements may impact the documentation requirements for both cleared and non-cleared swaps and cause swap dealers and major swap participants to face increased compliance costs that, in turn, may be passed along to counterparties (such as UGA) in the form of higher fees and expenses related to trading swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	On February 24, 2012, the CFTC amended certain disclosure obligations to require that the operator of a commodity pool that invests in swaps include standardized swap risk disclosures in the pool s disclosure documents by December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	On December 5, 2012, the CFTC s Division of Market Oversight issued a letter providing swap dealers with time-limited no-action relief from swap data reporting obligations with respect to equity swaps, foreign exchange swaps and other commodity swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P159_S2	For these asset classes, the letter provides swap dealers with reporting relief (i) with respect to real-time price reporting and regular swap reporting (under Part 43 and Part 45 of the CFTC s regulations, respectively), until February 28, 2013, and (ii) historical swap reporting requirements (under Part 46 of the CFTC s regulations) until March 30, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	On December 21, 2012, the CFTC s Division of Market Oversight issued two letters providing certain swap dealers with time-limited no-action relief from some swap data reporting obligations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P160_S1	One letter provides relief from reporting requirements for branches of swap dealers located in emerging markets who encounter technical difficulties in complying with the reporting rules.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	The letter also provides that swap dealers may delay reporting compliance for certain complex and exotic swaps until April 30, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P160_S3	Under a second letter, all swap dealers have until April 10, 2013 to report certain information about their counterparties, including: status as a major swap participant, a financial entity, a U.S. person or a commercial end-user.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	On December 18, 2012, the CFTC deferred the compliance date for many of the Dodd-Frank Act s external business conduct standards from December 31, 2012 to May 1, 2013, and for some requirements to July 1, 2013, providing swap dealers an additional four to six months from the original compliance date.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P162_S0	Regulation Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P162_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P163_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P163_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P163_S3	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S3	The CEA also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S4	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants unitholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P164_S5	Unitholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P165_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P165_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P166_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P166_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P166_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P167_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P167_S1	The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P168_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P168_S2	The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P169_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P169_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P170_S0	On November 14, 2012, the CFTC proposed new regulations that would require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P170_S1	The proposed rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations, and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P170_S2	The final regulations have not yet been adopted.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P171_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P171_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or a FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law, as exemplified by the various discussions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P173_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P174_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P174_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts traded on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	In October 2011, the CFTC finalized the Position Limit Rules, which were scheduled to become effective on October 12, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S1	However, on September 28, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated these regulations on the basis of ambiguities in the provisions of the CEA (as modified by the Dodd-Frank Act) upon which the regulations were based.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S2	In its September 28, 2012 decision, the court remanded the Position Limit Rules to the CFTC with instructions to use its expertise and experience to resolve the ambiguities in the statute.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S3	On November 15, 2012, the CFTC indicated that it will move forward with an appeal of the District Court s decision to vacate the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S4	At this time, it is not possible to predict how the CFTC s appeal could affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S5	Furthermore, until such time as the appeal is resolved or, if applicable revisions to the Position Limit Rules are proposed and adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the enactment of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S6	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S7	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the vacated Position Limit Rules would have required the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S8	The CFTC is presently considering new aggregation rules, under a rulemaking proposal that is distinct from the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S9	At this time, it is unclear how any modified aggregation rules may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S10	By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with any potential revised Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P175_S11	Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of UGA to achieve its investment objective.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P176_S0	Commodity Margin Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P176_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S4	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S5	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P178_S6	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	Regulators have not yet finalized the Dodd-Frank Act rules regarding initial margin levels for over-the-counter derivatives.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S1	It is possible that such levels may be higher than those for futures contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S2	Also, initial margin requirements for non-cleared swaps will be subject to higher margin requirements than cleared swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S3	And, under pending rule proposals, UGA may be required to post, but not be entitled to receive, initial and variation margin in respect of non-cleared swaps.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S4	Until such time as the regulators finalize these margin rules, trading in the over-the-counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally will not require margin per se.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S5	Rather, it will involve the extension of credit between counterparties that is secured by transfers of credit support and/or independent amounts.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P179_S6	Credit support is transferred between counterparties in respect of the open over-the-counter derivatives entered into between them, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the execution of a particular over-the-counter transaction.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P180_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P182_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P182_S2	If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P182_S3	With respect to UGA s trading, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P182_S4	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	SEC Reports UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_13_ITEM15_P183_S2	CFTC Reports UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per unit NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law, as exemplified by the various discussions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some specific examples of how the new Dodd-Frank Act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact USGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. Price Movements Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2012 and exhibited a general upward trend throughout the year.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $2.6574 per gallon.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	Prices rose sharply over the course of the year and hit a peak on March 26, 2012 of $3.3987 per gallon.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.7617 per gallon, up approximately 3.92% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	UGA s per unit NAV rose during the year from a starting level of $48.37 to a high of $61.56 on September 11, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S8	UGA s per unit NAV reached its low for the year on June 21, 2012 at $45.25.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P5_S9	UGA s per unit NAV on December 31, 2012 was $58.39, up approximately 20.72% over the year.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2012 contract and ended with the February 2013 contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase of approximately 3.92% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the gasoline futures market was primarily in a state of backwardation, with brief periods of mild contango at the start of the year and again in early December 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The per unit NAV of UGA s units is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The per unit NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Results of Operations and the Gasoline Market Results of Operations.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its units on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per unit and issued 300,000 units to the initial Authorized Purchaser, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s units no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 units, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its units: 50,000,000 units which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	As of December 31, 2012, UGA had issued 8,750,000 units, 1,100,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2012, there were 71,250,000 units registered but not yet issued.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	More units may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, units that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	As of December 31, 2012, UGA had the following authorized purchasers: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., NewEdge USA LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets Corporation, SG Americas Securities LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S14	The increase in the per unit NAV for December 31, 2012, as compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the impact of backwardation and the increase in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract between the year ended December 31, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P11_S15	By comparison, as of December 31, 2010, the total unrealized gain on gasoline Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $3,265,416 and UGA established cash deposits and investments in money market funds that were equal to $63,925,522.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P13_S8	The increase in gross total expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to an increased amortization rate for registration expenses and an increased share of directors fees and expenses being borne by UGA during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P13_S9	The decrease in gross total expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to decreased estimates for tax reporting, auditing and other costs during the year ended December 31, 2011.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	The decrease in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the non-incurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was amortized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P14_S7	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2010, these fees and expenses amounted to a total of $1,107,140 for UGA and the Related Public Funds, except USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P14_S9	The decrease in directors fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to the non-incurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, the majority of which was amortized in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P14_S10	Effective as of April 1, 2010, UGA became responsible for paying its portion of any payments that may become due to the independent directors pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements entered into between the independent directors, USCF, UGA, and the Related Public Funds, except USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	Of this amount, approximately $64,040 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $3,254 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S7	The decrease in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily a function of a lower number of futures contracts that were held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S8	The increase in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily a function of increased redemptions and creations of units during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S9	The increase in activity during the year ended December 31, 2011 required UGA to trade a greater number of futures contracts and incur a higher amount of commissions.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S10	As an annualized percentage of average daily total net assets, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents approximately 0.07% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S11	By comparison, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2011 represented approximately 0.07% of average daily total net assets and the figure for the year ended December 31, 2010 represented approximately 0.09% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P15_S12	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	These costs are estimated to be $225,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2012, USCF waived $139,446 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Dividend and Interest Income .
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the FCM as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned $26,007 in dividend and interest income on such Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of approximately 0.03%.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S9	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of approximately 0.02% and 0.04%, respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S10	UGA purchased Treasuries during the year ended December 31, 2011 and also held cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S11	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the year ended December 31, 2010 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S12	Interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 and lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P17_S13	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 and lower as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Portfolio Expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the average daily total net assets of UGA were $64,456,487.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	The management fee incurred by UGA during the period amounted to $97,214.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2011, the average daily total net assets of UGA were $77,734,009.

1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S6	The management fee paid by UGA during the period amounted to $93,489.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S7	In addition to the management fee, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses, including tax reporting costs, licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, ongoing registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S8	The gross total of these fees and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2012 was $119,329, as compared to $23,791 for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and $96,805 for the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S9	The increase in gross total expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to UGA s increased audit and tax reporting expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S10	The decrease in gross total expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of tax reporting and audit expenses expected for the three months ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S11	For the three months ended December 31, 2012, UGA incurred $11,709 in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S12	By comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, UGA incurred $2,300 and $2,300, respectively, in ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S13	The increase in registration fees and expenses incurred by UGA for the three months ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to an increased amortization schedule during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S14	The registration fees and expenses incurred by UGA for the three months ended December 31, 2011 were equivalent as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S15	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, a voluntary expense waiver was in effect to offset certain of the expenses incurred by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S16	During the three months ended December 31, 2011, UGA s expenses did not exceed 0.15% (15 basis points) of its NAV; therefore, no expenses were waived by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S17	During the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, the total amount of the expense waiver was $64,418 and $52,143, respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P18_S18	For the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, the expenses of UGA, including management fees, commissions, and all other expenses, before allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $216,543 and $190,294, respectively, and after allowance for the expense waiver, totaled $152,125 and $131,151, respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance of UGA and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UGA and the Related Public Funds organized as limited partnerships and, as of July 8, 2011, the Related Public Funds organized as a series of a Delaware statutory trust.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	UGA shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to a total of 540,586 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	UGA s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $18,888.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or Treasuries.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $11,642.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Of this amount, approximately $11,311 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $331 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2011, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $15,051.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	Of this amount, approximately $14,330 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $721 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	By comparison, during the three months ended December 31, 2010, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $12,686.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Of this amount, approximately $12,289 was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $397 was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	The decrease in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011, was primarily a function of a lower number of futures contracts that were held and traded during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	The increase in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010, was primarily a function of increased redemption and creation activity during the three months ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S9	As an annualized percentage of average daily total net assets, the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2012 represents approximately 0.07% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S10	By comparison, the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2011 represented approximately 0.08% of average daily total net assets and the figure for the three months ended December 31, 2010 represented approximately 0.08% of average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P20_S11	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	These costs are estimated to be $225,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceed 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	For the three months ended December 31, 2012, USCF waived $64,418 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Dividend and Interest Income .
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	UGA seeks to invest its assets such that it holds Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Typically, such investments do not require UGA to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase, but rather require UGA to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a result, UGA retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets, which UGA invests in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	This includes both the amount on deposit with the FCM as margin, as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with UGA s Custodian.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	For the three months ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned $6,031 in dividend and interest income on such Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of approximately 0.04%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S7	UGA purchased Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2012 and also held cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S8	By comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, UGA earned $3,851 and $7,637, respectively, in dividend and interest income on such Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S9	Based on UGA s average daily total net assets, this was equivalent to an annualized yield of approximately 0.02% and 0.05%, respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S10	UGA purchased Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2011 and also held cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S11	UGA did not purchase Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2010 and held only cash and/or cash equivalents during this time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S12	Interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2012 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011 and lower compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P22_S13	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011 and lower as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that average daily changes in its per unit NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the average daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per unit NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per unit NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per unit NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2012, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.128%, while the simple average daily change in the per unit NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.124%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The average daily difference was 0.004% (or 0.4 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	NAV was (1.723)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per unit NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract since inception.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	Since the commencement of the offering of UGA units to the public on February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2012, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.046%, while the simple average daily change in the per unit NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.043%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S6	The average daily difference was 0.002% (or 0.2 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P24_S7	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per unit NAV was 0.833%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per unit NAV, versus the expected changes in its per unit NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 20.72%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	This is based on an initial per unit NAV of $48.37 on December 31, 2011 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2012 of $58.39.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $58.89 as of December 31, 2012, for a total return over the relevant time period of 21.75%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 20.72% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 21.75% was an error over the time period of (1.03)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $26,007, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.03% for such period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA also collected $12,250 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA incurred net expenses of $803,038.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(764,781), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.83)% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 15.00%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	This was based on an initial per unit NAV of $42.06 on December 31, 2010 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2011 of $48.37.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $48.76 as of December 31, 2011, for a total return over the relevant time period of 15.93%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 15.00% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 15.93% was an error over the time period of (0.93)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $19,169, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.02% for such period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA also collected $26,200 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA incurred net expenses of $943,859.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(898,490), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.80)% for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2010, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per unit NAV was 15.52%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S6	This was based on an initial per unit NAV of $36.41 on December 31, 2009 and an ending per unit NAV as of December 31, 2010 of $42.06.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S7	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its unitholders.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S8	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per unit NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per unit NAV of $42.42 as of December 31, 2010, for a total return over the relevant time period of 16.51%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S9	The difference between the actual per unit NAV total return of UGA of 15.52% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 16.51% was an error over the time period of (0.99)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P28_S10	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $31,732, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.04% for such period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA also collected $16,000 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, UGA incurred net expenses of $651,200.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(603,468), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.84)% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the daily changes in the per unit NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Second, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its unitholders and did not make any distributions to unitholders during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per unit NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned, on an annualized basis, approximately 0.03% on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	It also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of 0.60% for management fees, approximately 0.07% in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts, and approximately 0.21% for other net expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The foregoing fees and expenses resulted in a net yield on an annualized basis of approximately (0.85)% and affected UGA s ability to track its benchmark.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per unit NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S5	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P35_S6	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per unit NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	Using the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 8%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Using again the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	In this example, it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years for gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P42_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Investors will further note that the markets display a very seasonal pattern that corresponds to the seasonal demand patterns for gasoline mentioned above.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	That is, in many, but not all cases, the price of the near month is higher than the next month during the middle of the summer months as the price of gasoline for delivery in those summer months rises to meet peak demand.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	At the same time, the price of the near month contract, when that month is just before the onset of spring, does not rise as far or as fast as the price of a next month contract whose delivery falls closer to the start of the summer season.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its units match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA units during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	For example, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2011 and held to December 31, 2012 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by approximately 20.72%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 3.92% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA units made on December 31, 2010 and held to December 31, 2011 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA units on those days, by approximately 15.00%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 9.34% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per unit NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s units and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was impacted by several factors.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	In particular, USCF believes that falling crude oil prices, both in the United States and in London, were somewhat offset by a reduction in gasoline refinery capacity on the East Coast of the United States, near the New York harbor where the Benchmark Futures Contracts is priced, resulting in a net increase in gasoline prices.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2012 at $2.6574 per gallon.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	It rose over the course of the year and hit a peak on March 26, 2012 of $3.3987 per gallon.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.7617 per gallon, up approximately 3.92% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	On the consumption side, demand moderated inside and outside the United States as global economic growth, including emerging economies such as China and India, showed signs of slowing economic growth.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Europe in particular showed signs of weakness as the ongoing financial and banking crisis raised concerns during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	On the supply side, efforts to reduce production by OPEC to more closely match global consumption were partially successful.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	In the summer of 2011, production had been disrupted by political unrest in the Middle East, particularly Libya, which reduced global supply by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	A partial resolution of the Libyan situation has reduced concerns regarding the global supply of crude oil.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	However, continuing concerns about the political standoff with Iran have left the market subject to bouts of heightened volatility as OPEC s ability to replace Iranian oil currently subject to embargo is not unlimited.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	In recent years, oil production in the United States has increased, particularly in the Midwest.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, limits on oil transportation infrastructure, including pipelines, have made it more difficult for the increased production to move to the centers of refining, often leading to a build-up in crude oil inventory in the U.S. Midwest.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The result is that crude oil prices in the middle of the United States, where the pricing point of the light, sweet crude oil contract is located, have tended to trade at a lower price than crude oil in other parts of the United States or globally.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	United States crude oil prices finished 2012 approximately 7.1% lower than at the beginning of the year, as the global economy continues to adjust to periods of slow recovery and economic growth.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	USCF believes that should the global economic situation cease to improve, or decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels, while any military actions involving Iran would likely have the opposite effect.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	For the ten year time period between 2003 and 2012, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of unleaded gasoline on a monthly basis was not strongly correlated, positively or negatively, with the movements of natural gas, large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds or global equities.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	However, movements in unleaded gasoline had moderate to strong correlation to movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2012, unleaded gasoline continued to have a moderately positive correlation with crude oil, diesel-heating oil, large cap U.S. equities and global equities.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Unleaded gasoline, however, had a negative moderate correlation with natural gas, as compared to the relatively positive correlation during the longer time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Finally, the results showed that unleaded gasoline and U.S. government bonds, which were not strongly correlated, positively or negatively, for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2012, had a negative, moderate correlation over this more recent time period.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per unit NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with daily changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P62_S5	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming units, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its over-the-counter contracts and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at the Custodian and in investments in Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, UGA was forced to use other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a drop in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S8	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S9	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S10	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S11	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S12	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S13	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P64_S14	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA was not forced to purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Since the initial offering of units, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of units.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Market Risk Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S7	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P66_S8	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Credit Risk When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	UBS Securities, UGA s commodity broker, or any other broker that may be retained by UGA in the future, when acting as UGA s FCM in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases over-the-counter contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	As of December 31, 2012, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $61,570,752 with the Custodian and FCM.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should the Custodian and/or FCM cease operations.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Off Balance Sheet Financing As of December 31, 2012, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem units, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 units as of February 29, 2012 called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of units being redeemed.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Contractual Obligations UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its units with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	However, since UGA s initial offering of units, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional units of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of the Custodian and Transfer Agent, BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than USBO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2013.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S6	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to a FCM), over-the-counter dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P77_S7	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Commission payments to a FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per unit NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2012, UGA s portfolio consisted of 554 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2012, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.unitedstatesgasolinefund.com.

1396878_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	UGA maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests ( shares ) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).

1396878_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	On December 30, 2013, USCF withdrew the registration statements for USSF, UNGD, USGO and UAC effective December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	On January 27, 2014, USCF withdrew the registration statement for HARD.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	HARD was never available to the public, and at the time of withdrawal, HARD was still in the process of review by various regulatory agencies which have regulatory authority over USCF and HARD.

1396878_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	If USCF voluntarily withdraws as general partner, however, the holders of a majority of UGA s outstanding shares (excluding for purposes of such determination shares owned, if any, by the withdrawing USCF and its affiliates) may elect its successor.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UGA s outstanding shares (excluding shares owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of three management directors (the Management Directors ), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

1396878_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded ( over-the-counter ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the changes in the price of UGA s shares will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, and that changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract will not closely correlate with changes in the spot prices of gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Effective February 29, 2012, the shares issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Purchasers and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Creation Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Purchasers may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	Prior to February 29, 2012, Authorized Purchasers could only purchase or redeem shares in blocks of 100,000 shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	While UGA issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares traded on the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track on a daily basis the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus 10 percent of B , where:
1396878_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s share price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in UGA s per share NAV.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UGA s per share NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract, will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UGA s ability to invest in over-the-counter transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as over-the-counter contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	In 2005, the NYMEX introduced new physical specifications for unleaded gasoline contracts to reflect the changes in the national standards for such fuels.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Unleaded gasoline using methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) was being phased out and replaced with unleaded gasoline using ethanol.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	As a result, NYMEX introduced a new gasoline futures contract in 2005.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	The new futures contract trades under the ticker symbol RB .
1396878_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The pre-existing unleaded gasoline futures contract, ticker symbol HU , ceased trading on December 29th, 2006.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	For a period of approximately 15 months both contracts were traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	The heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a Heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	The Heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition, most U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S. based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P53_S5	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2013, UGA held 486 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2013, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: over-the-counter ( OTC ), DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Furthermore, until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P56_S6	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	See Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	While the gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as over-the-counter contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	These EFR transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the over-the-counter component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFR transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	During the 12 month reporting period ended December 31, 2013, UGA limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts and EFR transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.

1396878_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.

1396878_14_ITEM1_P117_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P117_S4	The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P118_S1	Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P118_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated by:
1396878_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S4	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S5	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P124_S6	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P125_S2	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P125_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S2	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S3	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S4	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S5	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S6	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S7	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P126_S8	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P127_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA shares on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P128_S2	If the market price of UGA shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P128_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P128_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P129_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P130_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P131_S2	The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through May 1, 2014), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P132_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P132_S2	As of December 31, 2013, 13 Authorized Purchasers had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P132_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA issued 7 Creation Baskets and redeemed 10 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	In some cases, Authorized Purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Purchaser s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	Each Authorized Purchaser is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P134_S2	Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, USCF has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P137_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P139_S2	Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a creation request.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P140_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P140_S2	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s purchase of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P142_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	An Authorized Purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Purchaser s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P144_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P145_S1	UGA s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P148_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P149_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P149_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P149_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P149_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P149_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Purchaser.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P150_S0	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P150_S1	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P150_S2	An Authorized Purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P151_S0	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P151_S1	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P151_S2	If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P152_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Purchaser s sale of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P153_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P153_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P153_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P154_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P154_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P154_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P154_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P154_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P155_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P155_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P155_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P155_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P156_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P156_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Purchaser Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P156_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P157_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P157_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through May 1, 2014), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P157_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P157_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P158_S0	Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P159_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P159_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S1	Authorized Purchasers must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S2	An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S3	Authorized Purchasers that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Purchaser purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S4	The prices of shares offered by Authorized Purchasers are expected to fall between UGA s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P160_S5	Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P161_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Purchaser on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P161_S1	Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P162_S0	Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P162_S1	Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P162_S2	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P162_S3	While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P162_S4	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P163_S0	USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P163_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P164_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P164_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P165_S0	Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P165_S1	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P165_S2	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_14_ITEM1_P166_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P167_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P167_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P168_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P168_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P168_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P169_S0	A FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P169_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P170_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P171_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P171_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (retail, eligible contract participant, or eligible commercial entity), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P172_S0	The offer and sale of shares of UGA, as well as shares of each of the Related Public Funds is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P173_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P173_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P174_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P174_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P174_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P175_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P175_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P175_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P176_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P176_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P176_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the over-the-counter markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P177_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P178_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P178_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P178_S2	At a minimum, over-the-counter currency forwards, options and swaps will be subject to heightened recordkeeping, reporting and business conduct standards.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P179_S0	On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P179_S1	The final determination does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P180_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P180_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P180_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P181_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P181_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P181_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P182_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P182_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P182_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P183_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P183_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P184_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P184_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P185_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P185_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P185_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P185_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P186_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P186_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P186_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P186_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P186_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P187_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P188_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P188_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P188_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P189_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P189_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P190_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P190_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P190_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P191_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P191_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P192_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P192_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P192_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P192_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P193_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) imposes regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that UGA is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objective.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P194_S0	On August 13, 2012, the CFTC and the SEC published joint final rules defining the terms swap and security- based swap.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P195_S0	The term swap is broadly defined to include various types of over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps and options.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P195_S1	The effective date of these final rules was October 12, 2012.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (which are referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S1	On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCOs.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S2	This is the CFTC s first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S3	Beginning on March 11, 2013, swap dealers, major swap participants and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps; and beginning on June 10, 2013, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S4	As a result, if UGA enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after June 10, 2013, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P196_S5	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P197_S0	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P197_S1	Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P198_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that certain swaps determined to be available to trade on a SEF must be executed over such a facility.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P198_S1	On June 5, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule regarding the obligations of SEFs, including the obligation for facilities offering multiple person execution services to register as a SEF by October 2, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P198_S2	Based upon applications filed by several SEFs with the CFTC, the CFTC has determined that certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps are available to trade on SEFs and beginning on February 15, 2014, certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps must be executed on a SEF.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P199_S0	On November 14, 2013, the CFTC s Division of Clearing and Risk, Division of Market Oversight and Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight published guidance with respect to the application of certain CFTC rules on SEFs.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P199_S1	That guidance clarified that SEFs could not restrict access to participants who are permitted to trade swaps and that SEFs may not require participants to have breakage agreements in place with other counterparties.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P200_S0	On April 11, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P200_S1	The rule permits affiliated counterparties to elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement, if, among other things, the counterparties are majority-owned affiliates whose financial statements are included in the same consolidated financial statements and whose swaps are documented and subject to a centralized risk management program.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P200_S2	However, the exemption does not apply to swaps entered into by affiliated counterparties with unaffiliated counterparties.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P201_S0	Additionally, the CFTC published rules on February 17, 2012 and April 3, 2012 that require swap dealers and major swap participants to: 1) adhere to business conduct standards, 2) implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the CEA and 3) maintain records of such compliance.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P201_S1	These new requirements may impact the documentation requirements for both cleared and non-cleared swaps and cause swap dealers and major swap participants to face increased compliance costs that, in turn, may be passed along to counterparties (such as UGA) in the form of higher fees and expenses related to trading swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P202_S0	On April 5, 2013, the CFTC s Division of Clearing and Risk issued a letter granting no-action relief from certain swap data reporting requirements for swaps entered into between affiliated counterparties.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P202_S1	In general, the letter grants relief from, among others: real-time, historical and regular swap reporting (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC s regulations, respectively.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P203_S0	On April 9, 2013, the CFTC s Division of Market Oversight issued a letter granting time-limited no-action relief to non-swap dealer, non-major swap participant counterparties from the real-time, regular and historical swap reporting requirements (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC s regulations, respectively).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P204_S0	The regular reporting requirements (Part 45 of the CFTC regulations) for interest rate and credit swaps of a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as UGA) began on April 10, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P204_S1	The letter delays implementation of the reporting requirements based upon the asset class underlying the swap and the classification of the reporting counterparty.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P204_S2	For a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as UGA), regular reporting requirements for equity, foreign exchange and other commodity swaps (including swaps on gasoline) began on May 29, 2013 and reporting of all historical swaps for all asset classes began on September 30, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P205_S0	On November 6, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P205_S1	In other words, the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by UGA in connection with uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P206_S0	In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation ( EMIR ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P206_S1	These regulations have not yet been fully implemented.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S0	On August 12, 2013, the CFTC issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators ( CPOs ) of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ) that are required to register due to recent changes to CFTC Regulation 4.5.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S1	The final rules were issued in a CFTC release entitled Harmonization of Compliance Obligations for Registered Investment Companies Required to Register as Commodity Pool Operators.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S2	For entities that are registered with both the CFTC and the SEC, the CFTC will accept the SEC s disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping regime as substituted compliance for substantially all of Part 4 of the CFTC s regulations, so long as they comply with comparable requirements under the SEC s statutory and regulatory compliance regime.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S3	Thus, the final rules (the Harmonization Rules ) allow dually registered entities to meet certain CFTC regulatory requirements for CPOs by complying with SEC rules to which they are already subject.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S4	Although UGA is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Harmonization Rules amended certain CFTC disclosure rules to make the requirements for all CPOs to periodically update their disclosure documents consistent with those of the SEC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S5	This change will decrease the burden to UGA and USCF of having to comply with inconsistent regulatory requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P207_S6	It is not known whether the CFTC will make additional amendments to its disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules to further harmonize these obligations with those of the SEC as they apply to UGA and USCF, but any such further rule changes could result in additional operating efficiencies for UGA and USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P208_S0	With regard to any other rules that the CFTC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P209_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P209_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P210_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P210_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P210_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P211_S0	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P212_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P212_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P212_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P213_S0	The CEA also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P214_S0	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P214_S1	Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P215_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P215_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P215_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P216_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P216_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P216_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P217_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P218_S0	The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P219_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P219_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P219_S2	The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P220_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P220_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P220_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P221_S0	On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P221_S1	The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P222_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P222_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P223_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or a FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO and their respective associated persons.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P224_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law, as exemplified by the various discussions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P224_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P225_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P225_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P225_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts traded on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S3	Furthermore, until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S4	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S5	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P226_S6	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P227_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P227_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P227_S2	By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P228_S0	Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of UGA to achieve its investment objective.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P229_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P229_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P230_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P230_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P231_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P231_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P231_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P231_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P232_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P232_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P232_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S0	Regulators have not yet finalized the Dodd-Frank Act rules regarding initial margin levels for over-the-counter derivatives.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S1	It is possible that such levels may be higher than those for futures contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S2	Also, initial margin requirements for non-cleared swaps will be subject to higher margin requirements than cleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S3	And, under pending rule proposals, UGA may be required to post, but not be entitled to receive, initial and variation margin in respect of non-cleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S4	Until such time as the regulators finalize these margin rules, trading in the over-the-counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally will not require margin per se.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S5	Rather, it will involve the extension of credit between counterparties that is secured by transfers of credit support and/or independent amounts.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P233_S6	Credit support is transferred between counterparties in respect of the open over-the-counter derivatives entered into between them, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the execution of a particular over-the-counter transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P234_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P234_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P234_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P235_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P236_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P236_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P236_S2	If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P236_S3	With respect to UGA s trading, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P237_S0	On November 6, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P237_S1	In other words, the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by UGA in connection with uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1_P238_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.

1396878_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily percentage change in the net asset value per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of unleaded gasoline, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that the daily changes in its net asset value, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	UGA s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in unleaded gasoline and to hedge against movements in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	An investment in UGA involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in UGA involves tax risks, over-the-counter risks, and other risks.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The net asset value of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by UGA and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the net asset value of its shares to track the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The net asset value of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of unleaded gasoline in the marketplace.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for unleaded gasoline correlates closely with general economic growth rates.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on unleaded gasoline prices.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Other factors that may affect the demand for unleaded gasoline and therefore its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for unleaded gasoline associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce unleaded gasoline prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The supply of and demand for unleaded gasoline may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Investing in UGA s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks:
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than net asset value.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Daily percentage changes in net asset value may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than net asset value.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	UGA s net asset value per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of UGA s portfolio investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the net asset value of the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the unleaded gasoline and the Benchmark Futures Contract at any point in time.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Purchasers and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track net asset value per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The net asset value of UGA s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet, light unleaded gasoline trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global gasoline market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the net asset value of the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Daily percentage changes in UGA s net asset value may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in UGA s net asset value per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for unleaded gasoline, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As UGA approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, UGA may begin investing in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, UGA is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract because the total return generated by UGA is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with UGA s trading activities, and increased by interest income from UGA s holdings of Treasury securities.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract requires trading of UGA s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract and the spot price of unleaded gasoline may at times be only approximate.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Futures Contract) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and technical influences in oil futures trading.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Natural forces in the oil futures market known as backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In the event of an unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Conversely, in the event of a unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of unleaded gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of UGA s per share net asset value to vary significantly.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per share net asset value and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located trading platforms.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products ( e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products ( e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investment subject to these limits.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in unleaded gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed unleaded gasoline futures.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Currently, over-the-counter transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade over-the-counter Gasoline Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Currently, over-the-counter contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act had been essentially unregulated by the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The markets for over-the-counter contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	To date, the forward markets have been largely unregulated, forward contracts have been executed bi-laterally and, in general, forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The final determination does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, certain currency swaps and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	While the Dodd-Frank Act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over-the-counter market, the current regulation of the over-the-counter contracts could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DC s.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	This is the CFTC s first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Beginning on March 11, 2013, swap dealers, major swap participants and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps; and beginning on June 10, 2013, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	As a result, if UGA enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after June 10, 2013, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the over-the-counter market will be subject to much more extensive CFTC oversight and regulation after the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over-the-counter contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Valuing over-the-counter derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In general, valuing over-the-counter derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such over-the-counter derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating over-the-counter contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding over-the-counter derivatives transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The regulatory requirements for posting margin in uncleared swap transactions is evolving.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and SEC to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization ( i.e., uncleared swaps).
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	On November 6, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by UGA in connection with uncleared swaps.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its unleaded gasoline production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA's Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	The large size of the positions that UGA may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Over-the-counter contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over-the-counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	UGA is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	UGA is not actively managed by conventional methods.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Accordingly, if UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests are declining in value, UGA will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Purchaser upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	USCF will seek to cause the net asset value of UGA s shares to track the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in UGA s shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	UGA s shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of UGA s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The lack of an active trading market for UGA s shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in UGA at the time the investor sells the shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Although UGA s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage UGA and other funds.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	USCF was formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as UGA and has been managing such investment vehicles since April 2006.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. Howard Mah and John Hyland.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	If Messrs. Mah or Hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.60% of net asset value on its average net assets, and over-the-counter spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA's performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on unleaded gasoline prices and unleaded gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA's investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of unleaded gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves UGA susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	UGA is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Purchasers.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P92_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P92_S2	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with UGA have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of UGA and the shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	UGA may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the FCM, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if the investor will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Nonetheless, although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g. , at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P98_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on UGA s net asset value.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The financial markets are currently in a slow period of recovery and the financial markets are still relatively fragile.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Since 2008, the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P102_S2	In addition, the current administration and Congress have periodically been reaching impasses in passing a fiscal budget, which could create long-term concerns regarding the credit of the United States and interest earned, as well as the United States Government s ability to pay its obligations to holders of Treasuries.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P102_S3	If low interest rates on Treasuries continue or if UGA is not able to redeem its investments in Treasuries prior to maturity and the U.S. Government cannot pay its obligations, UGA would be negatively impacted.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P102_S4	In addition, UGA might also be negatively impacted by its use of money market mutual funds to the extent those funds might themselves be using Treasuries.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late 2010 and 2011, economic growth in 2012 was slow and the financial markets are still fragile.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	A poor financial recovery could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of UGA s service providers and Authorized Purchasers, which would impact the ability of USCF to achieve UGA s investment objective.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P105_S2	In that event, the clearing broker s customers, such as UGA, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P105_S3	The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with the clearing broker, although the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	UGA may also be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In addition, to the extent UGA s clearing broker is required to post UGA s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker s customers.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	If UGA s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by UGA and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	From time to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	A clearing broker s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear UGA s trades.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In addition, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	It is possible that third parties might utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_14_ITEM1A_P112_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	UGA may purchase over-the-counter contracts ( OTC Contracts ).
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC Contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an over-the-counter component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These EFR transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the over-the-counter component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFR transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by ISDA that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC Contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC Contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P8_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC Contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P9_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	During the 12 month reporting period ended December 31, 2013, UGA limited its over-the-counter activities to EFR transactions.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_14_ITEM7A_P11_S2	OTC Contracts may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2013, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	The Fund s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P4_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, of the Fund and our report dated March 10, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

1396878_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P22_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P23_S3	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2013, UGA held 486 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.

1396878_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	On December 30, 2013, USCF withdrew the registration statements for USSF, UNGD, USGO and UAC effective December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	On January 27, 2014, USCF withdrew the registration statement for HARD.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	HARD was never available to the public, and at the time of withdrawal, HARD was still in the process of review by various regulatory agencies which have regulatory authority over USCF and HARD.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Effective February 29, 2012, UGA issues shares to certain Authorized Purchasers ( Authorized Purchasers ) by offering baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets ) through ALPS Distributors, Inc., as the marketing agent (the Marketing Agent ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Prior to February 29, 2012, UGA issued shares to Authorized Purchasers by offering baskets consisting of 100,000 shares through the Marketing Agent.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	The purchase price for a Creation Basket is based upon the NAV of a share calculated shortly after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on the day the order to create the basket is properly received.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through May 1, 2014), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Purchasers is $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets ( Redemption Baskets prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Shares may be purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange in smaller increments than a Creation Basket or Redemption Basket.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Shares purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange are not purchased or sold at the per share NAV of UGA but rather at market prices quoted on such exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	In November 2007, UGA initially registered 30,000,000 shares on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

1396878_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Net income (loss) per share is the difference between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.

1396878_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, UGA incurred $ 8,779 , $ 13,751 and $ 26,907 , respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	These costs were approximately $ 200,000 , $ 225,000 and $ 250,000 , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15 % (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2014.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, USCF waived $ 137,776 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P54_S4	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06 % on UGA s assets up to $ 3 billion; and 0.04 % on UGA s assets in excess of $ 3 billion.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The above fee does not include the following expenses, which are also borne by USCF: the cost of placing advertisements in various periodicals; website construction and development; or the printing and production of various marketing materials.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P57_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $ 75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $ 20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.

1396878_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P58_S4	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $ 7 to $ 15 per transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	On October 8, 2013, UGA entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s futures commission merchant ( FCM ), effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	Prior to October 10, 2013, the FCM was UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	The agreements require RBC Capital and UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC Capital and/or UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	In accordance with each agreement, RBC Capital and UBS Securities charge UGA commissions of approximately $ 7 to $ 15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S4	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P59_S5	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $ 39,110 .
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	Of this amount, approximately $ 37,933 , or 96.99 % was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $ 1,177 , or 3.01 % was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2012, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $ 63,245 .
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S4	Of this amount, approximately $ 58,167 , or 91.79 % was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $ 5,078 , or 8.03 % was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S5	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2011, total commissions accrued to brokers amounted to $ 81,427 .
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S6	Of this amount, approximately $ 76,347 , or 93.76 % was a result of rebalancing costs and approximately $ 5,080 , or 6.24 % was the result of trades necessitated by creation and redemption activity.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S7	The decrease in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily a function of a lower number of futures contracts that were held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P60_S8	The decrease in the total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily a function of a lower number of futures contracts that were held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	As an annualized percentage of average daily total net assets, the figure for the year ended December 31, 2013 represents approximately 0.07 % of average daily total net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	By comparison, the figure for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 represented approximately 0.07 % and 0.07 %, respectively, of average daily total net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with a futures commission merchant.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires a futures commission merchant to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the futures commission merchant s proprietary activities.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA were exchange-traded through December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	When UGA enters into non-exchange traded contracts (including Exchange for Risk or EFR transactions), it is subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with a futures commission merchant are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the futures commission merchant s segregation requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	In the event of a futures commission merchant s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	The insolvency of a futures commission merchant could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that futures commission merchant; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of a futures commission merchant.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P72_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per share NAV.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in such money market funds.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, UGA held investments in money market funds in the amounts of $ 38,494,983 and $ 47,494,982 , respectively.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	UGA also holds cash deposits with its custodian.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Pursuant to a written agreement with BBH Co., uninvested overnight cash balances are swept to offshore branches of U.S. regulated and domiciled banks located in Toronto, Canada, London, United Kingdom, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and Nassau, Bahamas, which are subject to U.S. regulation and regulatory oversight.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries in the amounts of $ 15,751,658 and $ 14,075,770 , respectively, with the custodian and futures commission merchant.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian and/or futures commission merchant cease operations.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following table presents per share performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	An individual shareholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2013 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2012 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-11 require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	UGA has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
1396878_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	This evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.
1396878_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	UGA maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in UGA s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

1396878_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	UGA s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to USCF and the Board of USCF regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1396878_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

1396878_14_ITEM10_P30_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF, including investing in the futures contracts and other commodity interests in order to track the benchmark futures contracts of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P30_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading the discussion and execution of new strategic objectives.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P31_S0	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P31_S1	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P31_S2	The Board believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer facilitates information flow between USCF and the Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as over-the-counter swap contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P32_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P33_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P34_S0	The Board also determines compensation payable to employees of USCF, including the portfolio managers of each of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P34_S1	The compensation of certain employees of USCF is, in part, based on the amount of assets under management by UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P34_S2	The Board feels that compensating certain employees, in part, based on the amount of assets under management is appropriate since having more assets in a fund generally reflects that investors perceive the fund s investment objective is being met.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in over-the-counter swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including over-the-counter swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any over-the-counter swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P35_S5	In making compensation decisions, the Board considers whether a compensation arrangement would expose UGA or the Related Public Funds to additional risks and whether the risks posed by such arrangement are consistent with the best interests of UGA s investors.
1396878_14_ITEM10_P36_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P0_S0	UGA does not directly compensate any of the executive officers noted above.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P0_S3	UGA pays fees to USCF pursuant to the LP Agreement under which it is obligated to pay USCF an annualized fee of 0.60% of its average daily net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P0_S4	For 2013, UGA accrued aggregate management fees of $351,177.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following table sets forth compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2013, by the directors of USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P1_S1	UGA s portion of the aggregate fees paid to the directors for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $7,044.
1396878_14_ITEM11_P2_S0	Mr. Fobes serves as chairman of the audit committee of USCF and receives additional compensation in recognition of the additional responsibilities he has undertaken in this role.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P0_S0	UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P0_S1	However, there have been no direct financial transactions between UGA and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P1_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction with a related person that must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K item 404(a), including financial transactions by UGA with directors or executive officers of USCF or holders of beneficial interests in USCF or UGA of more than 5%, will be subject to the provisions regarding Resolutions of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care as set forth in Section 7.7 of the LP Agreement and will be reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the Board of USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2014, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_14_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_14_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
1396878_14_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for (i) the audit of UGA s annual financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and certain of UGA s current reports on Form 8-K; (ii) the audit of UGA s internal control over financial reporting included in the annual report on Form 10-K; and (iii) services that are normally provided by the Independent Registered Public Accountants in connection with statutory and regulatory filings of registration statements.
1396878_14_ITEM14_P2_S0	Tax fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and partnership income tax return filings.
1396878_14_ITEM14_P3_S0	The audit committee has established policies and procedures which are intended to control the services provided by UGA s independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence.
1396878_14_ITEM14_P3_S1	Under these policies and procedures, no audit or permitted non-audit services (including fees and terms thereof), except for the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, may be undertaken by UGA s independent auditors unless the engagement is specifically pre-approved by the audit committee.
1396878_14_ITEM14_P4_S0	The audit committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals must be presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P0_S0	See Index to Financial Statements on page 59.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P1_S0	No financial statement schedules are filed herewith because (i) such schedules are not required or (ii) the information required has been presented in the aforementioned financial statements.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P2_S0	Exhibits required to be filed by Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	Ethics are important to United States Commodity Funds LLC (the Company or USCF ) and to each member of our management, our investment professionals, and our employees.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	The Company is committed to the highest ethical standards and to conducting business with the highest level of integrity.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P6_S2	The following sets forth the Ninth Amended Code of Conduct and Ethics policy of the Company, adopted on March 1, 2006, last amended on February 20, 2014.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	All officers, directors and employees of the Company are responsible for maintaining this level of integrity and for complying with the policies contained in this Code.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	If you have a question or concern about what is proper conduct for you or anyone else, please raise these concerns with any member of management, or follow the procedures outlined this Code.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	reaffirm and promote our commitment to a corporate culture that values honesty and accountability.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	All employees, as a condition of employment or continued employment, will acknowledge in writing that they have received a copy of this Code, read it, and understand that the Code contains our expectations regarding their conduct.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	Finally, you should know that this Code is designed to satisfy the standards contained in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	U.S. federal courts are bound to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations when sentencing companies convicted of federal offenses arising from the illegal acts of one or more employees.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations provide for substantial leniency in sentencing of a company from otherwise severe mandatory penalties, where the company had in effect an adequate compliance program at the time of the illegal activity.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P11_S1	A conflict exists when your personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P11_S2	For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:
1396878_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another s personal benefit.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when the opportunity to do so presents itself.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	compete, or prepare to compete, with us.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	We are committed to a policy of full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure to shareholders of all material information regarding our business.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P15_S1	This policy extends to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and to all other public communications.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P15_S2	All individuals involved in our SEC reporting process and in preparing and making public communications regarding our business must take all reasonable steps to comply with this policy.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	You must not disclose confidential information regarding the Company, our service providers, the Index Funds Trust, the Funds or our affiliates, unless disclosure is authorized or required by law.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P16_S1	Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be harmful to, or useful to the competitors of, the Company, the Index Funds Trust, any Fund, our affiliates, our service providers, or our other business partners.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	You must endeavor to deal fairly with companies or individuals with whom we do business or come into contact, including fellow employees of the Company and our competitors.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	You must not take unfair advantage of these or other parties by means of:
1396878_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	Our assets are to be used only for legitimate business purposes.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	You should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	You must not trade the shares of any Fund, or the securities of our affiliates, our service providers, or any of our other business partners while in the possession of inside information.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	You must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	You must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	You may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	Please talk to any member of management if you have any questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex or gender, religion, age, national origin, handicap, disability, citizenship status, or any other status protected by law.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or marital status.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	This includes such data as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	No false or artificial entries may be made.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	If you believe that this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, please contact our Chief Compliance Officer (the Chief Compliance Officer ).
1396878_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	No funds of the Company or of any Funds may be given directly to political candidates.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	You may, however, engage in political activity with your own resources on your own time.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	We must speak with a unified voice in all dealings with the press and other media.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P31_S2	Any requests from the media must be referred to him.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P31_S3	Unless another individual(s) is so authorized by the President and CEO.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P31_S4	In the event the President and CEO and other authorized individual(s) are not available, clearance must be obtained through the Chief Compliance Officer.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	USCF, the Funds and the Index Funds Trust produce limited promotional material, which includes websites and a fact-sheet for each of the Funds.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	In addition to procedures intended to safeguard against a Fund fact-sheet being misleading or deceptive, it is a USCF policy that Fund fact-sheets may only be distributed to the public when accompanied by the current applicable Fund prospectus.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	As noted above, all content to be included on a Fund website is reviewed and approved by USCF s counsel prior to publication of such content on such website.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	A review of website information is performed each time new information placed on the website would lead to a substantively new version of the web page.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	The review and approval of website material is documented by the supervisor in charge of such review.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	USCF does not allow the use of personal websites by its employees or agents for the solicitation of business to any of the Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	USCF, or its service providers, maintains the supporting documentation for all statements, claims and performance results referenced in promotional material prepared by or on behalf of the Funds.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Information generated in our business is a valuable asset.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	Employees who have access to our intellectual property information are obligated to safeguard it from unauthorized access and must:

1396878_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	We may provide an e-mail system and Internet access to certain of our employees to help them do their work.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	This type of review is performed in conformity with NFA and FINRA guidance on e-mail review, in consideration of the fact that USCF generally communicates with institutional or relatively sophisticated clients, while USCF s marketing agent handles most communication with the general public.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	Normally, reports should be made to one s immediate supervisor.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	Under some circumstances, it may be impractical or you may feel uncomfortable raising a matter with your supervisor.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P41_S4	In those instances, you are encouraged to contact our Chief Compliance Officer or General Counsel who will investigate and report the matter to the Board of Directors, as the circumstance dictates.
1396878_14_ITEM15_P41_S5	You will also be expected to cooperate in an investigation of a violation.

1396878_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	All reports will be investigated and whenever possible, requests for confidentiality shall be honored.

1396878_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per share NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $2.7617 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Prices hit a peak on February 19, 2013 of $3.3152 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	The low for the year was on November 7, 2013, when the prices dropped to $2.5031 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.7859 per gallon, up approximately 0.88% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	UGA s per share NAV began the year at $58.39 and ended the year at $59.89 on December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately 2.57% over the year.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	UGA s per share NAV reached its high for the year on February 14, 2013 at $65.48 and reached its low for the year on November 7, 2013 at $53.74.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2013 contract and ended with the February 2014 contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase of approximately 0.88% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the gasoline futures market exhibited periods of both contango and backwardation, with the market in backwardation the majority of the time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The per share NAV of UGA s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 300,000 shares to the initial Authorized Purchaser, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s shares no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2013, UGA had issued 9,100,000 shares, 950,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2013, there were 70,900,000 shares registered but not yet issued.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	More shares may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2013, UGA had the following Authorized Purchasers: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., NewEdge USA LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets Corporation, SG Americas Securities LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets.

1396878_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	UGA held 96.21% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds at the Custodian, while 3.79% of the cash balance was held as investments in Treasuries and margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased at the FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The ending per share NAV on December 31, 2013 was $59.89.

1396878_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	UGA held 91.60% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in money market funds at the Custodian, while 8.40% of the cash balance was held as investments in Treasuries and margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased at the FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The decrease in cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds for December 31, 2013, as compared to December 31, 2012, was the result of UGA s smaller size during the year ended December 31, 2013 as measured by total net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	The ending per share NAV on December 31, 2012 was $58.39.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	The increase in the per share NAV for December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012 was primarily due to the decrease in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts between the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	By comparison, as of December 31, 2011, the total unrealized gain on gasoline Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $4,729,725 and UGA established cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds that were equal to $72,599,046.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	UGA held 93.85% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in money market funds at the Custodian, while 6.15% of the cash balance was held as investments in Treasuries and margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased at the FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The decrease in cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds for December 31, 2012 as compared to December 31, 2011, was the result of UGA s smaller size during the year ended December 31, 2012 as measured by total net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	The ending per share NAV on December 31, 2011 was $48.37.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	The increase in the per share NAV for December 31, 2012, as compared to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the impact of backwardation and the increase in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract between the year ended December 31, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	UGA pays USCF a management fee of 0.60% of its average net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the average daily total net assets of UGA were $58,529,442.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The management fee incurred by UGA during the year amounted to $351,177.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the average daily total net assets of UGA were $91,674,247.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	The management fee paid by UGA during the year amounted to $550,046.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2011, the average daily total net assets of UGA were $112,658,149.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	The management fee paid by UGA during the year amounted to $675,949.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	In addition to the management fee, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses, including tax reporting costs, licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, ongoing registration or other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The gross total of these fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $333,136, as compared to $392,438 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $371,963 for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1396878_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that average daily changes in its per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the average daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2013, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.172%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.167%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The average daily difference was (0.004)% (or (0.4) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (1.604)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2013, the last trading day in December.

1396878_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Since the commencement of the offering of UGA shares to the public on February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2013, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.042%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.039%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.977)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 2.57%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $58.39 on December 31, 2012 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2013 of $58.39.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $60.46 as of December 31, 2013, for a total return over the relevant time period of 3.54%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 2.57% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 3.54% was an error over the time period of (0.97)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $14,479, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.02% for such period.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA also collected $5,600 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA incurred net expenses of $546,537.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(526,458) which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.90)% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2012, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 20.72%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $48.37 on December 31, 2011 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2012 of $58.39.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $58.89 as of December 31, 2012, for a total return over the relevant time period of 21.75%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 20.72% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 21.75% was an error over the time period of (1.03)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $26,007, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.03% for such period.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA also collected $12,250 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA incurred net expenses of $803,038.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P41_S10	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(764,781), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.83)% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 15.00%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $42.06 on December 31, 2010 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2011 of $48.37.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $48.76 as of December 31, 2011, for a total return over the relevant time period of 15.93%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 15.00% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 15.93% was an error over the time period of (0.93)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $19,169, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.02% for such period.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA also collected $26,200 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S8	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2011, UGA incurred net expenses of $943,859.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P42_S10	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(898,490), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.80)% for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Second, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA earned, on an annualized basis, approximately 0.02% on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	It also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of (0.60)% for management fees, approximately (0.07)% in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts, and approximately (0.27)% for other net expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The foregoing fees and expenses resulted in a net yield on an annualized basis of approximately (0.90)% and affected UGA s ability to track its benchmark.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Using the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 8%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P54_S6	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Using again the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	In this example, it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P55_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years for gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P56_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Investors will further note that the markets display a very seasonal pattern that corresponds to the seasonal demand patterns for gasoline mentioned above.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	That is, in many, but not all cases, the price of the near month is higher than the next month during the middle of the summer months as the price of gasoline for delivery in those summer months rises to meet peak demand.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	At the same time, the price of the near month contract, when that month is just before the onset of spring, does not rise as far or as fast as the price of a next month contract whose delivery falls closer to the start of the summer season.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	For example, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2012 and held to December 31, 2013 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 2.57%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 0.88% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2011 and held to December 31, 2012 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 20.72%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 3.92% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was impacted by several factors.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	In particular, USCF believes that rising crude oil prices in the United States were partially offset by resolution of refinery maintenance issues towards the end of September 2013, resulting in gasoline prices that concluded the year up only a moderate amount.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2013 at $2.7617 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Prices rose sharply over the course of the year and hit a peak on February 19, 2013 of $3.3152 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	The low for the year was on November 7, 2013, when the price dropped to $2.5031 per gallon.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $2.7859 per gallon, up approximately 0.88% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	On the consumption side, demand growth remained moderate inside and outside the United States as global economic growth, including emerging economies such as China and India, showed signs of slowing economic growth.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	Europe in particular showed signs of weakness as the ongoing financial and banking crisis raised concerns during the first quarter of 2013.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	On the supply side, efforts to reduce production in recent years by OPEC to more closely match global consumption were partially successful.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	However, continuing concerns about the political standoff with Iran have left the market subject to bouts of heightened volatility as OPEC s ability to replace Iranian oil currently subject to embargo is not unlimited.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	In addition, security issues in Libya, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria also contributed to heightened volatility.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	In recent years, oil production in the United States and Canada has increased.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, limits on oil transportation infrastructure, including pipelines, have made it more difficult for the increased production to move to the centers of refining, often leading to a build-up in crude oil inventory in areas of the United States, such as the U.S. Midwest, and Canada.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	The result is that crude oil prices in the U.S. Midwest, where the pricing point of the light, sweet crude oil contract is located, have tended to trade at a lower price than crude oil in other parts of the United States and lower than global crude oil benchmarks such as Brent crude oil.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	United States crude oil prices finished the year ended December 31, 2013 approximately 2.79% higher than at the beginning of the year, as the global economy continues to adjust to periods of slow recovery and economic growth.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	USCF believes that should the global economic situation cease to improve, or decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels, while any military actions involving Iran would likely have the opposite effect.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	For the ten year time period between 2003 and 2013, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of unleaded gasoline on a monthly basis was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated with the movements of natural gas, large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds or global equities.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, movements in unleaded gasoline were strongly correlated to movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Over the shorter one-year period ended December 31, 2013, unleaded gasoline was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated with large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds, global equities, and natural gas.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Unleaded gasoline remained strongly correlated with crude oil and diesel-heating oil over the shorter period.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with daily changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its over-the-counter contracts and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at the Custodian and in investments in Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, UGA used other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a decrease in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P77_S8	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P78_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	Since the initial offering of shares, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P80_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	An FCM, when acting on behalf of UGA in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases over-the-counter contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2013, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $54,246,641 with the Custodian and FCM.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should the Custodian and/or FCM cease operations.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2013, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	UGA had no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of December 31, 2013 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares as of February 29, 2012 called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of the Custodian and Transfer Agent, BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2014.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P93_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to a FCM), over-the-counter dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Commission payments to a FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	As of December 31, 2013, UGA s portfolio consisted of 486 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2013, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_14_ITEM12_P0_S0	None of the directors or executive officers of USCF, nor the employees of UGA own any shares of UGA.
1396878_14_ITEM12_P0_S1	In addition, UGA is not aware of any 5% holder of its shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) is a Delaware limited partnership organized on April 13, 2007.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	UGA maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests ( shares ) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	UGA s shares began trading on February 26, 2008.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	USCF is the general partner of UGA and is responsible for the management of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	USCF is a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on May 10, 2005.

1396878_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	On January 30, 2015, USCF as the sponsor of United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the Trust ) and its series USMI announced that its officers and members had authorized a plan to (i) liquidate USMI, (ii) terminate the continuous offering of USMI, and (iii) deregister USMI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and therefore, terminate the Trust s obligation to include USMI on its periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	USCF has submitted written notice to the NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca ) of its decision to liquidate USMI, terminate the offering and to terminate USMI s obligations under the Exchange Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	USCF intends to file a post-effective amendment on behalf of the Trust and USMI to terminate the offering of the registered and unsold shares of USMI.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	The NYSE Arca will file a Form 25 with the SEC to affect the withdrawal of the listing of USMI from the NYSE Arca.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	Delisting from the NYSE Arca will become effective 10 days after the filing date of the Form 25.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Provided that USMI continues to meet the applicable legal requirements, USCF intends to file a Form 15 on behalf of the Trust and USMI with the SEC in early April 2015 to suspend the Trust s duty to include USMI on its reports under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	USMI expects the termination of registration will become effective 90 days after the date of the filing of the Form 15 with the SEC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	All funds listed previously are referred to collectively herein as the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Related Public Funds are subject to reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	For more information about each of the Related Public Funds, investors in UGA may call 1.800.920.0259 or visit www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com or the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC ) website at www.sec.gov.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	USCF is required to evaluate the credit risk of UGA to the futures commission merchant ( FCM ), oversee the purchase and sale of UGA s shares by certain authorized purchasers ( Authorized Participants ), review daily positions and margin requirements of UGA and manage UGA s investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	USCF also pays the fees of ALPS Distributors, Inc., which serves as the marketing agent for UGA (the Marketing Agent ), and Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ), which serves as the administrator (the Administrator ) and the custodian (the Custodian ) for UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Limited partners have no right to elect USCF as the general partner on an annual or any other continuing basis.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	If USCF voluntarily withdraws as general partner, however, the holders of a majority of UGA s outstanding shares (excluding for purposes of such determination shares owned, if any, by the withdrawing USCF and its affiliates) may elect its successor.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UGA s outstanding shares (excluding shares owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of three management directors (the Management Directors ), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USCF, dated as of July 22, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the LLC Agreement ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	The Board has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes III and Peter M. Robinson).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	For additional information relating to the audit committee, please see Item 10 .
1396878_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Audit Committee in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded ( over-the-counter ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of gasoline, in percentage terms.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The shares issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Creation Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P27_S5	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	While UGA issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares traded on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, on a percentage basis.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of B , where:
1396878_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s share price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in UGA s per share NAV.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UGA s per share NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract, will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in Futures Contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the OTC market ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P35_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UGA s ability to invest in over-the-counter transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as over-the-counter contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	The heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a Diesel-Heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	The Diesel-Heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	In addition, most U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S. based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	As of December 31, 2014, UGA held 658 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2014, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: over-the-counter, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Furthermore, until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S5	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P59_S6	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a ten percent (10%) or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	See The Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	While the gasoline Futures Contracts can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as over-the-counter contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over-the-counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an over-the-counter component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Risk or EFR transaction).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	These EFR transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the over-the-counter component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFR transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts and EFR transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.

1396878_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	UGA also employs ALPS Distributors, Inc. as its marketing agent (the Marketing Agent or ALPS Distributors ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	ALPS Distributors principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	On October 8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM, effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Prior to October 10, 2013, UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ) was UGA s FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to UGA, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P86_S3	For the period October 10, 2013 and after, UGA pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P86_S4	Prior to October 10, 2013, UGA paid UBS Securities commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	RBC Capital s primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	From UGA s commencement of trading to October 10, 2013, UBS Securities was a futures clearing broker for UGA .
1396878_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Effective October 10, 2013, RBC Capital became the futures clearing broker for UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	Both RBC Capital and UBS Securities are registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as a FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	RBC Capital and UBS Securities are members of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	RBC is a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	As a result, certain of RBC s regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect to issues raised in various investigations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P89_S3	In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P89_S4	RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	RBC has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	RBC is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC s business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	RBC contests liability and/or the amount of damages, as appropriate, in each pending matter.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.

1396878_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	UGA shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P121_S4	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $567,863 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P121_S5	UGA s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $12,396.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P122_S1	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P122_S2	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry (the Register ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P122_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P122_S4	The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P123_S1	Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P123_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P124_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P124_S2	Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated by:
1396878_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S4	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S5	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P129_S6	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P130_S2	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P130_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S1	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S2	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S3	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S4	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S5	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S6	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S7	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P131_S8	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA shares on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P133_S2	If the market price of UGA shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P133_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P133_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P135_S1	Authorized Participants must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P135_S2	To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P135_S3	The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P135_S4	The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2014 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2015), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P136_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P136_S2	As of December 31, 2014, 13 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P136_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA issued 12 Creation Baskets and redeemed 7 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P137_S1	In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P137_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P138_S2	Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and UGA under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P141_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P141_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P143_S2	Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P144_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant s purchase of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P146_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P148_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P148_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P149_S1	UGA s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P153_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P153_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P153_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P154_S1	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P154_S2	An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other over-the-counter energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P155_S3	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant s sale of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P156_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P157_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P157_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P157_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P158_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P158_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P159_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P159_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P159_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P160_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P160_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2015), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P160_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P160_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P161_S0	Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P162_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P162_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S1	Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S2	An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S3	Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S4	The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between UGA s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P163_S5	Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P164_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P164_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P165_S0	Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P165_S1	Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P165_S2	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P165_S3	While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P165_S4	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P166_S0	USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P166_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P167_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P167_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P168_S0	Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P168_S1	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P168_S2	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_15_ITEM1_P169_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P170_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P170_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P171_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P171_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P171_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P172_S0	A FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P172_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P173_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P174_S0	If UGA enters into a swap agreement, UGA must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P174_S1	The amount of collateral UGA posts changes according to the amounts owed by UGA to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by UGA at the start of a swap transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P174_S2	Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P175_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P175_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (retail, eligible contract participant, or eligible commercial entity), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P176_S0	The offer and sale of shares of UGA, as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P177_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P177_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P178_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P178_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P178_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P179_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P179_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P179_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P180_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P180_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P180_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P181_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P182_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P182_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P182_S2	At a minimum, over-the-counter currency forwards, options and swaps will be subject to heightened recordkeeping, reporting and business conduct standards.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P183_S0	Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P183_S1	The final determination does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P184_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P184_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P184_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P185_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P185_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P185_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P186_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P186_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P186_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P187_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P187_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P188_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P188_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P189_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P189_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P189_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P189_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P190_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P190_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P190_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P190_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P190_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P191_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P192_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P192_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over-the-counter market.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P192_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P193_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P193_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P194_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P194_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P194_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P195_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P195_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P196_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P196_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, and then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P196_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P196_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P197_S0	Regulations require that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations ( derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P198_S0	As of June 10, 2013, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P198_S1	As a result, if UGA enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P198_S2	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P199_S0	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organizations, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P199_S1	Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P200_S0	On April 9, 2013, the CFTC s Division of Market Oversight issued a letter granting time-limited no-action relief to non-swap dealer, non-major swap participant counterparties from the real-time, regular and historical swap reporting requirements (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC s regulations, respectively).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P201_S0	The regular reporting requirements (Part 45 of the CFTC regulations) for interest rate and credit swaps of a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as UGA) began on April 10, 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P201_S1	For a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as UGA), regular reporting requirements for equity, foreign exchange and other commodity swaps (including swaps on gasoline) began on May 29, 2013 and reporting of all historical swaps for all asset classes began on September 30, 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P202_S0	Regulation imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P202_S1	In other words, the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by UGA in connection with uncleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P203_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P203_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P204_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P204_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P204_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P205_S0	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P206_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P206_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P206_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P207_S0	The CEA also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P208_S0	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P208_S1	Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P209_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P209_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P209_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P210_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P210_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P210_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P211_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P212_S0	The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P213_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P213_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P213_S2	The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P214_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P214_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P214_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P215_S0	Regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P215_S1	The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P216_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P216_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P217_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or a FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO and their respective associated persons.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P218_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P218_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P219_S0	The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P219_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P219_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts traded on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S3	Furthermore, until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S4	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S5	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P220_S6	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P221_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a ten percent (10%) or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P221_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P221_S2	By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P222_S0	Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of UGA to achieve its investment objective.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P223_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P223_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P224_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P224_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P225_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P225_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P225_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P225_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P226_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P226_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P226_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S0	Regulators have not yet finalized the Dodd-Frank Act rules regarding initial margin levels for over-the-counter derivatives.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S1	It is possible that such levels may be higher than those for futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S2	Also, initial margin requirements for non-cleared swaps will be subject to higher margin requirements than cleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S3	And, under pending rule proposals, UGA may be required to post, but not be entitled to receive, initial and variation margin in respect of non-cleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S4	Until such time as the regulators finalize these margin rules, trading in the over-the-counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally will not require margin per se.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S5	Rather, it will involve the extension of credit between counterparties that is secured by transfers of credit support and/or independent amounts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P227_S6	Credit support is transferred between counterparties in respect of the open over-the-counter derivatives entered into between them, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the execution of a particular over-the-counter transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P228_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P228_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P228_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P229_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P230_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P230_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P230_S2	If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader s position.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P230_S3	With respect to UGA s trading, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P231_S0	Regulations impose requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P231_S1	In other words, the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by UGA in connection with uncleared swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P232_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S0	On August 12, 2013, the CFTC issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators ( CPOs ) of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ) that are required to register due to recent changes to CFTC Regulation 4.5.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S1	The final rules were issued in a CFTC release entitled Harmonization of Compliance Obligations for Registered Investment Companies Required to Register as Commodity Pool Operators.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S2	For entities that are registered with both the CFTC and the SEC, the CFTC will accept the SEC s disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping regime as substituted compliance for substantially all of Part 4 of the CFTC s regulations, so long as they comply with comparable requirements under the SEC s statutory and regulatory compliance regime.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S3	Thus, the final rules (the Harmonization Rules ) allow dually registered entities to meet certain CFTC regulatory requirements for CPOs by complying with SEC rules to which they are already subject.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S4	Although UGA is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Harmonization Rules amended certain CFTC disclosure rules to make the requirements for all CPOs to periodically update their disclosure documents consistent with those of the SEC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S5	This change will decrease the burden to UGA and USCF of having to comply with inconsistent regulatory requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P233_S6	It is not known whether the CFTC will make additional amendments to its disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules to further harmonize these obligations with those of the SEC as they apply to UGA and USCF, but any such further rule changes could result in additional operating efficiencies for UGA and USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P234_S0	On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted final rules governing the structure and operation of money market funds, in a release adopting amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P234_S1	The new rules will require institutional prime money market funds to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a floating NAV ).
1396878_15_ITEM1_P234_S2	In addition, all money market funds will be able, and in certain cases will be required, to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend redemptions during periods of market stress, subject to certain board findings.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P234_S3	Finally, the SEC also revised certain diversification provisions of Rule 2a-7, as well as provisions relating to stress testing.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P235_S0	UGA currently invests in money market funds, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P235_S1	It is unclear at this time what impact of money market reform would have on UGA s ability to hedge risk, however, the imposition of a floating NAV could cause UGA to limit remaining assets solely in Treasuries and cash.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P236_S0	With regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P237_S0	UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P237_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P238_S0	UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.

1396878_15_ITEM1_P239_S4	USCF relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P239_S5	So long as USCF continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations, it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P240_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS (U.S. Reg.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P240_S1	No. 3600670) for fund investment services, in use since June 24, 2008, USCF (U.S. Reg.

1396878_15_ITEM1_P240_S4	USCF relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P240_S5	So long as USCF continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations; it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P241_S0	USCF has been granted two patents Nos.
1396878_15_ITEM1_P241_S1	7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily percentage change in the net asset value ( NAV ) per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of unleaded gasoline, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	UGA s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in unleaded gasoline and to hedge against movements in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	An investment in UGA involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in UGA involves tax risks, over-the-counter risks, and other risks.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The net asset value of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by UGA and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The NAV of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of unleaded gasoline in the marketplace.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for unleaded gasoline correlates closely with general economic growth rates.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on unleaded gasoline prices.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Other factors that may affect the demand for unleaded gasoline and therefore its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for unleaded gasoline associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce unleaded gasoline prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The supply of and demand for unleaded gasoline may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Investing in UGA s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks:
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than net asset value.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	UGA s NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of UGA s portfolio investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the unleaded gasoline and the Benchmark Futures Contract at any point in time.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The NAV of UGA s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet, light unleaded gasoline trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global gasoline market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Daily percentage changes in UGA s net asset value may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in UGA s NAV per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for unleaded gasoline, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As UGA approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, UGA may begin investing in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, UGA is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract because the total return generated by UGA is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with UGA s trading activities, and increased by interest income from UGA s holdings of Treasury securities.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract requires trading of UGA s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract and the spot price of unleaded gasoline may at times be only approximate.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Futures Contract) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and technical influences in oil futures trading.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Natural forces in the oil futures market known as backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In the event of an unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Conversely, in the event of a unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of unleaded gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of UGA s per share NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Specifically, the Position Limit Rules, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located trading platforms.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products ( e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products ( e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investment subject to these limits.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a ten percent (10%) or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect UGA, but it may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in unleaded gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed unleaded gasoline futures.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Currently, over-the-counter transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade over-the-counter Gasoline Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Over-the-counter contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The markets for over-the-counter contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	While certain regulations adopted over the past two years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over-the-counter market, the current regulation of the over-the-counter contracts could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	As a result of such regulations, if UGA enters into certain interest rate and credit default swaps, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the over-the-counter market will be subject to much more extensive regulatory oversight.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over-the-counter contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Valuing over-the-counter derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In general, valuing over-the-counter derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such over-the-counter derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating over-the-counter contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding over-the-counter derivatives transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its unleaded gasoline production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA's Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The large size of the positions that UGA may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Over-the-counter contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over-the-counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	UGA is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	UGA is not actively managed by conventional methods.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Accordingly, if UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests are declining in value, UGA will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	USCF will seek to cause the NAV of UGA s shares to track the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in UGA s shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	UGA s shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of UGA s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The lack of an active trading market for UGA s shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in UGA at the time the investor sells the shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Although UGA s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage UGA and other funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	USCF was formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as UGA and has been managing such investment vehicles since April 2006.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Since April 2006, the Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer have been managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Since January 2015, Mr. Gerber has assumed a more active role in the day-to-day activities of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The Chief Investment Officer has resigned effective May 1, 2015.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Mr. Gerber has stated that it is his intent to not replace the Chief Investment Officer s position, but to utilize current and future staff to fill any material gaps that may ensue from the Chief Investment Officer s departure.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P65_S4	There is a risk that not replacing the Chief Investment Officer may have a material adverse effect on the management and/or financial results of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USCF (the LLC Agreement ) provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF s parent company, which is a closely-held private company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by one person.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	USCF s Board of Directors currently consists of three Management Directors, each of whom are shareholders of USCF s parent, Wainwright Holdings, Inc.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	( Wainwright ), and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Under USCF s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company s Board of Directors.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In addition, any Director may be removed by written consent of Wainwright, which is the sole member of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Wainwright is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are held by or on behalf of Nicholas D. Gerber and his immediate family members (the Gerber Family ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Historically, shares of Wainwright have been voted by, and on behalf of, the Gerber Family by Nicholas D. Gerber, and it is anticipated that such trend will continue in the future.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and UGA, including their regulatory obligations.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, and over-the-counter spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA's performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on unleaded gasoline prices and unleaded gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA's investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of unleaded gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves UGA susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P86_S3	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	UGA is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with UGA have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of UGA and the shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	UGA may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the FCM, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P92_S3	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P94_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P94_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if the investor will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Nonetheless, although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g. , at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P96_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on UGA s net asset value.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted final rules governing the structure and operation of money market funds, in a release adopting amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The new rules will require institutional prime money market funds to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a floating NAV ).
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	In addition, all money market funds will be able, and in certain cases will be required, to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend redemptions during periods of market stress, subject to certain board findings.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Finally, the SEC also revised certain diversification provisions of Rule 2a-7, as well as provisions relating to stress testing.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	UGA currently invests in money market funds, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	It is unclear at this time what impact of money market reform would have on UGA s ability to hedge risk, however, the imposition of a floating NAV could cause UGA to limit remaining assets solely in Treasuries and cash.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	In that event, the clearing broker s customers, such as UGA, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P102_S3	The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with the clearing broker, although the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	UGA may also be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In addition, to the extent UGA s clearing broker is required to post UGA s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker s customers.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	If UGA s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by UGA and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	From time to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	A clearing broker s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear UGA s trades.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In addition, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	It is possible that third parties might utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_15_ITEM1A_P109_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	UGA may purchase over-the-counter contracts ( OTC Contracts ).
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC Contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an over-the-counter component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These EFR transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the over-the-counter component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFR transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by ISDA that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC Contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC Contracts with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC Contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its over-the-counter activities to EFR transactions.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_15_ITEM7A_P10_S2	OTC Contracts may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2014, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	* Collateral amounted to $6,161,581 on open futures contracts.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P14_S3	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2014, UGA held 658 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are reflected in the statements of financial condition and represent the difference between the original contract amount and the market value (as determined by exchange settlement prices for futures contracts and related options and cash dealer prices at a predetermined time for forward contracts, physical commodities, and their related options) as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), UGA is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any tax related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in UGA recording a tax liability that reduces net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	However, UGA s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Profit or loss shall be allocated among the partners of UGA in proportion to the number of shares each partner holds as of the close of each month.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	USCF may revise, alter or otherwise modify this method of allocation as described in the LP Agreement.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Net income (loss) per share is the difference between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	The weighted average number of shares outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average share.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	The weighted average shares are equal to the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for shares added and redeemed based on the amount of time the shares were outstanding during such period.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	There were no shares held by USCF at December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Offering costs incurred in connection with the registration of additional shares after the initial registration of shares are borne by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	These costs include registration fees paid to regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offerings.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	These costs are accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter period if warranted.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Cash equivalents include money market funds and overnight deposits or time deposits with original maturity dates of six months or less.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Certain amounts in the accompanying financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires USCF to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Under the LP Agreement, USCF is responsible for investing the assets of UGA in accordance with the objectives and policies of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	In addition, USCF has arranged for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custody, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	For these services, UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a fee, which is paid monthly, equal to 0.60% per annum of average daily total net assets.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	These costs include registration or other fees paid to regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offer and sale.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, UGA incurred $46,454, $46,453 and $20,911, respectively, in registration fees and other offering expenses.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, UGA incurred $7,357, $8,779 and $13,751, respectively, under this arrangement.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	These costs were approximately $164,000, $225,000 and $225,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2015.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014, USCF waived $182,226 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P48_S4	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 Contracts and Agreements below.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution related services exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of UGA s offering.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The above fee does not include website construction and development, which are also borne by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P51_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of the Related Public Funds combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for the Related Public Funds combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once the Related Public Funds combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P52_S4	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	On October 8, 2013, UGA entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s futures commission merchant ( FCM ), effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	Prior to October 10, 2013, the FCM was UBS Securities LLC ( UBS Securities ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	The agreements require RBC Capital and UBS Securities to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC Capital and/or UBS Securities for UGA s account.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	In accordance with each agreement, RBC Capital and UBS Securities charge UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S4	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P53_S5	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers for December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, were similar; and were also similar for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to December 31, 2012, as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Total commissions as an annualized percentage of average total net assets for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was similar; and was similar for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to December 31, 2012, as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG and USMI, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Cleared swaps are over-the-counter agreements that are eligible to be cleared by a clearinghouse, but are not traded on an exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	A cleared swap is created when the parties to an off-exchange over-the-counter swap transaction agree to extinguish their OTC contract and replace with a cleared swap.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	Cleared swaps are intended to provide the efficiencies and benefits that centralized clearing or an exchange offers to traders of futures contracts, including credit risk intermediation and the ability to offset positions initiated with different counterparties.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with a FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires a FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Buying and selling options on futures contracts exposes investors to the risks of purchasing or selling futures contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA were exchange-traded through December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	When UGA enters into non-exchange traded contracts (including Exchange for Risk or EFR transactions), it is subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with a FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the FCM s segregation requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	In the event of a FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P69_S3	The insolvency of a FCM could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that FCM; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of a FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P69_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following table presents per share performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2014 using the fair value hierarchy:

1396878_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-11 require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	Level I - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P146_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P146_S2	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P146_S3	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

1396878_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

1396878_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Funds engage in the trading of U.S. futures contracts, options on U.S. contracts, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter derivative transactions (collectively derivatives ).
1396878_15_ITEM8_P186_S1	The Funds are exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts; and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Funds, with the exception of USNG, are exchange-traded.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions since, in over-the-counter transactions, the Funds must rely solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S2	To the extent the Funds enter into non-exchange traded contracts, they are subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S4	The Funds also have credit risk since the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P187_S5	In addition, the Funds bear the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	The purchase and sale of futures and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with an FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	A customer s cash and other property, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM s segregation requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P190_S1	In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P190_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	Theoretically, the Funds are exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P191_S2	As both buyers and sellers of options, the Funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P192_S1	In addition, the Company has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counter-party with which it conducts business.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	The financial instruments held by the Company are reported in the statement of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturities.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company has securities for its own account and may incur losses if the market value of the securities decreases subsequent to December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P195_S1	Assets deposited with banks are subject to credit risk.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P195_S2	In the event of a bank's insolvency, recovery of the Company's assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.
1396878_15_ITEM8_P195_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had cash of $870,123 in excess of the federally insured amount of $250,000.

1396878_15_ITEM10_P21_S1	These individuals are Principals due to their positions, however, Nicholas Gerber and Melinda Gerber are also Principals due to their controlling stake in Wainwright.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P21_S2	None of the Principals owns or has any other beneficial interest in UGA.

1396878_15_ITEM10_P23_S0	The Board of USCF has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes III, and Peter M. Robinson).
1396878_15_ITEM10_P23_S1	Mr. Forbes currently serves as chair of the Audit Committee.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P23_S2	The audit committee is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P23_S3	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the audit committee charter, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P24_S0	The Board has determined that each member of the audit committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Arca and the audit committee charter.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P24_S1	The Board has further determined that each of Messrs. Ellis and Fobes have accounting or related financial management expertise, as required by the NYSE Arca, such that each of them is considered an Audit Committee Financial Expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P25_S0	Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of UGA are not compensated by UGA, but instead by USCF, UGA does not have a compensation committee.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P25_S1	Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P26_S0	USCF believes that it is necessary for each member of the Board to possess many qualities and skills.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P26_S1	USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P26_S2	There have not been any vacancies on USCF s Board since the commencement of operations of UGA in April 2007; however, if such a vacancy were to occur, the members of the Board would consider a candidate s management experience as well as his/her background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity and ethics.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P26_S3	In connection with this, the Board would also consider issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and skills.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P27_S0	The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board believes that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P28_S0	The Board of USCF has adopted a Corporate Governance Policy that applies to UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P28_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Corporate Governance Policy on its website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P28_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the Corporate Governance Policy, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P29_S0	USCF has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code of Ethics ) that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, and also to UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P29_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Code of Ethics on its website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P29_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the Code of Ethics, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P29_S3	UGA intends to disclose any amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics applicable to USCF s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, on its website.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P30_S0	In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy of USCF, the non-management directors of the Board (who are the same as the independent directors of the Board) meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions, without the presence of Management Directors or executive officers of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P30_S1	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis to preside over each such executive session.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P30_S2	Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Ellis by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P31_S0	The Board of USCF is led by a Chairman, Nicholas Gerber, who is also the President and CEO of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P31_S1	The Board s responsibilities include: (i) the selection, evaluation, retention and succession of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the selection and performance of other executive officers, (ii) understanding, reviewing and monitoring the implementation of strategic plans, annual operating plans and budgets, (iii) the selection and oversight of UGA s independent auditors and the oversight of UGA s financial statements, (iv) advising management on significant issues, (v) the review and approval of significant company actions and certain other matters, (vi) nominating directors and committee members and overseeing effective corporate governance and (vii) the consideration of other constituencies, such as USCF s and UGA s customers, employees, suppliers and the communities impacted by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P31_S2	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis as the presiding independent director.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P31_S3	Mr. Ellis role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P32_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF, including investing in the futures contracts and other commodity interests in order to track the benchmark futures contracts of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P32_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading the discussion and execution of new strategic objectives.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P33_S0	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P33_S1	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P33_S2	The Board believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer facilitates information flow between USCF and the Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as over-the-counter swap contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P34_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P35_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P36_S0	The Board also determines compensation payable to employees of USCF, including the portfolio managers of each of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P36_S1	The compensation of certain employees of USCF is, in part, based on the amount of assets under management by UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P36_S2	The Board feels that compensating certain employees, in part, based on the amount of assets under management is appropriate since having more assets in a fund generally reflects that investors perceive the fund s investment objective is being met.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in over-the-counter swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including over-the-counter swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any over-the-counter swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P37_S5	In making compensation decisions, the Board considers whether a compensation arrangement would expose UGA or the Related Public Funds to additional risks and whether the risks posed by such arrangement are consistent with the best interests of UGA s investors.
1396878_15_ITEM10_P38_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P0_S0	UGA does not directly compensate any of the executive officers noted above.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P0_S3	UGA pays fees to USCF pursuant to the LP Agreement under which it is obligated to pay USCF an annualized fee of 0.60% of its average daily net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P0_S4	For 2014, UGA accrued aggregate management fees of $294,290.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following table sets forth compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2014, by the directors of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P1_S1	UGA s portion of the aggregate fees paid to the directors for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6,848.
1396878_15_ITEM11_P2_S0	(1) Mr. Fobes serves as chairman of the audit committee of USCF and receives additional compensation in recognition of the additional responsibilities he has undertaken in this role.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P0_S0	UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P0_S1	However, there have been no direct financial transactions between UGA and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P1_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction with a related person that must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K item 404(a), including financial transactions by UGA with directors or executive officers of USCF or holders of beneficial interests in USCF or UGA of more than 5%, will be subject to the provisions regarding Resolutions of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care as set forth in Section 7.7 of the LP Agreement and will be reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the Board of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2015, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_15_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_15_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
1396878_15_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for (i) the audit of UGA s annual financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and certain of UGA s current reports on Form 8-K; and (ii) services that are normally provided by the Independent Registered Public Accountants in connection with statutory and regulatory filings of registration statements.
1396878_15_ITEM14_P2_S0	Tax fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and partnership income tax return filings.
1396878_15_ITEM14_P3_S0	The audit committee has established policies and procedures which are intended to control the services provided by UGA s independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence.
1396878_15_ITEM14_P3_S1	Under these policies and procedures, no audit or permitted non-audit services (including fees and terms thereof), except for the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, may be undertaken by UGA s independent auditors unless the engagement is specifically pre-approved by the audit committee.
1396878_15_ITEM14_P4_S0	The audit committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals must be presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P0_S0	See Index to Financial Statements on page 56.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P1_S0	No financial statement schedules are filed herewith because (i) such schedules are not required or (ii) the information required has been presented in the aforementioned financial statements.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P2_S0	Exhibits required to be filed by Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	Finally, you should know that this Code is designed to satisfy the standards contained in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	U.S. federal courts are bound to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations when sentencing companies convicted of federal offenses arising from the illegal acts of one or more employees.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P18_S2	The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations provide for substantial leniency in sentencing of a company from otherwise severe mandatory penalties, where the company had in effect an adequate compliance program at the time of the illegal activity.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	A conflict exists when your personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P19_S2	For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:
1396878_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another s personal benefit.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when the opportunity to do so presents itself.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	compete, or prepare to compete, with us.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P29_S2	You must not trade the shares of any Fund, or the securities of our affiliates, our service providers, or any of our other business partners while in the possession of inside information.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	In order to prevent conflicts of interest from occurring where USCF or its officers, directors, principals or employees could give preferential treatment to their own trading accounts or trade their accounts ahead of or against any of the Funds, USCF and its officers, directors, principals and employees are each prohibited from trading futures contracts or other commodity interests in which any of the Funds invests.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	You must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	You must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	You may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Please talk to any member of management if you have any questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex, religion, age, national origin, disability, political affiliation or belief, citizenship, sexual orientation or transgender status, or any other status protected by law.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P34_S2	These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	This includes such data as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	No false or artificial entries may be made.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	In addition to procedures intended to safeguard against a Fund fact-sheet being misleading or deceptive, it is a USCF policy that Fund fact-sheets may only be distributed to the public when accompanied by the current applicable Fund prospectus.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	As noted above, all content to be included on a Fund website is reviewed and approved by USCF s counsel prior to publication of such content on such website.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	A review of website information is performed each time new information placed on the website would lead to a substantively new version of the web page.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	The review and approval of website material is documented by the supervisor in charge of such review.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	USCF does not allow the use of personal websites by its employees or agents for the solicitation of business to any of the Funds.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	USCF, or its service providers, maintains the supporting documentation for all statements, claims and performance results referenced in promotional material prepared by or on behalf of the Funds.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P49_S3	This type of review is performed in conformity with NFA and FINRA guidance on e-mail review, in consideration of the fact that USCF generally communicates with institutional or relatively sophisticated clients, while USCF s marketing agent handles most communication with the general public.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P50_S3	Under some circumstances, it may be impractical or you may feel uncomfortable raising a matter with your supervisor.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P50_S4	In those instances, you are encouraged to contact our Chief Compliance Officer or General Counsel who will investigate and report the matter to the Board of Directors, as the circumstance dictates.

1396878_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	All reports will be investigated and whenever possible, requests for confidentiality shall be honored.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	And, while anonymous reports will be accepted, please understand that anonymity may hinder or impede the investigation of a report.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	All cases of questionable activity or improper actions will be reviewed for appropriate action, discipline or corrective actions.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P52_S3	Whenever possible, we will keep confidential the identity of employees, officers or directors who are accused of violations , unless or until it has been determined that a violation has occurred.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	There will be no reprisal, retaliation or adverse action taken against any employee who, in good faith, reports or assists in the investigation of, a violation or suspected violation, or who makes an inquiry about the appropriateness of an anticipated or actual course of action.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	For reporting concerns about the conduct of the Company, or any Fund, the conduct of an officer of the Company, or about accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters of the Company, or any Fund, you may use the following means of communication:

1396878_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	All complaints received by any associated person of USCF or any Fund are to be forwarded to the Chief Compliance Officer.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	Associated persons have been instructed to forward to the Chief Compliance Officer any oral questions that cannot be readily addressed so that such questions can be treated as complaints if the Chief Compliance Officer deems necessary.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P57_S3	It is the general policy of USCF, and the Funds to answer all complaints.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P57_S4	A discussion of any complaints received will be an agenda item at each quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Chief Compliance Officer s duties with respect to shareholder complaints include: (1) maintaining a log that documents all complaints, (2) investigating complaints as needed, (3) making a recommendation for resolution of all complaints received, and (4) instituting any necessary changes to policies and procedures in connection with or in response to complaints.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	USCF maintains records of all written complaints that are received by any party in connection with the Funds, as well as records relating to the resolution of such complaints.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	In light of the responsibilities placed on USCF s marketing agent, it is likely that the marketing agent will also receive complaints from shareholders from time to time.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The marketing agent will address these complaints pursuant to its own procedures, but notice of such complaints will be forwarded to the Chief Compliance Officer to be documented in the complaint log.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The marketing agent will be responsible for addressing any complaints that it receives pursuant to the marketing agent s own procedures and will forward notice of material complaints to the Chief Compliance Officer.
1396878_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Chief Compliance Officer must follow the complaint handling procedures described below:
1396878_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	All violations of the Code will result in appropriate corrective action, up to and including dismissal.

1396878_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes, in percentage terms, in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per share NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2014.

1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	Prices hit a peak on June 24, 2014 of $3.0965 per gallon.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	The low for the year was on December 29, 2014, when the prices dropped to $1.4670 per gallon.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.4721 per gallon, down approximately 47.16% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S5	UGA s per share NAV began the year at $59.89 and ended the year at $33.90 on December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately 43.40% over the year.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P10_S6	UGA s per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 20, 2014 at $64.13 and reached its low for the year on December 29, 2014 at $33.79.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2014 contract and ended with the February 2015 contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decrease of approximately 47.16% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the gasoline futures market exhibited periods of both contango and backwardation, with the market in backwardation the majority of the time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The per share NAV of UGA s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 300,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s shares no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2014, UGA had issued 9,700,000 shares, 1,200,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2014, there were 70,300,000 shares registered but not yet issued.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	More shares may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2014, UGA had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., NewEdge USA LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease in the per share NAV for December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was a result of lower prices for gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts held and traded by UGA; and the increase in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to December 31, 2012, was a result of higher prices for gasoline and the related increase in the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts held and traded by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	UGA s decrease in cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds for December 31, 2014, compared to year ended December 31, 2013; and for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, were the result of UGA s smaller size as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were similar during the year ended December 31, 2014, and were similar for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012, as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The decrease in total fees and expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013; and for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to year ended December 31, 2012, was due to UGA s smaller size as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers as a percentage of net assets for December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was similar; and was also similar for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to December 31, 2012, as a percentage of net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were similar during the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012; and during the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, as measured by total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	UGA s total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013, were similar, as were the three months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The total commissions accrued to brokers by UGA for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013, were similar, as were the three months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012, as measured by total net assets .
1396878_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that average daily changes in its per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the average daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed gasoline Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2014, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was (1.027)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was (1.03)%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.242)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2014, the last trading day in December.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Since December 2009 to December 31, 2014, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.005%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.002%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.936)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (43.40)%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $59.89 on December 31, 2013 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2014 of $33.90.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $34.16 as of December 31, 2014, for a total return over the relevant time period of (42.96)%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (43.40)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (42.96)% was an error over the time period of (0.44)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $13,292, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.03% for such period.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA also collected $6,650 from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA incurred net expenses of $402,672.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $(382,730) which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.78)% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2013, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 2.57%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $58.39 on December 31, 2012 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2013 of $59.89.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $60.46 as of December 31, 2013, for a total return over the relevant time period of 3.54%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 2.57% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 3.54% was an error over the time period of (0.97)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA pays, offset in part by the income that UGA collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $14,479, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.02% for such period.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA also collected $5,600 from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA incurred net expenses of $546,537.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $(526,458) which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.90)% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2012, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 20.72%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $48.37 on December 31, 2011 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2012 of $58.39.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $58.89 as of December 31, 2012, for a total return over the relevant time period of 21.75%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 20.72% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 21.75% was an error over the time period of (1.03)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that UGA paid, offset in part by the income that UGA collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA earned dividend and interest income of $26,007, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.03% for such period.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA also collected $12,250 from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S8	This income also contributed to UGA s actual total return.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2012, UGA incurred net expenses of $803,038.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P35_S10	Income from dividends and interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $(764,781), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.83)% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Second, UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fees, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	At the same time, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA earned, on an annualized basis, approximately 0.03% on its cash and cash equivalent holdings.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	It also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of (0.60)% for management fees, approximately (0.08)% in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts, and approximately (0.51)% for other expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Using the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 8%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P47_S6	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Using again the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	In this example, it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P48_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years for gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P49_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2014.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	For example, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2013 and held to December 31, 2014 decreased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately (43.40)%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period decreased by (47.16)% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2012 and held to December 31, 2013 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 2.57%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 0.88% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was primarily impacted by sharply declining crude oil prices in the United States .
1396878_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2014 at $2.7859 per gallon.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Prices hit a peak on June 24, 2014 of $3.0965 per gallon before falling for the remainder of the year.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	The low for the year was on December 29, 2014, when the price dropped to $1.4670 per gallon.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.4721 per gallon, down approximately (47.16)% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	On the consumption side, demand growth remained moderate inside and outside the United States as global economic growth, including emerging economies such as China and India, showed signs of slow economic growth.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Europe in particular showed signs of weakness as the ongoing financial and banking crisis raised concerns during the first quarter of 2013.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	On the supply side, efforts to reduce production in recent years by OPEC to more closely match global consumption were partially successful.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	However, continuing concerns about the political standoff with Iran have left the market subject to bouts of heightened volatility as OPEC s ability to replace Iranian oil currently subject to embargo is not unlimited.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P56_S5	In addition, security issues in Libya, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria also contributed to heightened volatility.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	In recent years, oil production in the United States and Canada has increased.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	However, limits on oil transportation infrastructure, including pipelines, have made it more difficult for the increased production to move to the centers of refining, often leading to a build-up in crude oil inventory in areas of the United States, such as the U.S. Midwest, and Canada.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	The result is that crude oil prices in the U.S. Midwest, where the pricing point of the light, sweet crude oil contract is located, have tended to trade at a lower price than crude oil in other parts of the United States and lower than global crude oil benchmarks such as Brent crude oil.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	United States crude oil prices finished the year ended December 31, 2014 approximately 45.87% higher than at the beginning of the year, as the global economy continues to adjust to periods of slow recovery and economic growth.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	USCF believes that should the global economic situation cease to improve, or decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels, while any military actions involving Iran would likely have the opposite effect.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	For the ten year time period between 2004 and 2014, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of unleaded gasoline on a monthly basis was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated with the movements of large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds, global equities or natural gas.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	However, movements in unleaded gasoline were strongly correlated to movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Over the one-year period ended December 31, 2014, unleaded gasoline was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated with large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds, global equities, and natural gas.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Unleaded gasoline remained strongly correlated with crude oil and diesel-heating oil over the shorter period.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with daily changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its over-the-counter contracts and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at the Custodian and in investments in Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S7	By comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2013, UGA s expensed exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S8	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, UGA used other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a decrease in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P70_S9	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P71_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	Since the initial offering of shares, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	An FCM, when acting on behalf of UGA in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases over-the-counter contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of over-the-counter contracts.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2014, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $41,718,871 with the Custodian and FCM.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should the Custodian and/or FCM cease operations.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2014, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	UGA had no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of December 31, 2014 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.

1396878_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least June 30, 2015.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P86_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to a FCM), over-the-counter dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Commission payments to a FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of gasoline, in percentage terms.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The shares issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Creation Baskets .
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets, are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P24_S5	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	While UGA issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares traded on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, on a percentage basis.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of B , where:
1396878_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s share price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in UGA s per share NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UGA s per share NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contract, will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in Futures Contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the OTC market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UGA s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the ICE Futures, the Singapore Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Most significantly, futures exchanges and, for certain contracts, the CFTC, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment in UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	The net position is the difference between an individual s or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition, most U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S. based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The current accountability level for investments for any one month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2015, UGA held 1,427 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2015, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA did not exceed position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	See The Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with an FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its OTC contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	While the gasoline Futures Contracts can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transaction).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts and EFRP transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	BBH Co. s principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110-1548.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	BBH Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	BBH Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law 160 181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	BBH Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	UGA also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	ALPS Distributors principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	On October 8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM, effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to UGA, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P84_S2	For the period October 10, 2013 and after, UGA pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	RBC Capital s primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Effective October 10, 2013, RBC Capital became the futures clearing broker for UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	RBC is a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	As a result, certain of RBC's regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect to issues raised in various investigations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P87_S3	In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P87_S4	RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	RBC has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	RBC is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC's business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	RBC contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	On June 18, 2015, in connection with the SEC's Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) initiative, the SEC commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital Markets, LLC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	RBC paid a fine of $500,000.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	On July 31, 2015, RBC Capital Markets, LLC was added as a new defendant in a pending putative class action initially filed in November 2013 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on 0.60% per annum on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of total net assets on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	Total net assets are calculated by taking the current market value of UGA s total assets and subtracting any liabilities.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P125_S2	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P125_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P125_S4	The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P127_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P127_S2	Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated by:
1396878_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S4	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S5	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P132_S6	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P133_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P133_S2	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P133_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S1	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S2	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S3	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S4	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S5	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S6	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S7	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P134_S8	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P135_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P135_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA shares on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P136_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P136_S2	If the market price of UGA shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P136_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P136_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P137_S0	UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P137_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P138_S0	Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P138_S1	Authorized Participants must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P138_S2	To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA (each such agreement, an Authorized Participant Agreement ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P138_S3	The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P138_S4	The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P139_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2014 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P139_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P139_S2	As of December 31, 2015, 12 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P140_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA issued 40 Creation Baskets and redeemed 12 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P141_S0	Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P141_S1	In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P141_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P142_S0	Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P142_S1	Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P142_S2	Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P143_S0	Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and UGA under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P144_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P145_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P145_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P145_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P146_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P147_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P147_S2	Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P148_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P148_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant s purchase of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P150_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P150_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P152_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P152_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	UGA s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P157_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P157_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P157_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P157_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P158_S1	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P158_S2	An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P159_S1	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P159_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P159_S3	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant s sale of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P160_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P160_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P160_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P161_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P161_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P161_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P161_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P161_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P162_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P162_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P162_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an OTC contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P162_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P163_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P163_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P163_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P164_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P164_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P164_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P164_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P165_S0	Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P166_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P166_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S1	Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S2	An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S3	Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S4	The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between UGA s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P167_S5	Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P168_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P168_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P169_S0	Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P169_S1	Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P169_S2	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P169_S3	While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P169_S4	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P170_S0	USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P170_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P171_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P171_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P171_S2	Counterparties in transactions in OTC Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P171_S3	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P171_S4	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_16_ITEM1_P172_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P173_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P173_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P174_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P174_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P174_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P175_S0	An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P175_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P176_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P177_S0	If UGA enters into a swap agreement, UGA must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P177_S1	The amount of collateral UGA posts changes according to the amounts owed by UGA to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by UGA at the start of a swap transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P177_S2	Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P178_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P178_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction ( e.g., retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P179_S0	The offer and sale of shares of UGA, as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P180_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P180_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P181_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P181_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P181_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P182_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P182_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P182_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P183_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P183_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P183_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P184_S6	In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P185_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P185_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P186_S0	Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P186_S1	The exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P187_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P187_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P187_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P188_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P188_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P188_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P189_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P189_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P189_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P190_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P190_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P191_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P191_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P192_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P192_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P192_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P192_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P193_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P193_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P193_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P193_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P193_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P194_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P195_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P195_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P195_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P196_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P196_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P197_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P197_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P197_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P198_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P198_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P199_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P200_S0	Clearing refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member ( i.e. , an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P200_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P200_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P200_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P201_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P201_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P202_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P202_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P202_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P203_S0	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P204_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P204_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P204_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P205_S0	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P205_S1	Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P206_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P206_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P206_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P207_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P207_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P207_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P208_S0	The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P209_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P209_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P210_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P210_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P210_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P211_S0	Regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P211_S1	The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P212_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P212_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P213_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO and their respective associated persons.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P214_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P214_S1	Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P214_S2	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P214_S3	In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P215_S0	The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P215_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P215_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P216_S0	The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control ( the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P216_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P216_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P217_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P217_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P217_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P217_S3	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P218_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P218_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P218_S2	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P219_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P219_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P220_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P220_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P221_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P221_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P221_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P221_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P222_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P222_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P222_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P223_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P223_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P223_S2	With respect to trading by UGA, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P224_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P225_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P225_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P225_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P226_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P227_S0	In October 2015 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants (Swap Entities) that are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities, and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P228_S0	When they take effect, the Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities, and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Final Margin Rules), to a mandatory two-way minimum initial margin requirement.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P228_S1	The minimum amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that is approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P228_S2	The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with financial end users (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P229_S0	The Final Margin Rules will require minimum variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P229_S1	The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously posted or collected.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P229_S2	For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be posted or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P229_S3	Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P230_S0	UGA is not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules but it is a financial end-user.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P230_S1	Accordingly, UGA will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules, which will become effective for UGA on March 1, 2017.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P230_S2	However, UGA will not have material swaps exposure and, accordingly, UGA will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P231_S0	The CFTC and the SEC are required to adopt their own versions of the Final Margin Rules that are comparable to the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P231_S1	The CFTC s and SEC s rules will only apply to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P232_S0	The CFTC finalized its margin rules on December 16, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P232_S1	The CFTC s rules are substantially the same as the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P232_S2	The SEC has yet to finalize its margin rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P233_S0	Regulations require that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations ( derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract and such contract is made available to trade on a swap execution facility.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P233_S1	Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P233_S2	As a result, if UGA enters into any of the interest rate or index-based credit default swaps that are subject to these requirements, such swaps will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P233_S3	Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P233_S4	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P234_S0	Swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P234_S1	If UGA engages in non-cleared swap transactions it may be subject to some or all of these requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P235_S0	In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation ( EMIR ).
1396878_16_ITEM1_P235_S1	EMIR imposes requirements on non-cleared derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the CFTC and other regulators in the United States and which are described above.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P236_S0	UGA may be indirectly impacted by EMIR to the extent that it engages in derivatives transactions with counterparties that are subject to EMIR.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P237_S0	UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P237_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P238_S0	UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P239_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND (U.S. Reg.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P239_S1	No. 3486625) for Fund investment services in the field of gasoline futures contracts, cash-settled options on gasoline futures contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, OTC transactions based on the price of gasoline, and indices based on the foregoing, in use since February 22, 2008, UGA UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND, LP (and Design) (U.S. Reg.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P239_S5	So long as USCF continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations, it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P240_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for USCF (U.S. Reg.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P240_S1	No. 3638987) for fund investment services, in use since June 24, 2008, and USCF UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS LLC Design (U.S. Reg.

1396878_16_ITEM1_P241_S0	USCF has been granted two patents Nos.
1396878_16_ITEM1_P241_S1	7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily percentage change in the net asset value ( NAV ) per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of unleaded gasoline, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	UGA s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in unleaded gasoline and to hedge against movements in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	An investment in UGA involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in UGA involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The net asset value of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by UGA and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The NAV of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of unleaded gasoline in the marketplace.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for unleaded gasoline correlates closely with general economic growth rates.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on unleaded gasoline prices.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Other factors that may affect the demand for unleaded gasoline and therefore its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for unleaded gasoline associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce unleaded gasoline prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Other factors impacting the gasoline market.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The supply of and demand for unleaded gasoline may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy sources.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Investing in UGA s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks:
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than net asset value.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	UGA s NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of UGA s portfolio investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the unleaded gasoline and the Benchmark Futures Contract at any point in time.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The NAV of UGA s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet, light unleaded gasoline trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global gasoline market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Daily percentage changes in UGA s net asset value may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in UGA s NAV per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for unleaded gasoline, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As UGA approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, UGA may begin investing in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, UGA is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract because the total return generated by UGA is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with UGA s trading activities, and increased by interest income from UGA s holdings of Treasury securities.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract requires trading of UGA s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract and the spot price of unleaded gasoline may at times be only approximate.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Futures Contract) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and technical influences in oil futures trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Natural forces in the oil futures market known as backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In the event of an unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Conversely, in the event of a unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of unleaded gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of UGA s per share NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control the Position Limit Rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Position Limit Rules, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues -- OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts ).
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products ( e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products ( e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	See The Commodity Interest Markets- Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in unleaded gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed unleaded gasoline futures.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Currently, OTC transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade OTC Gasoline Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	OTC contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The markets for OTC contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	While certain regulations adopted over the past two years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the OTC market, the current regulation of the OTC contracts could expose UGA in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	As a result of such regulations, if UGA enters into certain interest rate and credit default swaps, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the OTC market will be subject to much more extensive regulatory oversight.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its unleaded gasoline production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA's Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The large size of the positions that UGA may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	OTC contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	UGA is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	UGA is not actively managed by conventional methods.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Accordingly, if UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests are declining in value, UGA will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	USCF will seek to cause the NAV of UGA s shares to track the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in UGA s shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	UGA s shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of UGA s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In the event that one or more Authorized Participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors incurring a loss on their investment.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets, and the conditions associated with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors investment in the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Only Authorized Participants may create or redeem Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	All other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through the NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the shares may be traded.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV per share.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The lack of an active trading market for UGA s shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in UGA at the time the investor sells the shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Although UGA s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage UGA and other funds.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of UGA, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. John P. Love and Stuart P. Crumbaugh.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If Messrs. Love or Crumbaugh were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Furthermore, Messrs. Love or Crumbaugh are currently involved in the management of the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The LLC Agreement provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF s parent company, which is a closely-held private company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by one person.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	USCF s Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, each of whom are shareholders of USCF s parent, Wainwright Holdings, Inc.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	( Wainwright ), and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Under USCF s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company s Board of Directors.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In addition, any Director may be removed by written consent of Wainwright, which is the sole member of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Wainwright is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are held by or on behalf of Nicholas D. Gerber and his immediate family members (the Gerber Family ).
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Historically, shares of Wainwright have been voted by, and on behalf of, the Gerber Family by Nicholas D. Gerber, and it is anticipated that such trend will continue in the future.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and UGA, including their regulatory obligations.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, and OTC spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA's performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on unleaded gasoline prices and unleaded gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA's investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of unleaded gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Trading on such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, UGA is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P89_S4	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	UGA is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with UGA have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of UGA and the shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	UGA may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the FCM, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P95_S2	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P95_S3	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P97_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P97_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P99_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if the investor will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Nonetheless, although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g. , at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P99_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on UGA s net asset value.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P101_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted to reform money market funds such that institutional prime money market funds will float their net asset value as well as impose rules such that all money market funds boards of directors will be required to implement rules to discourage and prevent runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Money market funds have two years from the date of adoption to implement the reform .
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	UGA currently invests in money market funds, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P103_S1	It is unclear at this time what the impact of money market reform would have on UGA s ability to hedge risk, however, the imposition of a floating net asset value could cause UGA to limit remaining assets solely in Treasuries and cash.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	As the regulatory requirements are constantly evolving, it is difficult to predict the effect any regulatory changes may have on UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a clearing broker or an Exchange s clearing house, UGA could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	If such a bankruptcy were to occur, UGA would be afforded the protections granted to customers of a futures commission merchant, or FCM, and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable CFTC regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P106_S3	In any case, there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing UGA to recover all, or even any, of the amounts it has deposited as margin.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Bankruptcy of a clearing FCM can be caused by, among other things, the default of one of the FCM s customers.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P107_S1	In this event, the Exchange s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by UGA (as well as margin posted by other customers of the FCM) to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Consequently, UGA could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its futures positions, including assets posted as margin, and could sustain substantial losses.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	On January 13, 2014, new regulations became effective relating to enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and 20 examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	There can be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, UGA or its investors.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Notwithstanding that UGA could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its FCM, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P111_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	It is possible that third parties might utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P113_S1	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P114_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Due to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, UGA is susceptible to operational and information security risks.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P116_S1	In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P116_S3	Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P116_S4	Cyber security failures or breaches of UGA s clearing broker or third party service provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of UGA shareholders to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P117_S1	UGA and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.
1396878_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	While UGA has established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such plans.
1396878_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.

1396878_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes, in percentage terms, in the price of the futures contract for unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per share NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV or market price of shares will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2015 and exhibited an uptrend through early June and a downward trend for the remainder of the year.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $1.4721 per gallon.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Prices hit a peak on June 10, 2015 of $2.146 per gallon.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	The low for the year was on December 22, 2015, when the prices dropped to $1.119 per gallon.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.271 per gallon, down approximately (13.66)% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	UGA s per share NAV began the year at $33.90 and ended the year at $29.30 on December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately (13.57)% over the year.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	UGA s per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 10, 2015 at $42.35 and reached its low for the year on December 22, 2015 at $27.34.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2015 contract and ended with the February 2016 contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The decrease of approximately (13.66)% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the gasoline futures market exhibited periods of both contango and backwardation, with the market in backwardation the majority of the time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The per share NAV of UGA s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 300,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s shares no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2015, UGA had issued 11,700,000 shares, 2,600,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	As of December 31, 2015, there were 68,300,000 shares registered but not yet issued.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	More shares may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	As of December 31, 2015, UGA had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The decrease in the per share NAV for December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was a result of lower prices for gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts held and traded by UGA; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to December 31, 2013, was a result of lower prices for gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts held and traded by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were similar during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014; for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended 2013 average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA were similar.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was similar during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended 2014 and similar during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in total fees and expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to UGA s larger size as measured by total net assets; and the decrease in total fees and expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended December 31, 2013, was due to UGA s smaller size as measured by total net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers as a percentage of net assets for December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, were higher due to a higher number of gasoline-linked instruments; and were similar for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013, as a percentage of net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to lower prices for gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the gasoline Futures Contracts in which UGA invested; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013, was a result of lower prices for gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts held and traded by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	UGA s total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 were higher due to UGA s larger size as measured by total net assets; and for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013, UGA s total fees and other expenses excluding management fees were similar.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers as a percentage of net assets for December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, were higher due to a higher number of gasoline-linked instruments; and were similar for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013, as a percentage of net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in gasoline Futures Contracts, other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2015, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.157%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.155%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The average daily difference was (.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	NAV was 0.185%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2015, the last trading day in December.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Since December 2009 to December 31, 2015, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.0013%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was (0.0013)%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The average daily difference was (0.0026) % (or (0.26) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.855)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (13.57)%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $33.90 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $29.30.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $29.50 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of (12.98)%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (13.57)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (12.98)% was an error over the time period of 0.59%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return outperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (43.40)%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $59.89 on December 31, 2013 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2014 of $33.90.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $34.16 as of December 31, 2014, for a total return over the relevant time period of (42.96)%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (43.40)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (42.96)% was an error over the time period of (0.44)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	The impact of these expenses tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2013, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 2.57%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $58.39 on December 31, 2012 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2013 of $59.89.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $60.46 as of December 31, 2013, for a total return over the relevant time period of 3.54%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 2.57% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 3.54% was an error over the time period of (0.97)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The impact of these expenses tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Second, UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	At the same time, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as contango in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery (the spot price), was $2 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $2.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Over time, the price of a gallon of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for gasoline relative to its supply.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the gasoline, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the expected price of gasoline in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Using the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of gasoline, or fall slower.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 8%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P47_S6	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	If the futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Using again the $2 per gallon price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	In this example, it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of gasoline, or fall faster.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of gasoline to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	The chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years for gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	When the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract (backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	In addition, investors can observe that gasoline prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of gasoline tends to rise in the summer months and decline in the winter months.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P49_S5	This mirrors the physical demand for gasoline, which typically peaks in the summer.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	An alternative way to view backwardation and contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	If the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in contango.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	For example, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2014 and held to December 31, 2015 decreased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately (13.57)%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period decreased by (13.66)% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2013 and held to December 31, 2014 decreased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately (43.40)%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period decreased by (47.16)% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was primarily impacted by the excess supply of crude oil, the input product for gasoline, which resulted in lower prices in the United States.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2015 at $1.4721 per gallon.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Prices hit a peak on June 10, 2015 of $2.146 per gallon before falling for the remainder of the year.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	The low for the year was on December 22, 2015, when the price dropped to $1.119 per gallon.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.271 per gallon, down approximately (13.66)% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) decision in late 2014 to maintain production levels despite falling demand led to an oversupplied market.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	The amount of crude in storage in the U.S. increased consistently from the start of the year to late April before beginning to decline on moderately reduced output from shale producers and other sources.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	However, storage remained elevated relative to previous levels and began to rise again in late summer, approaching the peak level of 491 million barrels reported in April, the highest volume since the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) began reporting storage data in 1982.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	U.S. crude oil inventories grew to approximately 490 million barrels by the end of December, approximately 26% higher than the same week a year earlier and the five-year average storage level.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S5	United States crude oil prices finished the year ended December 31, 2015 approximately 30.47% lower than at the beginning of the year.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S6	Prices fluctuated as investors weighed the possibility that global inventories may stabilize in 2016.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P56_S7	Should supply continue to grow or should the global economic situation decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could fall further, while disruptions due to conflict in the Middle East would likely have the opposite effect.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	For the ten year time period between 2005 and 2015, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of gasoline on a monthly basis was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated with the movements of large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds, global equities or natural gas.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	However, movements in gasoline were strongly correlated to movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2015, gasoline was neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated to movements in natural gas and strongly correlated with movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Gasoline was somewhat correlated with large cap U.S. equities and somewhat inversely correlated with U.S. government bonds.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at its custodian bank and in investments in bank Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S7	Similarly, during the year ended December 31, 2014, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S8	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, UGA used other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a decrease in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P69_S9	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P70_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	Since the initial offering of shares, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P72_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	UGA is not currently a member of any clearinghouse.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P75_S3	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P75_S4	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	An FCM, when acting on behalf of UGA in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	If, in the future, UGA purchases OTC swaps, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of OTC swaps.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2015, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $75,519,309 with the custodian and FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian or FCM, as applicable, cease operations.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2015, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	UGA had no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of December 31, 2015 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least April 30, 2016.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to an FCM), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Commission payments to an FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2015, UGA s portfolio consisted of 1,427 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2015, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures Europe.
1396878_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions) in the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s board of directors (the Board ).
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_16_ITEM7A_P10_S2	OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2015, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	The Fund s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P4_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, of the Fund and our report dated March 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

1396878_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P23_S3	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2015, UGA held 1,427 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	USCF is responsible for the management of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	USCF is a member of the National Futures Association (the NFA ) and became registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ) effective December 1, 2005 and a swaps firm on August 8, 2013.

1396878_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, each of USO s, UNG s, USL s and UHN s shares commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	USCF is also the general partner of the United States Short Oil Fund, LP ( DNO ), the United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP ( UNL ) and the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP ( BNO ), which listed their limited partnership shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbols DNO on September 24, 2009, UNL on November 18, 2009 and BNO on June 2, 2010, respectively.

1396878_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Net income (loss) per share is the difference between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The weighted average number of shares outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average share.

1396878_16_ITEM8_P52_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2013, these fees and expenses were $555,465 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P52_S7	UGA s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $13,365.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	As discussed in Note 4 below, UGA entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee that is equal to 0.015% on all net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, UGA incurred $12,365, $7,357 and $8,779, respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	These costs were approximately $164,000, $164,000 and $225,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	USCF paid certain expenses typically borne by UGA on a discretionary basis where expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through December 31, 2015.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P55_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, USCF waived $224,565 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P55_S4	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 Contracts and Agreements below.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution related services exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of UGA s offering.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The above fee does not include website construction and development, which are also borne by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of the Related Public Funds combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for the Related Public Funds combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once the Related Public Funds combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P59_S4	USCF also pays BBH Co. transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	On October 8, 2013, UGA entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	The agreement with RBC requires it to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	In accordance with the agreement, RBC Capital charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P60_S3	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P60_S4	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The increase in UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers was due to a larger number of futures contracts held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	UGA s total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, were similar.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	UGA engages in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Cleared swaps are OTC agreements that are eligible to be cleared by a clearinghouse, e.g., ICE Clear Europe, but which are not traded on an exchange.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	A cleared swap is created when the parties to an off-exchange OTC swap transaction agree to extinguish their OTC contract and replace it with a cleared swap.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	Cleared swaps are intended to provide the efficiencies and benefits that centralized clearing on an exchange offers to traders of futures contracts, including credit risk intermediation and the ability to offset positions initiated with different counterparties.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with an FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Buying and selling options on futures contracts exposes investors to the risks of purchasing or selling futures contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA through December 31, 2015 were exchange-traded.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with OTC swaps since, in OTC swaps, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the FCM s segregation requirements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	The insolvency of an FCM could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that FCM; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of an FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P75_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per share NAV.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in such money market funds.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, UGA held investments in money market funds in the amounts of $22,000,000 and $28,024,349, respectively.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	UGA also holds cash deposits with its custodian.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Pursuant to a written agreement with BBH Co., uninvested overnight cash balances are swept to offshore branches of U.S. regulated and domiciled banks located in Toronto, Canada, London, United Kingdom, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and Nassau, Bahamas, which are subject to U.S. regulation and regulatory oversight.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries in the amounts of $53,519,309 and $13,694,522, respectively, with the custodian and FCM.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian and/or FCM cease operations.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table presents per share performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	An individual shareholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2015 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2014 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, modifying ASU 2014-09.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	ASU 2015-14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	At this time, management does not believe there will be any impact to the Fund s financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	UGA has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
1396878_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	This evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	UGA maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in UGA s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of UGA if UGA had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UGA s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UGA have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	UGA is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	UGA s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to USCF and the Board of USCF regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	USCF s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth above under the heading, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in UGA s internal control over financial reporting during UGA s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UGA s internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_16_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Pursuant to the requirement under Rule 4.22 under the CEA, each month UGA publishes an account statement for its shareholders, which includes a Statement of Income (Loss) and a Statement of Changes in Net Asset Value.
1396878_16_ITEM9B_P0_S1	The account statement is furnished to the SEC on a current report on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and posted each month on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.

1396878_16_ITEM10_P33_S0	The Board of USCF has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes III, and Peter M. Robinson).
1396878_16_ITEM10_P33_S1	The audit committee is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on UGA s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P33_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the audit committee charter, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P34_S0	The Board has determined that each member of the audit committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Arca and the audit committee charter.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P34_S1	The Board has further determined that each of Messrs. Ellis and Fobes have accounting or related financial management expertise, as required by the NYSE Arca, such that each of them is considered an Audit Committee Financial Expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P35_S0	Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of UGA are not compensated by UGA, but instead by USCF, UGA does not have a compensation committee.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P35_S1	Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P36_S0	USCF believes that it is necessary for each member of the Board to possess many qualities and skills.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P36_S1	USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P37_S0	When vacancies in USCF s Board occur, the members of the Board consider a candidate s management experience as well as his/her background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity and ethics.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P37_S1	In connection with this, the Board also considers issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and skills.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P37_S2	The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board believes that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P38_S0	The Board of USCF has adopted a Corporate Governance Policy that applies to UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P38_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Corporate Governance Policy on its website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P38_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the Corporate Governance Policy, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P39_S0	USCF has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code of Ethics ) that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, and also to UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P39_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Code of Ethics on its website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P39_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the Code of Ethics, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P39_S3	UGA intends to disclose any amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics applicable to USCF s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, on its website.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P40_S0	In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy of USCF, the non-management directors of the Board (who are the same as the independent directors of the Board) meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions, without the presence of Management Directors or executive officers of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P40_S1	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis to preside over each such executive session.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P40_S2	Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Ellis by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P41_S0	The Board of USCF is led by a Chairman, Nicholas Gerber, Mr. John P. Love separately serves as USCF s President and Chief Executive Officer.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P41_S1	The Board s responsibilities include: (i) the selection, evaluation, retention and succession of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the selection and performance of other executive officers, (ii) understanding, reviewing and monitoring the implementation of strategic plans, annual operating plans and budgets, (iii) the selection and oversight of UGA s independent auditors and the oversight of UGA s financial statements, (iv) advising management on significant issues, (v) the review and approval of significant company actions and certain other matters, (vi) nominating directors and committee members and overseeing effective corporate governance and (vii) the consideration of other constituencies, such as USCF s and UGA s customers, employees, suppliers and the communities impacted by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P41_S2	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis as the presiding independent director.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P41_S3	Mr. Ellis role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P42_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF, including investing in the futures contracts and other commodity interests in order to track the benchmark futures contracts of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P42_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading discussions and execution of new strategic objectives while facilitating information flow between USCF and the full Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P42_S2	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P42_S3	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as OTC swap contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P43_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P44_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P45_S0	The Board also determines compensation payable to employees of USCF, including the portfolio managers of each of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P45_S1	The compensation of certain employees of USCF is, in part, based on the amount of assets under management by UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P45_S2	The Board feels that compensating certain employees, in part, based on the amount of assets under management is appropriate since having more assets in a fund generally reflects that investors perceive the fund s investment objective is being met.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in OTC swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including OTC swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any OTC swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P46_S5	In making compensation decisions, the Board considers whether a compensation arrangement would expose UGA or the Related Public Funds to additional risks and whether the risks posed by such arrangement are consistent with the best interests of UGA s investors.
1396878_16_ITEM10_P47_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P0_S0	UGA does not directly compensate any of the executive officers noted above.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P0_S3	UGA pays fees to USCF pursuant to the LP Agreement under which it is obligated to pay USCF an annualized fee of 0.60% of its average daily net assets.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P0_S4	For 2015, UGA accrued aggregate management fees of $494,612.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following table sets forth compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2015, by the directors of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P1_S1	UGA s portion of the aggregate fees paid to the directors for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10,840.
1396878_16_ITEM11_P2_S0	(1) Mr. Fobes serves as chairman of the audit committee of USCF and receives additional compensation in recognition of the additional responsibilities he has undertaken in this role.
1396878_16_ITEM12_P0_S0	None of the directors or executive officers of USCF, nor the employees of UGA own any shares of UGA.
1396878_16_ITEM12_P0_S1	In addition, UGA is not aware of any 5% holder of its shares.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P0_S0	UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P0_S1	However, there have been no direct financial transactions between UGA and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P1_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction with a related person that must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K item 404(a), including financial transactions by UGA with directors or executive officers of USCF or holders of beneficial interests in USCF or UGA of more than 5%, will be subject to the provisions regarding Resolutions of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care as set forth in Section 7.7 of the LP Agreement and will be reviewed and approved by the audit committee of the Board of USCF.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2016, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_16_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_16_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
1396878_16_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for (i) the audit of UGA s annual financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and certain of UGA s current reports on Form 8-K; (ii) the audit of UGA s internal control over financial reporting included in the annual report on Form 10-K; and (iii) services that are normally provided by the Independent Registered Public Accountants in connection with statutory and regulatory filings of registration statements.
1396878_16_ITEM14_P2_S0	Tax fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and partnership income tax return filings.
1396878_16_ITEM14_P3_S0	The audit committee has established policies and procedures which are intended to control the services provided by UGA s independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence.
1396878_16_ITEM14_P3_S1	Under these policies and procedures, no audit or permitted non-audit services (including fees and terms thereof), except for the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, may be undertaken by UGA s independent auditors unless the engagement is specifically pre-approved by the audit committee.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	Finally, you should know that this Code is designed to satisfy the standards contained in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P131_S1	U.S. federal courts are bound to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations when sentencing companies convicted of federal offenses arising from the illegal acts of one or more employees.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations provide for substantial leniency in sentencing of a company from otherwise severe mandatory penalties, where the company had in effect an adequate compliance program at the time of the illegal activity.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P132_S1	A conflict exists when your personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P132_S2	For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:
1396878_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another s personal benefit.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when the opportunity to do so presents itself.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P136_S2	All individuals involved in our SEC reporting process and in preparing and making public communications regarding our business must take all reasonable steps to comply with this policy.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P139_S1	You should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P140_S0	Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P141_S1	Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P142_S1	Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P142_S2	You must not trade the shares of any Fund, or the securities of our affiliates, our service providers, or any of our other business partners while in the possession of inside information.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	In order to prevent conflicts of interest from occurring where USCF or its officers, directors, principals or employees could give preferential treatment to their own trading accounts or trade their accounts ahead of or against any of the Funds, USCF and its officers, directors, principals and employees are each prohibited from trading futures contracts or other commodity interests in which any of the Funds invests.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P144_S1	You must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	You must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P145_S1	You may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	Please talk to any member of management if you have any questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex, religion, age, national origin, disability, political affiliation or belief, citizenship, sexual orientation or transgender status, or any other status protected by law.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P147_S1	With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P149_S1	No false or artificial entries may be made.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P150_S0	The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P150_S1	Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P151_S2	This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P151_S3	If you believe that this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, please contact our Chief Compliance Officer (the Chief Compliance Officer ).

1396878_16_ITEM15_P153_S2	Any requests from the media must be referred to him, unless another individual(s) is so authorized by the President and CEO.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P153_S3	In the event the President and CEO and other authorized individual(s) are not available, clearance must be obtained through the Chief Compliance Officer.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	In addition to procedures intended to safeguard against a Fund fact-sheet being misleading or deceptive, it is a USCF policy that Fund fact-sheets may only be distributed to the public when accompanied by the current applicable Fund prospectus.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	As noted above, all content to be included on a Fund website is reviewed and approved by USCF s counsel prior to publication of such content on such website.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	A review of website information is performed each time new information placed on the website would lead to a substantively new version of the web page.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P156_S2	The review and approval of website material is documented by the supervisor in charge of such review.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	USCF does not allow the use of personal websites by its employees or agents for the solicitation of business to any of the Funds.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	Not share this information with other employees except on a legitimate need to know basis.
1396878_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	We may provide an e-mail system and Internet access to certain of our employees to help them do their work.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	This type of review is performed in conformity with NFA and FINRA guidance on e-mail review, in consideration of the fact that USCF generally communicates with institutional or relatively sophisticated clients, while USCF s marketing agent handles most communication with the general public.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	And, while anonymous reports will be accepted, please understand that anonymity may hinder or impede the investigation of a report.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P170_S2	Associated persons have been instructed to forward to the Chief Compliance Officer any oral questions that cannot be readily addressed so that such questions can be treated as complaints if the Chief Compliance Officer deems necessary.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P170_S4	A discussion of any complaints received will be an agenda item at each quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors of USCF.

1396878_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	In light of the responsibilities placed on USCF s marketing agent, it is likely that the marketing agent will also receive complaints from shareholders from time to time.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) is a Delaware limited partnership organized on April 13, 2007.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	UGA maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests ( shares ) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).

1396878_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Audit Committee in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	UGA s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of gasoline, in percentage terms.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	The shares issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Creation Baskets .
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	The purchase price for Creation Baskets and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	While UGA issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares traded on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, on a percentage basis.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P33_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of B , where:
1396878_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in UGA s per share NAV on a percentage basis.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	USCF further believes that daily changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically closely tracked the daily changes in spot prices of gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline on a percentage basis, plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P36_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in Futures Contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the OTC market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P37_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UGA s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange and other U.S. and foreign exchanges.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Futures contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that UGA invests in to meet its investment objective.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price limits on futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit .
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	The current accountability level for investments for any one month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P57_S5	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA held 1,006 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	As of December 31, 2016, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA did not exceed position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P60_S5	See The Commodity Interest Markets Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required, subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that market participant (the Aggregation Rules ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with an FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its OTC contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	While the gasoline Futures Contracts can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transaction).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P79_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P79_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P83_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	BBH Co. s principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110-1548.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	BBH Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	BBH Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law 160 181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P85_S2	BBH Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	UGA also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	ALPS Distributors principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	On October 8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM, effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to UGA, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P88_S2	For the period October 10, 2013 and after, UGA pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	RBC Capital s primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Effective October 10, 2013, RBC Capital became the futures clearing broker for UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P90_S2	RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	RBC is a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	As a result, certain of RBC's regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect to issues raised in various investigations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P91_S4	RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	RBC has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P92_S2	RBC is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC's business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	RBC contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	On June 18, 2015, in connection with the SEC's Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) initiative, the SEC commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital Markets, LLC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	RBC and certain affiliates were named as defendants in a lawsuit relating to their role in transactions involving investments made by a number of Wisconsin school districts in certain collateralized debt obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	These transactions were also the subject of a regulatory investigation, which was resolved in 2011.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	RBC reached a final settlement with all parties in the civil litigation, and the civil action against RBC was dismissed with prejudice on December 6, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	Various regulators are conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of law by a number of banks and other entities, including RBC, regarding foreign exchange trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Since 2015, RBC is a named defendant, along with many other entities, in pending putative class actions in the U.S. and Canada regarding foreign exchange trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	Based on the facts currently known, the ultimate resolution of these collective matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on RBC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	On April 13, 2015, RBC s affiliate, Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas), was charged in France with complicity in tax fraud.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	The trial of this matter has concluded and a verdict was delivered on January 12, 2017, acquitting RBC and the other defendants.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Thornburg Mortgage Inc. (now known as TMST) and RBC were parties to a master repurchase agreement executed in September 2003 whereby TMST financed its purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	Upon TMST s default during the financial crisis, RBC valued TMST s collateral at allegedly deflated prices.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	After TMST s bankruptcy filing, TMST s trustee brought suit against RBC in 2011 for breach of contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P98_S3	In 2015, TMST was awarded more than $45 million in damages.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	The appeals court set a briefing schedule and simultaneously ordered the parties to participate in a mediation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	The parties have subsequently reached an agreement to settle the matter; a motion to approve the settlement was filed with the bankruptcy court on January 10, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	On October 14, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery) in a class action brought by former shareholders of Rural/Metro Corporation, held RBC Capital Markets, LLC liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by three Rural/Metro directors, but did not make an additional award for attorney s fees.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	A final judgment was entered on February 19, 2015 in the amount of US$93 million plus post judgment interest.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P109_S1	RBC has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K. RBC will not act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF or participate in the management of USCF or UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	RBC is not affiliated with UGA or USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	Therefore, neither USCF nor UGA believes that there are any conflicts of interest with RBC or its trading principals arising from its acting as UGA s FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	Currently, USCF does not employ commodity trading advisors for trading of UGA contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	USCF currently does, however, employ SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC as a trading advisor for USCI, CPER and USAG.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P111_S2	If, in the future, USCF does employ commodity trading advisors for UGA, it will choose each advisor based on arm s-length negotiations and will consider the advisor s experience, fees and reputation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	Minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to all funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	(2) The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	USCF also will pay transaction charge fees to BBH Co., ranging from $7.00 to $15.00 per transaction for the funds.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on 0.60% per annum on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P115_S1	Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of total net assets on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Total net assets are calculated by taking the current market value of UGA s total assets and subtracting any liabilities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	(4) Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of NAV on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its audit expenses, tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	These fees were approximately $178,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P129_S2	In addition, UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance for UGA and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UGA and the Related Public Funds organized as limited partnerships and, as of July 8, 2011, those Related Public Funds organized as a series of a Delaware statutory trust.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P129_S4	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $582,050 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P130_S2	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P130_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P130_S4	The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P131_S1	Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P131_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P132_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P132_S2	Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated by:
1396878_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S4	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S5	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P137_S6	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P138_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P138_S2	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P138_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S1	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S2	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S3	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S4	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S5	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S6	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P140_S7	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P141_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA shares on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P142_S2	If the market price of UGA shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P142_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P142_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P143_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	Authorized Participants must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P144_S2	To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA (each such agreement, an Authorized Participant Agreement ).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P144_S3	The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P144_S4	The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2016 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2017), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 to UGA for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P145_S2	As of December 31, 2016, 11 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P145_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA issued 24 Creation Baskets and redeemed 31 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P147_S1	Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P147_S2	Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and UGA under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P150_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P150_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P152_S2	Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P153_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P153_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant s purchase of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P155_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P155_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P157_S0	An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P157_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P157_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P158_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P158_S1	UGA s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P159_S0	but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_17_ITEM1_P160_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P161_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P162_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P162_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P162_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P162_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P162_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P163_S0	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P163_S1	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P163_S2	An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P164_S0	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P164_S1	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P164_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P164_S3	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant s sale of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P165_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P165_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P165_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P166_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P166_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P166_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P166_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P166_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P167_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P167_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P167_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an OTC contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P167_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P168_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P168_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P168_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P169_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P169_S1	From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants was $350 for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P169_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P169_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P170_S0	Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P171_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P171_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S1	Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S2	An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S3	Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S4	The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between UGA s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P172_S5	Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P173_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P173_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P174_S0	Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P174_S1	Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P174_S2	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P174_S3	While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P174_S4	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P175_S0	USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P175_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P176_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P176_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P176_S2	Counterparties in transactions in OTC Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P176_S3	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P176_S4	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_17_ITEM1_P177_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P178_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P178_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P179_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P179_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P179_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P180_S0	An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P180_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P181_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P182_S0	If UGA enters into a swap agreement, UGA must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P182_S1	The amount of collateral UGA posts changes according to the amounts owed by UGA to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by UGA at the start of a swap transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P182_S2	Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P183_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P183_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g., contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction ( e.g., retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P184_S0	The offer and sale of shares of UGA, as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P185_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P185_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P186_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P186_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P186_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P187_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P187_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P187_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P188_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P188_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P188_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P189_S6	Nevertheless, in some instances forward contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P190_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P190_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P191_S0	Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P191_S1	The exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P192_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P192_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P192_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P193_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P193_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P193_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P194_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P194_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P194_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P195_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P195_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P196_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P196_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P197_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P197_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P197_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P197_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P198_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P198_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P198_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P198_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P198_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P199_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P200_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P200_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P200_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P201_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P201_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P202_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P202_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P202_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P203_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P203_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P204_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P205_S0	Clearing refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member ( i.e. , an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P205_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P205_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is terminated and replaced by two mirror trades for which the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P205_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P206_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P206_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P207_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P207_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P207_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P208_S0	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P209_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P209_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P209_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P210_S0	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P210_S1	Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P211_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P211_S1	The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P211_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P212_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P212_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P212_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P213_S0	The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P214_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P214_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P215_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P215_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P215_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P216_S0	Regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P216_S1	The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P217_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P217_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P218_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO and their respective associated persons.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P219_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P219_S1	Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P219_S2	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P219_S3	In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P220_S0	The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P220_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P220_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P221_S0	As discussed above, the CFTC has proposed to adopt the Position Limits Rules, which would impose limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures, and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, in the agriculture, energy and metals markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P221_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P221_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P221_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P221_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P222_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P222_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P222_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P223_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required to comply with the Aggregation Rules which, subject to certain narrow exceptions, require the aggregation of all positions for which the market participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which the participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with the market participant.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P223_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such Position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P224_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P224_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P225_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P225_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P226_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P226_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P226_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P226_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P227_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P227_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P227_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P228_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P228_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P228_S2	With respect to trading by UGA, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P229_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P230_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P230_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P230_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P231_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P232_S0	In October 2015 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants (Swap Entities) that are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities, and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P233_S0	The Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities, and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Final Margin Rules), to a mandatory two-way minimum initial margin requirement.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P233_S1	The minimum amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that is approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P233_S2	The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with financial end users (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P234_S0	The Final Margin Rules will require minimum variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user).
1396878_17_ITEM1_P234_S1	The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously posted or collected.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P234_S2	For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be posted or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P234_S3	Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P235_S0	UGA is not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules but it is a financial end-user.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P235_S1	Accordingly, UGA will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules, which will become effective for UGA on March 1, 2017.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P235_S2	However, UGA will not have material swaps exposure and, accordingly, UGA will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P236_S0	The CFTC and the SEC are required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to adopt their own margin rules.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P236_S1	The CFTC s and SEC s rules will only apply to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P237_S0	The CFTC finalized its margin rules on December 16, 2015.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P237_S1	The CFTC s rules are substantially the same as the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P237_S2	The SEC has yet to finalize its margin rules.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P238_S0	CFTC regulations require that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations ( derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract and such contract is made available to trade on a swap execution facility.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P238_S1	Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P238_S2	As a result, if UGA enters into any of the interest rate or index-based credit default swaps that are subject to these requirements, such swaps will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P238_S3	Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P238_S4	If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P239_S0	In addition to the margin requirements described above, swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on an SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P240_S0	Other non-U.S. jurisdictions also impose obligations with respect to OTC swaps that could impact UGA if it were to engage in OTC swaps with non-U.S. persons.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P241_S0	UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P241_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P242_S0	UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P243_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND (U.S. Reg.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P243_S1	No. 3486625) for Fund investment services in the field of gasoline futures contracts, cash-settled options on gasoline futures contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, OTC transactions based on the price of gasoline, and indices based on the foregoing, in use since February 22, 2008, UGA UNITED STATES GASOLINE FUND, LP (and Design) (U.S. Reg.

1396878_17_ITEM1_P243_S4	USCF relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P243_S5	So long as USCF continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations, it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P244_S0	USCF owns trademark registrations for USCF (U.S. Reg.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P244_S1	No. 3638987) for fund investment services, in use since June 24, 2008, and USCF UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS LLC Design (U.S. Reg.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P244_S2	No. 4304004) for fund investment services, in use since June 24, 2008.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P244_S3	USCF relies upon these trademarks through which it markets its services and strives to build and maintain brand recognition in the market and among current and potential investors.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P244_S4	So long as USCF continues to use these trademarks to identify its services, without challenge from any third party, and properly maintains and renews the trademark registrations under applicable laws, rules and regulations; it will continue to have indefinite protection for these trademarks under current laws, rules and regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P245_S0	USCF has been granted two patents Nos.
1396878_17_ITEM1_P245_S1	7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of unleaded gasoline, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UGA s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	UGA s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in unleaded gasoline and to hedge against movements in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	An investment in UGA involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in UGA involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The net asset value of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by UGA and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The NAV of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of unleaded gasoline in the marketplace.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for unleaded gasoline correlates closely with general economic growth rates.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on unleaded gasoline prices.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Other factors that may affect the demand for unleaded gasoline and therefore its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for unleaded gasoline associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce unleaded gasoline prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Other factors impacting the gasoline market.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The supply of and demand for unleaded gasoline may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy sources.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Price Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Investing in UGA s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks:
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than net asset value.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	UGA s NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of UGA s portfolio investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the unleaded gasoline and the Benchmark Futures Contract at any point in time.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The NAV of UGA s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet, light unleaded gasoline trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global gasoline market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Daily percentage changes in UGA s net asset value may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in UGA s NAV per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for unleaded gasoline, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As UGA approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, UGA may begin investing in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, UGA is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract because the total return generated by UGA is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with UGA s trading activities, and increased by interest income from UGA s holdings of Treasury securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract requires trading of UGA s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract and the spot price of unleaded gasoline may at times be only approximate.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Futures Contract) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and technical influences in oil futures trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Natural forces in the oil futures market known as backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In the event of an unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Conversely, in the event of a unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of unleaded gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of UGA s per share NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As discussed above, the CFTC has proposed to adopt the Position Limit Rules, which would impose position limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, in the agriculture, energy and metals markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Position Limit Rules, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	See The Commodity Interest Markets- Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products ( e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products ( e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required to comply with the Aggregation Rules, which, subject to certain narrow exceptions, require the aggregation of all positions for which the market participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which the participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with the market participant.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such Position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in unleaded gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed unleaded gasoline futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, UGA could be liable for US.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Federal income tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, UGA may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any imputed understatement of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If UGA is required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of UGA and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Under certain circumstances, UGA may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as UGA to make this election is uncertain.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If the election is made, UGA would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment ( Adjusted K-1s ).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s are issued.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The resulting tax liability on an investor of taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the Adjusted K-1 is issued may be less favorable to the investor than if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed year.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income will be derived from (a) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory) or futures, forwards, options, swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (b) interest income, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If UGA is required to withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Under certain circumstances, UGA may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Although the LP Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, UGA may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since it does not generally expect to make any distributions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	This could have a material impact on the value of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Currently, OTC transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	A portion of UGA s assets may be used to trade OTC Gasoline Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	OTC contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The markets for OTC contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	While certain regulations adopted over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the OTC market, complying with such regulations could have substantial and adverse effects on UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Business Regulation for a discussion of how the OTC market will be subject to much more extensive regulatory oversight.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its unleaded gasoline production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA's Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The large size of the positions that UGA may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	OTC contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	UGA is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	UGA is not actively managed by conventional methods.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Accordingly, if UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests are declining in value, UGA will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	USCF will seek to cause the NAV of UGA s shares to track the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in UGA s shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	UGA s shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of UGA s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In the event that one or more Authorized Participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors incurring a loss on their investment.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets, and the conditions associated with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors investment in the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Only Authorized Participants may create or redeem Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	All other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through the NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the shares may be traded.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV per share.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The lack of an active trading market for UGA s shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in UGA at the time the investor sells the shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Although UGA s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Under Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for UGA s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	A limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of UGA s shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, a limited partner may be required to repay to UGA any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Under Delaware law, UGA may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes UGA s liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of UGA s assets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The LLC Agreement provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF s parent company, which is wholly owned by Concierge, a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by Nicholas Gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	USCF s Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, each of whom are executive officers or employees of USCF, and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Under USCF s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company s Board of Directors.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In addition, any Director may be removed by written consent of Wainwright Holdings, Inc.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P79_S3	( Wainwright ), which is the sole member of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The sole shareholder of Wainwright is Concierge Technologies Inc., a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol CNCG ( Concierge ).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Mr. Nicholas Gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders, owns the majority of the shares in Concierge, which is the sole shareholder of Wainwright, the sole member of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his indirect control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and UGA, including their regulatory obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, and OTC spreads and extraordinary expenses ( e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Business Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA's performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on unleaded gasoline prices and unleaded gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA's investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of unleaded gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Trading on such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, UGA is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P98_S4	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	UGA is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA and also are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P100_S2	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P100_S3	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with UGA have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of UGA and the shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	UGA may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the FCM, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P102_S2	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P102_S3	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P104_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P104_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P104_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P106_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if the investor will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Nonetheless, although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g. , at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P106_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on UGA s net asset value.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The SEC adopted Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 on July 23, 2014, which became effective on October 14, 2016, to reform money market funds ( MMFs ).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	While the new rule applies only to MMFs, it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S2	The new rule requires institutional prime MMFs to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a floating net asset value per share or floating NAV ).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized cost method to value their portfolio securities.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S4	Additionally, liquidity fees and gates allowing an MMF s board of directors to directly address runs on a fund.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S5	MMFs boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates (temporary suspension of redemptions).
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P109_S6	The fees and gates could be imposed on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government MMFs.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	UGA currently invests in government MMFs, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	UGA does not hold any non-government MMFs and, currently, does not anticipate investing in any non-government MMFs.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P110_S2	The new rule further decreases the likelihood that UGA would invest in any non-governmental MMFs.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P110_S3	However, if UGA were to make investments in non-government MMFs in the future, such investments could negatively impact UGA because of the changes to MMFs resulting from the new rule.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a clearing broker or an Exchange s clearing house, UGA could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P112_S1	If such a bankruptcy were to occur, UGA would be afforded the protections granted to customers of a futures commission merchant, or FCM, and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable CFTC regulations.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P112_S3	In any case, there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing UGA to recover all, or even any, of the amounts it has deposited as margin.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Bankruptcy of a clearing FCM can be caused by, among other things, the default of one of the FCM s customers.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P113_S1	In this event, the Exchange s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by UGA (as well as margin posted by other customers of the FCM) to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Consequently, UGA could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its futures positions, including assets posted as margin, and could sustain substantial losses.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	On January 13, 2014, new regulations became effective relating to enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and 20 examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	There can be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, UGA or its investors.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Notwithstanding that UGA could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its FCM, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P117_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	It is possible that third parties might utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P119_S1	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P120_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Due to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, UGA is susceptible to operational and information security risks.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P122_S1	In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P122_S3	Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P122_S4	Cyber security failures or breaches of UGA s clearing broker or third party service provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of UGA shareholders to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P123_S1	UGA and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.
1396878_17_ITEM1A_P124_S0	While UGA has established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such plans.
1396878_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	UGA s shares have traded on the NYSE Arca under the symbol UGA since November 25, 2008.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to trading on the NYSE Arca, UGA s shares traded on the AMEX under the symbol UGA since its initial public offering on February 26, 2008.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth the range of reported high and low sales prices of the shares as reported on the AMEX and NYSE Arca, as applicable, for the periods indicated below.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA had approximately 13,915 holders of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	UGA has not made and does not currently intend to make cash distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	UGA does not purchase shares directly from its shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	In connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Participants, UGA redeemed 7 baskets (comprising 350,000 shares) and 31 baskets (comprising 1,550,000 shares) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
1396878_17_ITEM5_P3_S2	Monthly redemptions for the last three months are detailed below.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UGA s NAV for any period 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percentage (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2016 and exhibited an uptrend through early June and an upward trend for the remainder of the year.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $1.271 per gallon.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Prices hit a peak on December 29, 2016 of $1.680 per gallon.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	The low for the year was on February 9, 2016, when the prices dropped to $0.899 per gallon.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.671 per gallon, up approximately 31.46% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	UGA s per share NAV began the year at $29.30 and ended the year at $31.37 on December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 7.06% over the year.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	UGA s per share NAV reached its high for the year on December 29, 2016 at $31.54 and reached its low for the year on February 9, 2016 at $20.22.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2016 contract and ended with the February 2017 contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase of approximately 31.46% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA s Benchmark.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the gasoline futures market exhibited periods of both contango and backwardation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	On days when the market was in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract was typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The per share NAV of UGA s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 300,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s shares ceased trading on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2016, UGA had issued 12,900,000 shares, 2,250,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	As of December 31, 2016, there were 67,100,000 shares registered but not yet issued.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	More shares may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The increase in the per share NAV for December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of higher prices for unleaded gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline futures contracts in which UGA held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014, was primarily a result of lower prices for unleaded gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the unleaded gasoline futures contracts in which UGA held and traded.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015; for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended 2014 average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA were similar.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to year ended 2015 and similar during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended 2014.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in total fees and expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to UGA s larger size as measured by total net assets; and the increase in total fees and expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended December 31, 2014, was due to an increase in variable total fees and expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of increased brokerage fees due to a higher number of gasoline futures contracts held and traded; and the increase for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, was primarily a result of increased brokerage fees due to higher number of unleaded gasoline futures contracts held and traded.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to higher prices for unleaded gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline futures contracts in which UGA held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to lower prices for unleaded gasoline and the related decrease in the value of the unleaded gasoline futures contracts in which UGA held and traded.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015; and for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended 2014 average interest rates on short-term investments held by UGA were higher.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015 and higher during the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015 was due to UGA s larger size as measured by total net assets; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, was due to an increase in variable total fees and expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of increased brokerage fees due to a higher number of unleaded gasoline futures contracts held and traded; and the increase for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, was primarily a result of increased brokerage fees due to a higher number of unleaded gasoline futures contracts held and traded.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30 valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in gasoline Futures Contracts, other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	For the 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2016, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.7613%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.7596%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The average daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (1.647)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2015, the last trading day in December.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Since December 2009 to December 31, 2016, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.007%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.006%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The average daily difference was (0.001)% (or (0.1) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.873)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 7.06%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $29.30 on December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $31.37.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $31.50 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of 7.51%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 7.06% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 7.51% was an error over the time period of (0.45)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (13.57)%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $33.90 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $29.30.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $29.50 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of (12.98)%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (13.57)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (12.98)% was an error over the time period of 0.59%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return outperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The impact of these expenses tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (43.40)%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $59.89 on December 31, 2013 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2014 of $33.90.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $34.16 as of December 31, 2014, for a total return over the relevant time period of (42.96)%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (43.40)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (42.96)% was an error over the time period of (0.44)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The impact of these expenses tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2016, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Second, UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	At the same time, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	One factor arises from rolling futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near or front month contract) forward each month prior to expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery, is $1.50 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also $1.50.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Over time, the price of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical gallons of gasoline, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Contango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of UGA s shares and changes in the spot prices of gasoline will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g. , when the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $1.47 per gallon, or 2% cheaper than the $1.50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.47 next month futures contract would rise to $1.50 as it approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of gasoline may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P48_S5	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	If the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $1.50 per gallon, the price of the next month futures contract might be $1.53 per gallon, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the $1.53 next month futures contract would fall to $1.50 as it approaches expiration.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of gasoline may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P49_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The chart below compares the daily price of the near month gasoline futures contract to the price of 13th month gasoline futures contract (i.e. a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13 th month futures contract prices (contango).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	An alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13th month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract, as shown in the chart below.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	When the difference is negative, the market is in contango.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	The gasoline market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10 year period between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	For example, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2015 and held to December 31, 2016 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 7.06%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 31.46% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2014 and held to December 31, 2015 decreased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately (13.57)%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period decreased by (13.66)% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was primarily impacted by the excess supply of crude oil, the input product for gasoline, which resulted in lower prices in the United States.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract began 2016 at $1.271 per gallon.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	Prices hit a peak on December 29, 2016 of $1.680 per gallon after falling for most of the year.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	The low for the year was on February 9, 2016, when the price dropped to $0.899 per gallon.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.671 per gallon, up approximately 31.46% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) decision in late 2014 to maintain production levels despite falling demand led to an oversupplied market.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	The amount of crude in storage in the U.S. increased consistently from the start of the year to late April before beginning to decline on moderately reduced output from shale producers and other sources.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	However, storage remained elevated relative to previous levels and began to rise again in late summer, approaching the peak level of 512 million barrels reported in April, the highest volume since the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) began reporting storage data in 1982.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	U.S. crude oil inventories fell to approximately 479 million barrels by the end of December, approximately 6.21% higher than the same week a year earlier Prices fluctuated as investors weighed the possibility that global inventories may stabilize in 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Should supply continue to grow or should the global economic situation decline, there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could fall further, while disruptions due to conflict in the Middle East would likely have the opposite effect.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	For the ten-year time period between 2006 and 2016, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of gasoline on a monthly basis was strongly correlated with crude oil and diesel-heating oil, somewhat correlated with large cap U.S. equities and global equities, uncorrelated with natural gas, and somewhat negatively correlated with U.S. government bonds.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2016, gasoline was strongly correlated to movements in crude oil and diesel-heating oil, somewhat correlated with large cap U.S. equities, global equities and natural gas, and somewhat inversely correlated with U.S. government bonds.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at its custodian bank and in investments in bank Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S7	Similarly, during the year ended December 31, 2015, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S8	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, UGA used other assets to pay cash expenses, which could cause a decrease in UGA s NAV over time.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P70_S9	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P71_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Prior to the initial offering of UGA, all payments with respect to UGA s expenses were paid by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	UGA does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	USCF is under no obligation to pay UGA s current or future expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	Since the initial offering of shares, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P72_S4	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P73_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	UGA is not currently a member of any clearinghouse.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	An FCM, when acting on behalf of UGA in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	In the future, UGA may purchase OTC swaps, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of OTC swaps.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $66,497,093 with the custodian and FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian or FCM, as applicable, cease operations.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	UGA had no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of December 31, 2016 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to an FCM), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Commission payments to an FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of December 31, 2016, UGA s portfolio consisted of 1,006 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	As of December 31, 2016, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on exchanges other than NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Currently, OTC transactions are subject to changing regulation.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	UGA may purchase OTC contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions) in the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s board of directors (the Board ).
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and /or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P8_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_17_ITEM7A_P11_S2	OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2016, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	The Fund s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P4_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, of the Fund and our report dated March 10, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	* Collateral amounted to $2,277,668 on open futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	* Collateral amounted to $11,076,293 on open futures contracts.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its per share NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments primarily in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2016, UGA held 1,006 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	UGA commenced investment operations on February 26, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, UGA is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any tax related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in UGA recording a tax liability that reduces net assets.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P39_S4	However, UGA s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Profit or loss shall be allocated among the partners of UGA in proportion to the number of shares each partner holds as of the close of each month.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	USCF may revise, alter or otherwise modify this method of allocation as described in the LP Agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Net income (loss) per share is the difference between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The weighted average number of shares outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average share.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	The weighted average shares are equal to the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for shares added and redeemed based on the amount of time the shares were outstanding during such period.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	There were no shares held by USCF at December 31, 2016.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Offering costs incurred in connection with the registration of additional shares after the initial registration of shares are borne by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	These costs include registration fees paid to regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offerings.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	These costs are accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter period if warranted.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Cash equivalents include money market funds and overnight deposits or time deposits with original maturity dates of six months or less.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Certain amounts in the accompanying financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires USCF to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Under the LP Agreement, USCF is responsible for investing the assets of UGA in accordance with the objectives and policies of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	In addition, USCF has arranged for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custody, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to UGA.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	These costs include registration or other fees paid to regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offer and sale.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, UGA incurred $46,581, $46,453 and $46,454, respectively, in registration fees and other offering expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance for UGA and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	UGA shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $582,050 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P53_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2014, these fees and expenses were $567,863 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P53_S7	UGA s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $12,396.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	As discussed in Note 4 below, UGA entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee that is equal to 0.015% on all net assets.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, UGA incurred $11,052, $12,365 and $7,357, respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	These costs were approximately $178,000, $164,000 and $164,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	Tax report costs fluctuate between years due to the number of shareholders during any given year.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	In addition to the fees described above, UGA pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UGA, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as outlined in Note 4 below.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	USCF paid certain expenses typically borne by UGA on a discretionary basis where expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016, USCF waived $269,909 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 Contracts and Agreements below.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion; and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution related services exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of UGA s offering.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The above fee does not include website construction and development, which are also borne by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	UGA is also party to a custodian agreement, dated January 16, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman Co. ( BBH Co. ) and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of the Related Public Funds combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for the Related Public Funds combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once the Related Public Funds combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P60_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P60_S4	USCF also pays BBH Co. transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	On October 8, 2013, UGA entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The agreement with RBC requires it to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	In accordance with the agreement, RBC Capital charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $8 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers was due primarily to a larger number of futures contracts held and traded during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to a larger number of futures contracts held and traded.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	UGA may engage in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Cleared swaps are agreements that are eligible to be cleared by a clearinghouse, e.g., ICE Clear Europe, and provide the efficiencies and benefits that centralized clearing on an exchange offers to traders of futures contracts, including credit risk intermediation and the ability to offset positions initiated with different counterparties.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps require margin deposits with an FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Buying and selling options on futures contracts exposes investors to the risks of purchasing or selling futures contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA through December 31, 2016 were exchange-traded.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with OTC swaps since, in OTC swaps, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P74_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the FCM s segregation requirements.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	The insolvency of an FCM could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that FCM; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of an FCM.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P76_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following table presents per share performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2016 using the fair value hierarchy:

1396878_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2015 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	ASU 2015-14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.

1396878_17_ITEM8_P102_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P102_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1396878_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1396878_17_ITEM10_P39_S0	Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of UGA are not compensated by UGA, but instead by USCF, UGA does not have a compensation committee.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P39_S1	Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P40_S0	USCF believes that it is necessary for each member of the Board to possess many qualities and skills.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P40_S1	USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P41_S0	When vacancies in USCF s Board occur, the members of the Board consider a candidate s management experience as well as his/her background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity and ethics.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P41_S1	In connection with this, the Board also considers issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and skills.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P41_S2	The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board believes that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P42_S0	The Board of USCF has adopted a Corporate Governance Policy that applies to UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P42_S1	UGA has posted the text of the Corporate Governance Policy on its website at www.uscfinvestments.com.

1396878_17_ITEM10_P43_S2	Any shareholder of UGA may also obtain a printed copy of the Code of Ethics, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259.

1396878_17_ITEM10_P44_S0	In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy of USCF, the non-management directors of the Board (who are the same as the independent directors of the Board) meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions, without the presence of Management Directors or executive officers of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P44_S1	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis to preside over each such executive session.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P44_S2	Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Ellis by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P45_S0	The Board of USCF is led by a Chairman, Nicholas Gerber, Mr. John P. Love separately serves as USCF s President and Chief Executive Officer.

1396878_17_ITEM10_P45_S2	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis as the presiding independent director.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P45_S3	Mr. Ellis role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P46_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF as founder of USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P46_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading discussions and execution of new strategic objectives while facilitating information flow between USCF and the full Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P46_S2	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P46_S3	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as OTC swap contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P47_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P48_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P49_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P49_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in OTC swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P49_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P49_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including OTC swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P49_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any OTC swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P50_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P51_S0	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires directors and executive officers of USCF and persons who are beneficial owners of at least 10% of UGA s shares to file with the SEC an Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 3 within 10 calendar days of first becoming a director, executive officer or beneficial owner of at least 10% of UGA s shares and a Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 4 within 2 business days of a subsequent acquisition or disposition of shares of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM10_P51_S1	To UGA s knowledge, based upon a review of copies of reports furnished to it with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and upon the written representations of the directors and executive officers of USCF, all of such persons have filed all required reports.
1396878_17_ITEM11_P0_S0	UGA does not directly compensate any of the executive officers noted above.
1396878_17_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.
1396878_17_ITEM11_P0_S3	UGA pays fees to USCF pursuant to the LP Agreement under which it is obligated to pay USCF an annualized fee of 0.60% of its average daily net assets.

1396878_17_ITEM11_P1_S1	UGA s portion of the aggregate fees paid to the directors for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4,861.

1396878_17_ITEM12_P0_S0	None of the directors or executive officers of USCF, nor the employees of UGA own any shares of UGA.
1396878_17_ITEM12_P0_S1	In addition, UGA is not aware of any 5% holder of its shares.
1396878_17_ITEM13_P0_S0	UGA has and will continue to have certain relationships with USCF and its affiliates.

1396878_17_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2016, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_17_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_17_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
1396878_17_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees consist of fees paid to Spicer Jeffries LLP for (i) the audit of UGA s annual financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and certain of UGA s current reports on Form 8-K; (ii) the audit of UGA s internal control over financial reporting included in the annual report on Form 10-K; and (iii) services that are normally provided by the Independent Registered Public Accountants in connection with statutory and regulatory filings of registration statements.

1396878_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) is a Delaware limited partnership organized on April 13, 2007.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	UGA maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests ( shares ) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	It is not the intent of UGA to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its per share NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.

1396878_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UGA s outstanding shares (excluding shares owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	UGA has no executive officers or employees.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the LP Agreement, UGA s affairs are managed by USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board ), which is comprised of four management directors (the Management Directors ), each of whom are also executive officers or employees of USCF, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

1396878_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Audit Committee in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in gasoline prices.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the gasoline market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Gasoline Interests in this annual report on Form 10-K. UGA invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	The daily holdings of UGA are available on UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract on gasoline (also known as RBOB, for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	UGA s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	UGA may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contract to comply with accountability levels and position limits.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see Item 1.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	UGA s neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UGA s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in gasoline in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the gasoline or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their gasoline-related transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in gasoline and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	In addition, an investment in UGA involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of gasoline, in percentage terms.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	On that day, USCF closes or sells UGA s Gasoline Interests and also reinvests or rolls in new Gasoline Interests.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The anticipated dates on which the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be changed and UGA s Gasoline Interests will be rolled are posted on UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com, and are subject to change without notice.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	UGA s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Gasoline Interest, the specific types of Other Gasoline-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Gasoline-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UGA s portfolio.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	UGA s website is publicly accessible at no charge.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	UGA s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ) and CFTC regulations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	The shares issued by UGA may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Creation Baskets .
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called Redemption Baskets .
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	The purchase price for Creation Baskets and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	While UGA issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	In managing UGA s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Gasoline Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of gasoline for delivery to the New York harbor.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares traded on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, have closely tracked and will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline, on a percentage basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P34_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	USCF endeavors to place UGA s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and otherwise manage UGA s investments so that A will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of B , where:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UGA s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in UGA s per share NAV on a percentage basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	USCF further believes that daily changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically closely tracked the daily changes in spot prices of gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of UGA s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track, the daily changes in the spot price of gasoline on a percentage basis, plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	For performance data relating to UGA s ability to track its benchmark, see Item 7.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P37_S4	Tracking UGA s Benchmark in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UGA s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UGA s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	To the extent that UGA invests in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contract, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the OTC market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	If UGA is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Benchmark Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UGA s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S4	As UGA s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Gasoline-Related Investments at such higher levels.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P38_S5	In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UGA to invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments include those allowing UGA to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Business Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UGA s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	USCF may not be able to fully invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UGA s NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UGA s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	As a result, in such circumstances, UGA may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract through the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	UGA anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on gasoline (such as futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	USCF does not anticipate letting UGA s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g., when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contract or Other Gasoline-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	UGA may purchase Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX that are based on gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	The ICE Futures also offers an RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	The RBOB Gasoline Futures Contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for RBOB gasoline in the New York harbor.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	It may also purchase contracts on other exchanges, including the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange and other U.S. and foreign exchanges.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) also affect supply and prices.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest cut from oil after gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	The ICE Futures also offers a diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 10,000 million British thermal units and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The price of natural gas has historically been volatile.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Futures contracts are agreements between two parties.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	One party agrees to buy a commodity such as gasoline from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	For example, the Benchmark Futures Contract is traded on the NYMEX in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits .
1396878_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that UGA invests in to meet its investment objective.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The current accountability level for investments for any one month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its gasoline contract as the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	If UGA and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for gasoline, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UGA could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA held 637 NYMEX RBOB Gasoline Futures RB contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2017, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA did not exceed accountability levels on the NYMEX or ICE Futures.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	It is unlikely that UGA will run up against such position limits because of UGA s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract to expire during one day each month.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA did not exceed position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P61_S5	See The Commodity Interest Markets-Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required, subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that participant (the Aggregation Rules ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such Position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for gasoline are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by gasoline futures traders throughout the day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	Because UGA invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UGA, and therefore the prices of UGA shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	Therefore, if UGA s futures positions have declined in value, UGA may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Alternatively, if UGA futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UGA s account.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	UGA seeks to have its aggregate NAV approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the Futures Contracts (or Other Gasoline-Related Investments) it holds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UGA s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a notional value of $10 million would not require UGA to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UGA would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9 million (assuming a 10% margin).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UGA s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with an FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UGA may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its OTC contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	UGA earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	UGA anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners capital contribution accounts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	UGA reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P70_S3	If UGA reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	UGA invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Gasoline-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	While the gasoline Futures Contracts traded can be physically settled, UGA does not intend to take or make physical delivery.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	UGA may from time to time trade in Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	USCF endeavors to have the value of UGA s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UGA or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s (or other commodity interest s) entire market value.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UGA s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Borrowings are not used by UGA unless UGA is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UGA trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the gasoline market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	Consequently, UGA may purchase options on gasoline Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e., the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	UGA may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	UGA would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	UGA has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	In its capacity as the Custodian for UGA, BBH Co. may hold UGA s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	BBH Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UGA, BBH Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UGA and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	USCF pays BBH Co. s fees for these services.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	BBH Co. s principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110-1548.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	BBH Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	BBH Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law 160 181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	BBH Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	UGA also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	ALPS Distributors principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	On October 8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital ) to serve as UGA s FCM, effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to UGA, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	For the period October 10, 2013 and after, UGA pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	RBC Capital s primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Effective October 10, 2013, RBC Capital became the futures clearing broker for UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC ), and its subsidiary, RBC Capital Markets LLC ( RBC Capital ), are large financial institutions subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	As a result, certain of RBC s regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect to issues raised in various investigations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P91_S3	In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P91_S4	RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	RBC has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	RBC is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC s business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	RBC contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	On April 27, 2017, pursuant to an offer of settlement, a Panel of the Chicago Board of Trade Business Conduct Committee ( Panel ) found that RBC Capital engaged in EFRP transactions which failed to satisfy the Rules of the Chicago Board of Trade (the Exchange ) in one or more ways.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P94_S1	Specifically, the Panel found that RBC Capital traders entered into EFRP trades in which RBC Capital accounts were on both sides of the transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P94_S2	While the purpose of the transactions was to transfer positions between the RBC Capital accounts, the CME Group found that the manner in which the trades occurred violated the Exchange s prohibition on wash trades.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P94_S3	The Panel found that RBC Capital thereby violated CBOT Rules 534 and (legacy) 538.B. and C. In accordance with the settlement offer, the Panel ordered RBC Capital to pay a $175,000 fine.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	On June 18, 2015, in connection with the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation initiative of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the SEC commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	RBC Capital paid a fine of $500,000.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	RBC and certain affiliates were named as defendants in a lawsuit relating to their role in transactions involving investments made by a number of Wisconsin school districts in certain collateralized debt obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	These transactions were also the subject of a regulatory investigation, which was resolved in 2011.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	RBC reached a final settlement with all parties in the civil litigation, and the civil action against RBC was dismissed with prejudice on December 6, 2016.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	On July 31, 2015, RBC Capital was added as a new defendant in a pending putative class action initially filed in November 2013 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	The action is brought against multiple foreign exchange dealers and alleges collusive behavior, among other allegations, in foreign exchange trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	Various regulators are also conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of law by a number of banks and other entities, including RBC, regarding foreign exchange trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P97_S3	In September 2017, the U.S. District Court entered an order preliminarily approving a pending settlement with class plaintiffs.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P97_S4	Canadian class actions and one other U.S. action that is purportedly brought on behalf of different classes of plaintiffs remain pending.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	On April 13, 2015, RBC s affiliate, Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas), was charged in France with complicity in tax fraud.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P98_S2	The trial of this matter has concluded and a verdict was delivered on January 12, 2017, acquitting the company and the other defendants.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P98_S3	The French prosecutor s office has appealed.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Thornburg Mortgage Inc. (now known as TMST ) and RBC were parties to a master repurchase agreement executed in September 2003 whereby TMST financed its purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	Upon TMST s default during the financial crisis, RBC valued TMST s collateral at allegedly deflated prices.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	After TMST s bankruptcy filing, TMST s trustee brought suit against RBC in 2011 for breach of contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P99_S3	In 2015, TMST was awarded more than $45 million in damages.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	The appeals court set a briefing schedule and simultaneously ordered the parties to participate in a mediation.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	The parties have subsequently reached an agreement to settle the matter; a motion to approve the settlement was filed with the bankruptcy court on January 10, 2016 and granted on February 27, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	On October 14, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery ) in a class action brought by former shareholders of Rural/Metro Corporation, held RBC Capital liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by three Rural/Metro directors, but did not make an additional award for attorney s fees.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	A final judgment was entered on February 19, 2015 in the amount of US$93 million plus post judgment interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S2	RBC appealed the Court of Chancery s determination of liability and quantum of damages, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed the ruling on additional attorneys fees.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S3	On November 30, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Chancery with respect to both the appeal and cross-appeal.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S4	RBC is cooperating with an investigation by the SEC relating to this matter.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S5	In particular, the SEC contended that RBC caused materially false and misleading information to be included in the proxy statement that Rural filed to solicit shareholder approval for the sale in violation of section 14(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14A-9 thereunder.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P101_S6	On August 31, 2016, RBC was ordered by the SEC to cease and desist and paid $500,000 in disgorgement, plus interest of $77,759 and a civil penalty of $2 million.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	On March 11, 2013, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which alleged that RBC failed to follow its own procedures with respect to monthly account reviews and failed to maintain copies of the monthly account reviews with respect to certain accounts that James Hankins Jr. maintained at the firm in violation of N.J.S.A. 49:3-58(a)(2)(xi) and 49:3-59(b).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	Without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, RBC consented to a civil monetary penalty of $150,000 (of which $100,000 was suspended as a result of the firm s cooperation) and to pay disgorgement of $300,000.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	Please see RBC's Form BD, which is available on the FINRA BrokerCheck program, for more details.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	RBC will act only as clearing broker for UGA and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	RBC has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K. RBC will not act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF or participate in the management of USCF or UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	RBC is not affiliated with UGA or USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	Therefore, neither USCF nor UGA believes that there are any conflicts of interest with RBC or its trading principals arising from its acting as UGA s FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	Currently, USCF does not employ commodity trading advisors for the trading of UGA contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	USCF currently does, however, employ SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC as a trading advisor for USCI, CPER and USAG.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	If, in the future, USCF does employ commodity trading advisors for UGA, it will choose each advisor based on arm s-length negotiations and will consider the advisor s experience, fees and reputation.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	Minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to all funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P107_S1	In addition, an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of UGA s and the Related Public Funds combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for UGA s and the Related Public Funds combined net assets greater than $500 million but less than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once UGA s and the Related Public Funds combined net assets exceed $1 billion.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	(2) The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	USCF also will pay transaction charge fees to BBH Co., ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction for the funds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	UGA is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on 0.60% per annum on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of total net assets on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	Total net assets are calculated by taking the current market value of UGA s total assets and subtracting any liabilities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	(4) Fees are calculated on a daily basis (accrued at 1/365 of the applicable percentage of NAV on that day) and paid on a monthly basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	UGA is responsible for its pro rata share of the assets held by UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG, USOU and USOD.

1396878_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	(6) USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P116_S1	USCF has no obligation to pay such expenses in subsequent periods.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Expenses Paid or Accrued by UGA from Inception through December 31, 2017 as a Percentage of Average Daily Net Assets:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	Amount Paid or Accrued to USCF:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	Amount Paid or Accrued in Portfolio Brokerage Commissions:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	Other Amounts Paid or Accrued (7) :

1396878_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	(7) Includes expenses relating to the registration of additional shares, legal fees, auditing fees, printing expenses, licensing fees, tax reporting fees, prepaid insurance expenses and miscellaneous expenses and fees and expenses paid to the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	(8) USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA, to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P123_S1	USCF has no obligation to pay such expenses in subsequent periods.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its audit expenses, tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S1	These fees were approximately $186,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S2	In addition, UGA is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance for UGA and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UGA and the Related Public Funds organized as limited partnerships and, as of July 8, 2011, those Related Public Funds organized as a series of a Delaware statutory trust.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S3	UGA shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S4	These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $536,375 for UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P124_S5	UGA s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8,185.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P125_S1	The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P125_S2	The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P125_S3	USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P125_S4	The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P126_S2	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies ( DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant ( Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P127_S2	Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	DTC has advised UGA as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated by:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of UGA once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH Co., UGA and USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S4	Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UGA in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S5	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P132_S6	Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UGA for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of UGA as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the Futures Contracts on the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P133_S2	The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P133_S3	In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contract, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UGA s investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	New York time to 4:00 p.m.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S2	The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S3	New York time to 2:30 p.m.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S4	This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UGA s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for gasoline Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S5	During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX immediately preceding trading session.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S6	In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UGA will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P135_S7	These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UGA shares on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P137_S1	Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P137_S2	If the market price of UGA shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P137_S3	For example, if UGA appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UGA shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short gasoline Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P137_S4	Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UGA and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P138_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P139_S1	Authorized Participants must be: (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P139_S2	To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of UGA (each such agreement, an Authorized Participant Agreement ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P139_S3	The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P139_S4	The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UGA, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	Authorized Participants pay UGA a transaction fee of $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P140_S2	As of December 31, 2017, 12 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P140_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA issued 23 Creation Baskets and redeemed 38 Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical gasoline market and the gasoline futures market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P141_S1	In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy gasoline or sell gasoline or Gasoline Interests and may profit in these instances.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P141_S2	USCF believes that the size and operation of the gasoline market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant s direct activities in the gasoline or securities markets will significantly affect the price of gasoline, Gasoline Interests, or the price of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P142_S1	Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P142_S2	Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and UGA under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P145_S1	For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P145_S2	Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P147_S1	Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P147_S2	Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P148_S1	By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P148_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant s purchase of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	The total deposit required to create each basket ( Creation Basket Deposit ) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P150_S1	USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P150_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UGA s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the second business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account on the second business day following the purchase order date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UGA shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P153_S1	UGA s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P157_S1	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P157_S2	Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P157_S3	A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P157_S4	The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA, as described below.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to UGA s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P158_S2	An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to UGA s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order ( Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UGA for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P159_S2	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P159_S3	The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UGA s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant s sale of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	The redemption distribution from UGA consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UGA (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P160_S1	USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P160_S2	The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	The redemption distribution due from UGA will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such second business day, UGA s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P161_S1	If UGA s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P161_S2	Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UGA receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P161_S3	Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P161_S4	Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UGA s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P162_S1	For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UGA s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P162_S2	If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an OTC contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P162_S3	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P163_S1	USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P163_S2	USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares (i.e., two baskets) or less.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	To compensate UGA for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P164_S1	Authorized Participants pay UGA a transaction fee of $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P164_S2	The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P164_S3	USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and UGA if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	As noted, UGA creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P166_S1	The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UGA or the distribution by UGA of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S2	An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S3	Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the per share NAV of UGA at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S4	The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between UGA s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P167_S5	Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P168_S0	An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P168_S1	Authorized Participants who make deposits with UGA in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UGA or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UGA to effect any sale or resale of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P169_S0	Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P169_S1	Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P169_S2	The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P169_S3	While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P169_S4	As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P170_S0	USCF causes UGA to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P170_S1	USCF will invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P171_S0	When UGA purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Gasoline-Related Investments, UGA is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Gasoline Interests at maturity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P171_S1	This deposit is known as initial margin.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P171_S2	Counterparties in transactions in OTC Gasoline Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P171_S3	USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P171_S4	USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:
1396878_18_ITEM1_P172_S0	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests based on changes in the value of the Gasoline Interests.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P173_S1	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Gasoline Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Gasoline Interest, and each party s creditworthiness.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P174_S0	In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Gasoline Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UGA s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P174_S1	The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UGA will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P174_S2	All interest income will be used for UGA s benefit.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P175_S0	An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UGA to hold trading positions at any time.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P175_S1	Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P176_S0	The assets of UGA posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P177_S0	If UGA enters into a swap agreement, UGA must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P177_S1	The amount of collateral UGA posts changes according to the amounts owed by UGA to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by UGA at the start of a swap transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P177_S2	Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P178_S0	The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P178_S1	The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded (e.g., contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (e.g., retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P179_S0	The offer and sale of shares of UGA, as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P180_S0	UGA and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P180_S1	Firms participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P182_S1	The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P182_S2	Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P183_S0	In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P183_S1	Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P183_S2	The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S0	A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S1	Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S2	Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S3	Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S4	If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S5	Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P184_S6	Nevertheless, in some instances forward contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P185_S0	In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UGA or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P185_S1	Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P186_S0	Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P186_S1	The exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P187_S0	While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P187_S1	The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P187_S2	Trading in the interbank market also exposes UGA to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UGA had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P188_S0	Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P188_S1	An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P188_S2	The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P189_S0	The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P189_S1	The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P189_S2	The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P190_S0	A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P190_S1	Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P191_S0	Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P191_S1	Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P192_S0	The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P192_S1	As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P192_S2	An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P192_S3	On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P193_S0	Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P193_S1	The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P193_S2	Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P193_S3	For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P193_S4	Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller typically posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P194_S0	Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P195_S0	An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P195_S1	However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P195_S2	Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P196_S0	Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P196_S1	Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P197_S0	Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P197_S1	Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P197_S2	Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P198_S0	In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P198_S1	If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P199_S0	Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P200_S0	Clearing refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member (i.e., an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P200_S1	These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P200_S2	Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is terminated and replaced by two mirror trades for which the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P200_S3	In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P201_S0	Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P201_S1	Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P202_S0	The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P202_S1	The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P202_S2	In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P203_S0	The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P204_S0	Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P204_S1	The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P204_S2	Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UGA or the Related Public Funds.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P205_S0	Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P205_S1	Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P206_S0	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P206_S1	The NFA is the only self-regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P206_S2	As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P207_S0	The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operators.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P207_S1	USCF is a member of the NFA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P207_S2	As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P208_S0	The CEA requires all FCMs, i.e., UGA s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P209_S0	The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P209_S1	The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P210_S0	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P210_S1	The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P210_S2	Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P211_S0	CFTC regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P211_S1	These regulations are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P212_S0	UGA s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P212_S1	Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P213_S0	The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO and their respective associated persons.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P214_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P214_S1	Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P214_S2	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P214_S3	In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P215_S0	The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P215_S1	The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P215_S2	These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S0	As discussed above, the CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P216_S5	See The Commodity Interest Markets-Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P217_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P217_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P217_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P218_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required, subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that participant.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P218_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such Position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P219_S0	Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P219_S1	Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P220_S0	A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P220_S1	It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P221_S0	Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P221_S1	Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P221_S2	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P221_S3	In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P222_S0	Brokerage firms, such as UGA s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P222_S1	The clearing brokers require UGA to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P222_S2	This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P223_S0	Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader s clearing broker.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P223_S1	When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P223_S2	With respect to trading by UGA, UGA (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P224_S0	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P225_S0	When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P225_S1	When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P225_S2	The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P226_S0	Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P227_S0	In October 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies ) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants ( Swap Entities ) that are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities , and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules ).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P228_S0	The Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities, and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Final Margin Rules), to a mandatory two-way minimum initial margin requirement.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P228_S1	The minimum amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that is approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P228_S2	The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with financial end users (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P229_S0	The Final Margin Rules require minimum variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user).
1396878_18_ITEM1_P229_S1	The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously posted or collected.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P229_S2	For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be posted or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P229_S3	Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P230_S0	The initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules are being phased in over time, and the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules are currently in effect.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P231_S0	UGA is not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules but it is a financial end-user.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P231_S1	Accordingly, UGA is currently subject to the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P231_S2	However, UGA does not have material swaps exposure and, accordingly, UGA will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P232_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required the CFTC and the SEC to adopt their own margin rules to apply to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P232_S1	On December 16, 2015, the CFTC finalized its margin rules, which are substantially the same as the Final Margin Rules and have the same implementation timeline.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P232_S2	The SEC has yet to finalize its margin rules.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P233_S0	CFTC regulations require that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations ( derivative clearing organizations ( DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular class of swap and such swap is made available to trade on a swap execution facility.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P233_S1	Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P233_S2	As a result, if UGA enters into an interest rate or index-based credit default swaps that is subject to these requirements, such swap will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P233_S3	Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UGA to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P234_S0	If a swap is required to be cleared, initial and variation margin requirements are set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P234_S1	Additional margin may be required and held by UGA s FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P235_S0	In addition to the margin requirements described above, swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on an SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P236_S0	In addition to U.S. laws and regulations, UGA may be subject to non-U.S. derivatives laws and regulations if it engages in futures and/or swaps transactions with non-U.S. persons.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P236_S1	For example, UGA may be impacted by European laws and regulations to the extent that it engages in futures transactions on European exchanges or derivatives transactions with European entities.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P236_S2	Other jurisdictions impose requirements applicable to futures and derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the U.S., including position limits, margin, clearing and trade execution requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P237_S0	UGA makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P237_S1	These reports are also available from the SEC through its website at: www.sec.gov.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P238_S0	UGA also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.

1396878_18_ITEM1_P242_S0	USCF has been granted two patents Nos.
1396878_18_ITEM1_P242_S1	7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and UGA s financial statements and the related notes.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	UGA s investment objective is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of unleaded gasoline, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UGA s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	UGA s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in unleaded gasoline and to hedge against movements in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	An investment in UGA involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in UGA involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The NAV of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by UGA and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The net assets of UGA consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The NAV of UGA s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of unleaded gasoline in the marketplace.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for unleaded gasoline correlates closely with general economic growth rates.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on unleaded gasoline prices.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Other factors that may affect the demand for unleaded gasoline and therefore its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for unleaded gasoline associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unleaded gasoline prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce unleaded gasoline prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Other factors impacting the gasoline market.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The supply of and demand for unleaded gasoline may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy sources.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Price Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of unleaded gasoline will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Investing in UGA s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks:
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	UGA s NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of UGA s portfolio investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the unleaded gasoline and the Benchmark Futures Contract at any point in time.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The NAV of UGA s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet, light unleaded gasoline trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global gasoline market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which unleaded gasoline is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Daily percentage changes in UGA s NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in UGA s NAV per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for unleaded gasoline, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As UGA approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, UGA may begin investing in Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, UGA is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract because the total return generated by UGA is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with UGA s trading activities, and increased by interest income from UGA s holdings of Treasury securities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract requires trading of UGA s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract and the spot price of unleaded gasoline may at times be only approximate.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative gasoline market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Futures Contract) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, and technical influences in oil futures trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Natural forces in the oil futures market known as backwardation and contango may increase UGA s tracking error and/or negatively impact total return.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The design of UGA s Benchmark Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In the event of an unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Conversely, in the event of a unleaded gasoline futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in unleaded gasoline prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of unleaded gasoline, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of UGA s per share NAV to vary significantly.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on UGA s per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UGA is not) may hold, own or control.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As discussed above, the CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UGA, but the effect may be substantial and adverse.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UGA to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	See The Commodity Interest Markets-Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas).
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	As a result, UGA may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Under existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required, subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that participant.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when such Position Limit Rules are adopted.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use UGA as a way to hedge against gasoline-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in unleaded gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	UGA has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If UGA encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed unleaded gasoline futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, if UGA exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UGA s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of UGA s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of UGA s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, UGA could be liable for US.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Federal income tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by UGA in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as UGA is in many respects uncertain.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	UGA applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge UGA s allocation methods and require UGA to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, UGA may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any imputed understatement of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If UGA is required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of UGA and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Under certain circumstances, UGA may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as UGA to make this election is uncertain.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If the election is made, UGA would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment ( Adjusted K-1s ).
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s are issued.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The resulting tax liability on an investor of taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the Adjusted K-1 is issued may be less favorable to the investor than if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed year.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	UGA could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	UGA has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, UGA will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of UGA s annual gross income will be derived from (a) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory) or futures, forwards, options, swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (b) interest income, (ii) UGA is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) UGA does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Although USCF anticipates that UGA has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	UGA has not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If the IRS were to successfully assert that UGA is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, UGA would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Taxation of UGA as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, UGA has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	UGA is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by UGA on its income.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Instead, UGA will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from UGA during the taxable year.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by UGA but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which UGA does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If UGA is required to withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Under certain circumstances, UGA may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Although the LP Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, UGA may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since it does not generally expect to make any distributions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	This could have a material impact on the value of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The impact of U.S. tax reform on UGA is uncertain.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, the bill formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ), was signed into law.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Tax Act substantially alters the U.S. federal tax system in a variety of ways, including significant changes to the taxation of business entities, the deductibility of interest expense, and the tax treatment of capital investment.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We cannot predict with certainty how any changes in the tax laws might affect the U.S. economy or the demand for and the price of commodities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	As a result, it is possible that the Tax Act, as well as any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Tax Act and any future legislation related to tax reform, could have unexpected or negative impacts on UGA and some or all of its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Shareholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	UGA will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by UGA or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	UGA faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to UGA, in which case UGA could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The two-way margining requirements imposed by U.S. regulators, discussed in Item 1.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Business Commodities Regulation , are intended to mitigate this risk.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Nevertheless, if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, UGA may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	UGA may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Certain of UGA s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its unleaded gasoline production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Because both Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments may be illiquid, UGA's Gasoline Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The large size of the positions that UGA may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	OTC contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact UGA s ability to realize the full value of such contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	UGA is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	UGA is not actively managed by conventional methods.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Accordingly, if UGA s investments in Gasoline Interests are declining in value, UGA will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	USCF will seek to cause the NAV of UGA s shares to track the Benchmark Futures Contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in UGA s shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	UGA s shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of UGA s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In the event that one or more Authorized Participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors incurring a loss on their investment.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets, and the conditions associated with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors investment in the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Only Authorized Participants may create or redeem Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	All other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through the NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the shares may be traded.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV per share.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The lack of an active trading market for UGA s shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in UGA at the time the investor sells the shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Although UGA s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Under Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for UGA s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	A limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of UGA s shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, a limited partner may be required to repay to UGA any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Under Delaware law, UGA may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes UGA s liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of UGA s assets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The LLC Agreement provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF s parent company, which is wholly owned by Concierge, a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by Nicholas Gerber along with certain other family members and certain other shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	USCF s Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, each of whom are executive officers or employees of USCF, and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Under USCF s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company s Board of Directors.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In addition, any Director may be removed by written consent of Wainwright Holdings, Inc.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	( Wainwright ), which is the sole member of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The sole shareholder of Wainwright is Concierge Technologies Inc., a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol CNCG ( Concierge ).
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Mr. Nicholas Gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders, owns the majority of the shares in Concierge, which is the sole shareholder of Wainwright, the sole member of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his indirect control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and UGA, including their regulatory obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There is a risk that UGA will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such UGA may not earn any profit.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	UGA pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, and OTC spreads and extraordinary expenses (e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on UGA s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether UGA s activities are profitable.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Accordingly, UGA must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The effect of any future regulatory change on UGA is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on UGA, please see Item 1.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Business Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	An investment in UGA may provide little or no diversification benefits.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Thus, in a declining market, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in UGA while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	If, contrary to historic patterns, UGA's performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in UGA s shares.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In such a case, UGA may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in UGA at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on unleaded gasoline prices and unleaded gasoline-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject UGA's investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of unleaded gasoline and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	In the absence of negative correlation, UGA cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	UGA is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	UGA is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Trading in international markets could expose UGA to credit and regulatory risk.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	UGA invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	However, a portion of UGA s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Trading on such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, UGA is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P99_S4	An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	UGA and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	UGA is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to UGA and also are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with UGA for their services.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P101_S2	They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to UGA and to those other entities.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P101_S3	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with UGA have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of UGA and the shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	UGA may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the FCM, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P103_S2	A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as UGA trades using the clearing broker to be used by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P103_S3	A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	UGA could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	UGA may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UGA has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general partner of UGA could cause UGA to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P105_S2	However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P105_S3	UGA s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	UGA does not expect to make cash distributions.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	UGA has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Gasoline Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, UGA generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P107_S2	An investor should not invest in UGA if the investor will need cash distributions from UGA to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of UGA, if any, or for any other reason.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P107_S3	Nonetheless, although UGA does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Gasoline Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P107_S4	If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on UGA s NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by UGA during a relatively short period of time, UGA may not be able to satisfy the requests from UGA s assets not committed to trading.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P109_S1	As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in UGA s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The SEC adopted amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which became effective in 2016, to reform money market funds ( MMFs ).
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	While the new rule applies only to MMFs, it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P110_S2	A portion of UGA s assets that are not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts currently are invested in government MMFs.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P110_S3	UGA does not hold any non-government MMFs and, particularly in light of recent changes to the rule governing the operation of MMFs, does not anticipate investing in any non-government MMFs.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P110_S4	However, if UGA invests in other types of MMFs besides government MMFs in the future, UGA could be negatively impacted by investing in an MMF that does not maintain a stable $1.00 NAV or that has the potential to impose redemption fees and gates (temporary suspension of redemptions).
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets and could impair UGA in its ability to execute trades.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a clearing broker or an Exchange s clearing house, UGA could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	If such a bankruptcy were to occur, UGA would be afforded the protections granted to customers of an FCM, and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable CFTC regulations.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P112_S3	In any case, there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing UGA to recover all, or even any, of the amounts it has deposited as margin.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Bankruptcy of a clearing FCM can be caused by, among other things, the default of one of the FCM s customers.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P113_S1	In this event, the Exchange s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by UGA (as well as margin posted by other customers of the FCM) to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Consequently, UGA could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its futures positions, including assets posted as margin, and could sustain substantial losses.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	CFTC regulations impose several requirements on FCMs that are designed to protect customers, including mandating certain customer protections and the implementation of risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P114_S1	There can be no assurance these regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, UGA or its investors.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Notwithstanding that UGA could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its FCM, the majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The failure or bankruptcy of UGA s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The majority of UGA s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of UGA s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of UGA s total assets.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	It is possible that third parties might utilize UGA s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P119_S1	USCF has a patent for UGA s business method and has registered its trademarks.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	UGA does not currently have any proprietary software.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S1	However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of UGA s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S2	UGA may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S3	Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S4	As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P120_S5	Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from UGA, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Due to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, UGA is susceptible to operational and information security risks.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P122_S1	In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P122_S3	Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P122_S4	Cyber security failures or breaches of UGA s clearing broker or third party service provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of UGA shareholders to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P123_S1	UGA and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.
1396878_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	While UGA has established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such plans.
1396878_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although UGA may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, UGA is currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	UGA s shares have traded on the NYSE Arca under the symbol UGA since November 25, 2008.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to trading on the NYSE Arca, UGA s shares traded on the AMEX under the symbol UGA since its initial public offering on February 26, 2008.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth the range of reported high and low sales prices of the shares as reported on the AMEX and NYSE Arca, as applicable, for the periods indicated below.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA had approximately 13,012 holders of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	UGA has not made and does not currently intend to make cash distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	UGA does not purchase shares directly from its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	In connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Participants, UGA redeemed 12 baskets (comprising 600,000 shares) and 38 baskets (comprising 1,900,000 shares) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
1396878_18_ITEM5_P3_S2	Monthly redemptions for the last three months are detailed below.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of UGA included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UGA s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UGA s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UGA cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	UGA s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	UGA has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and UGA assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Although UGA undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UGA may make directly to them or through reports that UGA in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	UGA, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of gasoline, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on unleaded gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	UGA s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	UGA seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UGA s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	On any valuation day, the Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month futures contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for gasoline traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UGA are discussed in Item 1.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gasoline futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2017 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend during the year.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $1.671 per gallon.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The high of the year was on November 6, 2017 when the price reached $1.830 per gallon.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The low of the year was on June 21, 2017 when the price dropped to $1.404 per gallon.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $1.796 per gallon, an increase of approximately 7.48% over the year (investors are cautioned that these represent prices for gasoline on a wholesale basis and should not be directly compared to retail prices at a gasoline service station).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	UGA s per share NAV began the year at $31.37 and ended the year at $32.03 on December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 2.10% over the year.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	UGA s per share NAV reached its high for the year on November 6, 2017 at $32.93 and reached its low for the year on June 21, 2017 at $22.49.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2017 contracts and ended with the February 2018 contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase of approximately 7.48% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UGA seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UGA's Benchmark .
1396878_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, the gasoline futures market exhibited higher than normal contango.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	During periods of contango, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract is typically lower than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	On days when the market is in backwardation, the price of the near month gasoline Futures Contract is typically higher than the price of the next month gasoline Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Gasoline Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The per share NAV of UGA s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UGA investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	On February 26, 2008, UGA listed its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	On that day, UGA established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 300,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Group, in exchange for $15,001,000 in cash.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UGA s shares ceased trading on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, UGA has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30, 2010.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2017, UGA had issued 14,050,000 shares, 1,500,000 of which were outstanding.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2017, there were 65,950,000 shares registered but not yet issued.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	More shares may have been issued by UGA than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by UGA cannot be resold by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, UGA contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Company, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	UGA s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The management fee that UGA pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts in which UGA held and traded; and the increase in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for unleaded gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts in which UGA held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to UGA s smaller size as measured by total net assets; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher professional fees.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of gasoline Futures Contracts being held and traded; and the increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher number of unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts being held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The increase in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts in which UGA held and traded; and the increase in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for gasoline and the related increase in the value of the unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts in which UGA held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UGA, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a result, the amount of income earned by UGA as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 was due to UGA s smaller size as measured by total net assets; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher professional fees.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of unleaded gasoline Futures Contracts being held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	USCF seeks to manage UGA s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in UGA s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% (i.e., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	UGA s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UGA s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	For the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2017, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.087%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.089%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The average daily difference was 0.002% (or 0.2 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	NAV was 0.478%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The first chart below shows the daily movement of UGA s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2017, the last trading day in December.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UGA as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Since the commencement of the offering of UGA s shares to the public on February 26, 2008 to December 31, 2017, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.009%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UGA over the same time period was 0.007%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The average daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.765)%, meaning that over this time period UGA s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UGA versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UGA, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UGA s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 2.10%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	This is based on an initial per share NAV of $31.37 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2017 of $32.03.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $32.00 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of 2.00%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 2.10% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 2.00% was an error over the time period of 0.10%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return outperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 7.06%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $29.30 as of December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $31.37.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $31.50 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of 7.51%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of 7.06% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 7.51% was an error over the time period of (0.45)%, which is to say that UGA s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of UGA as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (13.57)%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	This was based on an initial per share NAV of $33.90 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $29.30.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	During this time period, UGA made no distributions to its shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	However, if UGA s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UGA would have had an estimated per share NAV of $29.50 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of (12.98)%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UGA of (13.57)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of (12.98)% was an error over the time period of (0.59)%, which is to say that UGA's actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	There are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact UGA s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	First, UGA may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UGA executes the trade.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	In that case, UGA may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of UGA to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	However, it may not always be possible for UGA to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UGA s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Second, UGA incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	At the same time, UGA earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	UGA is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UGA s NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	When this income exceeds the level of UGA s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UGA will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	USCF anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UGA will continue to be higher than interest earned by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	As such, USCF anticipates that UGA will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Third, UGA may hold Other Gasoline-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UGA that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA did not hold any Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	If UGA increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UGA may invest in Other Gasoline-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Term Structure of Gasoline Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	One factor arises from rolling futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near or front month contract) forward each month prior to expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	As an example, assume that the price of gasoline for immediate delivery, is $1.50 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also $1.50.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Over time, the price of gasoline will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical gallons of gasoline, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Contango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of UGA s shares and changes in the spot prices of gasoline will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $1.47 per gallon, or 2% cheaper than the $1.50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing gasoline prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.47 next month futures contract would rise to $1.50 as it approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of gasoline may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P50_S5	Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	If the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $1.50 per gallon, the price of the next month futures contract might be $1.53 per gallon, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the $1.53 next month futures contract would fall to $1.50 as it approaches expiration.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of gasoline may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	Similarly, the spot price of gasoline could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P51_S6	Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The chart below compares the daily price of the near month gasoline futures contract to the price of 13 th month gasoline futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13 th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13 th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13 th month futures contract prices (contango).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	An alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13 th month gasoline futures contract from the dollar price of the near month gasoline futures contract, as shown in the chart below.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	When the difference is negative, the market is in contango.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	The gasoline market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the price of the near month contract for the 10-year period between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	Investors will note that the near month gasoline futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	While the investment objective of UGA is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of gasoline, contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UGA shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	For example, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2016 and held December 31, 2017 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 2.10%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 7.48% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	By comparison, an investment in UGA shares made on December 31, 2015 and held to December 31, 2016 increased based upon the changes in the NAV for UGA shares on those days, by approximately 7.06%, while the spot price of gasoline for immediate delivery during the same period increased by 31.46% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing gasoline, which could be substantial).
1396878_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UGA s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UGA s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, the price of unleaded gasoline in the United States was impacted by several factors.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	In particular, USCF believes that excess supply of crude oil, the input product for gasoline, resulted in declining prices for the first few weeks of the year.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Subsequently, hopes that supply was peaking and would start declining later in 2017 combined with forecasts for demand growth may lead the price to rise until early June.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	Subsequently, prices have fallen somewhat and fluctuated in a tighter range than the first half of last year as investors weigh declining inventories against various views regarding prospects for future supply and demand growth.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, crude oil prices have traded in a range between $42 to $60 as U.S. production growth threatened to overwhelm the impact of OPEC supply cuts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Prices rose during the third quarter as U.S. and global inventories declined.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	U.S. storage fell faster than the normal seasonal pace and dropped below prior-year inventory levels for the first time since 2014.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	U.S. production ramped up steadily throughout the year, returning to record levels last seen during summer 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P59_S4	However, production and rig count growth both appeared to level off towards the end of the quarter and may represent caution on the part of producers.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Temporary disruptions also occurred as a result of hurricane Harvey.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Looking ahead, expected demand growth appears strong while OPEC has stated it is prepared to take any action necessary to perpetuate the current trend towards a balanced market.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Should global demand growth forecasts fail to be realized, or if OPEC is unable to counter growing U.S. production, there is a meaningful possibility that crude prices could fall again.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	On the other hand, increasing global tensions and the possibility of any number of conflicts escalating could lead to price shocks to the upside.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	USCF believes that over both the medium-term and the long-term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such as gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of gasoline to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	For example, higher gasoline prices cause American consumers to reduce their gasoline consumption, particularly during the high demand period of the summer driving season and gasoline prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	Furthermore, a slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy may have a greater impact on U.S. gasoline prices than on global crude oil prices.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	As a result, it is possible that changes in gasoline prices may not match the changes in crude oil prices.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Unleaded Gasoline Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories .
1396878_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	For the ten-year time period between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2017, the table below compares the monthly movements of unleaded gasoline prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and diesel-heating oil, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of gasoline on a monthly basis was strongly correlated with crude oil and diesel-heating oil, somewhat correlated with large cap U.S. equities and global equities, uncorrelated with natural gas, and somewhat negatively correlated with U.S. government bonds.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Over the one year period ended December 31, 2017, gasoline was moderately correlated to movements in U.S. government bonds, diesel-heating oil and natural gas, and displayed limited inverse correlation with large cap U.S. equities, global equities and crude oil.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between gasoline and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	USCF believes that gasoline has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that gasoline could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of gasoline more closely track the movements of equities or bonds.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of gasoline to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The correlations between gasoline, crude oil, natural gas and diesel-heating oil are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UGA s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UGA s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the gasoline Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of gasoline.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	UGA s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UGA s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	The values which are used by UGA for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, UGA estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	UGA has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	UGA has met, and it is anticipated that UGA will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	UGA s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	UGA currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets ) and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	UGA has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	UGA invests in Gasoline Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	A significant portion of UGA s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Gasoline Interests.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S4	The balance of the assets is held in UGA s account at its custodian bank and in investments in Treasuries at the FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S5	Income received from UGA s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA s expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2016, UGA's expenses exceeded the income UGA earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P74_S8	To the extent expenses exceed income, UGA s NAV will be negatively impacted.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	UGA s investments in gasoline Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	Such market conditions could prevent UGA from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2017, UGA did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UGA cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Since the initial offering of shares, UGA has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UGA s Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	If USCF and UGA are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UGA will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UGA entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell gasoline at a specified date in the future.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UGA s future cash requirements since UGA intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	As a result, UGA is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	UGA considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S4	The market risk associated with UGA s commitments to purchase gasoline is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S5	However, should UGA enter into a contractual commitment to sell gasoline, it would be required to make delivery of the gasoline at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P77_S6	Since there are no limits on the future price of gasoline, the market risk to UGA could be unlimited.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	UGA s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for gasoline, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	When UGA enters into Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	UGA is not currently a member of any clearinghouse.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P80_S4	There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UGA in such circumstances.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UGA by following various trading limitations and policies.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	In particular, UGA generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments it holds.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UGA to limit its credit exposure.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	An FCM, when acting on behalf of UGA in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UGA, all assets of UGA relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	FCMs are not allowed to commingle UGA s assets with their other assets.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UGA s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	In the future, UGA may purchase OTC swaps, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of OTC swaps.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $45,226,586 with the custodian and FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should UGA s custodian or FCM, as applicable, cease operations.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	While UGA s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UGA s financial position.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	UGA had no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of December 31, 2017 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UGA requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	UGA has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	UGA s primary contractual obligations are with USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UGA s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UGA, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UGA and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	However, since UGA s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UGA have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UGA, and not by USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent and the fees of BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection with the preparation of UGA s financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	USCF and UGA have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG, USOU and USOD, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	UGA also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UGA to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15% (15 basis points) of UGA s NAV, on an annualized basis.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S4	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P90_S5	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition to USCF s management fee, UGA pays its brokerage fees (including fees to an FCM), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UGA s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Commission payments to an FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	UGA also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	See Note 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UGA s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UGA s existence.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2017, UGA s portfolio consisted of 637 RBOB Gasoline Futures RB Contracts traded on the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	As of December 31, 2017, UGA did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.
1396878_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	For a list of UGA s current holdings, please see UGA s website at www.uscfinvestments.com.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	UGA is exposed to commodity price risk.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In particular, UGA is exposed to gasoline price risk through its holdings of Futures Contracts together with any other derivatives in which it may invest, which are discussed below.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Futures Contracts that UGA holds in its portfolio, as described in Contractual Obligations under Item 7 .
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, are expected to directly affect the value of UGA s shares.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	UGA may purchase OTC contracts such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	UGA may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions).
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UGA, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UGA shares.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	These EFRP transactions may expose UGA to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UGA s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UGA will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UGA due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s board of directors (the Board ).
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UGA only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P9_S2	UGA will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P10_S2	As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UGA limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	UGA anticipates that the use of Other Gasoline-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P12_S1	However, there can be no assurance of this.
1396878_18_ITEM7A_P12_S2	OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UGA s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	USCF assessed the effectiveness of UGA s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on the assessment, USCF believes that, as of December 31, 2017, UGA s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Gasoline Fund, LP (the Fund ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	We also have audited the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Gasoline Fund, LP as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Fund s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s financial statements and an opinion on the Fund s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P6_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have served as the Fund s auditor since 2008.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	* Collateral amounted to $3,992,699 on open futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	* Collateral amounted to $2,277,668 on open futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	* Interest income does not exceed paid in kind of 5%.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	See accompanying notes to financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The United States Gasoline Fund, LP ( UGA ) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	UGA is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	Prior to November 25, 2008, UGA s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P19_S3	UGA will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events as described in its Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of December 15, 2017 (the LP Agreement ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB , for delivery to the New York harbor), as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for gasoline traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UGA s collateral holdings, less UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	UGA s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of gasoline or any particular futures contract based on gasoline, nor is UGA s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day .
1396878_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner of UGA, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Gasoline-Related Investments (as defined below).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	UGA accomplishes its objective through investments in futures contracts for gasoline, crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ) and other gasoline-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for gasoline, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of gasoline, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Gasoline-Related Investments ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	As of December 31, 2017, UGA held 637 Futures Contracts for gasoline traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	UGA s per share NAV is calculated on each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	UGA uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, UGA incurred $9,033, $11,052 and $12,365, respectively, under this arrangement.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The fees and expenses associated with UGA s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	These costs were approximately $170,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $178,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	Tax reporting costs fluctuate between years due to the number of shareholders during any given year.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2017, USCF waived $231,179 of UGA s expenses.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 4 Contracts and Agreements .
1396878_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	UGA is party to a marketing agent agreement, dated as of February 15, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides certain marketing services for UGA as outlined in the agreement.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal to 0.06% on UGA s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UGA s assets in excess of $3 billion.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	In addition, UGA is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008, as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and registrar for UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P59_S3	USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services rendered to UGA and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	In addition, USCF pays BBH Co.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	USCF also pays BBH Co. transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	On October 8, 2013, UGA entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital or RBC ) to serve as UGA s FCM effective October 10, 2013.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The agreement with RBC requires it to provide services to UGA in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Gasoline-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC Capital for UGA s account.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	In accordance with the agreement, RBC Capital charges UGA commissions of approximately $7 to $8 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange, clearing and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P61_S3	Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UGA redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P61_S4	Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	UGA also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Gasoline-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher number of futures contracts being held and traded.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	However, there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	NYMEX Licensing Agreement UGA and the NYMEX entered into a licensing agreement on April 10, 2006, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UGA was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	Under the licensing agreement, UGA and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG, USOU and USOD, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in Note 3.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	UGA expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UGA by the NYMEX and acknowledges that NYMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange are registered trademarks of the NYMEX.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	UGA may engage in the trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts, cleared swaps and OTC swaps (collectively, derivatives ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	UGA is exposed to both market risk, which is the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	UGA may enter into futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Cleared swaps are agreements that are eligible to be cleared by a clearinghouse, e.g., ICE Clear Europe, and provide the efficiencies and benefits that centralized clearing on an exchange offers to traders of futures contracts, including credit risk intermediation and the ability to offset positions initiated with different counterparties.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The purchase and sale of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps require margin deposits with an FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Futures contracts, options on futures contracts and cleared swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UGA has in the particular classes of instruments.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Buying and selling options on futures contracts exposes investors to the risks of purchasing or selling futures contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	All of the futures contracts held by UGA through December 31, 2017 were exchange-traded.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with OTC swaps since, in OTC swaps, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	However, in the future, if UGA were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on the transaction.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	UGA has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	In addition, UGA bears the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	UGA s cash and other property, such as Treasuries, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the FCM s segregation requirements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	The insolvency of an FCM could result in the complete loss of UGA s assets posted with that FCM; however, the majority of UGA s assets are held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UGA s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency of an FCM.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	The failure or insolvency of UGA s custodian, however, could result in a substantial loss of UGA s assets.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	USCF invests a portion of UGA s cash in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per share NAV.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	UGA is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment in such money market funds.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	Theoretically, UGA is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	As both a buyer and a seller of options, UGA pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	UGA s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	In addition, UGA has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The financial instruments held by UGA are reported in its statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following table presents per share performance data and other supplemental financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for the shareholders.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Total returns are calculated based on the change in value during the period.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	An individual shareholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following summarized (unaudited) quarterly financial information presents the results of operations and other data for three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	UGA values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of UGA (observable inputs) and (2) UGA s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The three levels defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:
1396878_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).
1396878_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Level III Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2017 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of UGA s securities at December 31, 2016 using the fair value hierarchy:
1396878_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, UGA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivatives.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, modifying ASU 2014-09.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	ASU 2015-14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	At this time, management does not believe there will be any impact to the Fund s financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	UGA has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	This evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Commodity Funds LLC (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related notes to these financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements).

1396878_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P105_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety:
1396878_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities, without adjustment.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in active markets of similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, valuation of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, if any.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P140_S1	If necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets until it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company provides for uncertain tax positions using guidance which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	It provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the accounting standard and in subsequent periods.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P141_S2	In addition, the accounting standard provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

1396878_18_ITEM8_P144_S1	The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P144_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
1396878_18_ITEM8_P144_S3	The new standard is effective for public business entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods.

1396878_18_ITEM10_P35_S0	Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of UGA are not compensated by UGA, but instead by USCF, UGA does not have a compensation committee.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P35_S1	Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of UGA.

1396878_18_ITEM10_P36_S1	USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience.

1396878_18_ITEM10_P40_S1	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis to preside over each such executive session.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P40_S2	Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Ellis by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com.

1396878_18_ITEM10_P41_S2	The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis as the presiding independent director.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P41_S3	Mr. Ellis role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to UGA s Corporate Governance Policy.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P42_S0	The Board believes that Mr. Gerber is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF as the founder of USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P42_S1	Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading discussions and execution of new strategic objectives while facilitating information flow between USCF and the full Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P42_S2	The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P42_S3	USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Gerber brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S0	The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face UGA and the Related Public Funds.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S1	For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S2	The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by UGA, including Futures Contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments such as OTC swap contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S3	Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by UGA.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S4	The policies, among other things, limit UGA s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P43_S5	Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P44_S0	The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P45_S0	There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P45_S1	For example, if position limits are imposed on UGA and the assets under management continue to increase, then UGA may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contract and may have to invest in OTC swap contracts or Other Gasoline-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P45_S2	Other Futures Contracts in which UGA may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P45_S3	Other Gasoline-Related Investments, including OTC swap contracts, may also expose UGA to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P45_S4	UGA and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any OTC swap contracts or other investments.
1396878_18_ITEM10_P46_S0	In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of UGA s public disclosure, UGA will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by UGA of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards.

1396878_18_ITEM11_P0_S1	The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of UGA and other entities controlled by USCF.
1396878_18_ITEM11_P0_S2	UGA does not reimburse USCF for, nor does it set the amount or form of any portion of, the compensation paid to the executive officers by USCF.

1396878_18_ITEM13_P3_S0	In February 2017, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, UGA or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities.
1396878_18_ITEM13_P3_S1	As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
1396878_18_ITEM14_P0_S0	The fees for services billed to UGA by its independent auditors for the last two fiscal years are as follows:
