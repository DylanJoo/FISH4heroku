100378_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Primary competitive factors for the Company s products are performance, price, service and availability.
100378_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2011.
100378_11_ITEM1_P5_S4	There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011.
100378_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $146,899,000 at June 30, 2011 compares to $84,419,000 at June 30, 2010.
100378_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company saw an increase in orders by oil and gas customers for its 8500 series transmission as higher oil and gas prices have driven demand for new high-horsepower rigs.
100378_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the Government.
100378_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2,475,000, $2,347,000 and $2,636,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
100378_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $8,776,000, $7,885,000 and $9,142,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
100378_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company s development of its 7500 series transmission is in the final testing phase, and initial shipment of production units has begun.
100378_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The 7500 series transmission is specifically designed for oil and gas high-pressure pumping applications, and is expected to offer significant advantages in those applications over the Company s current product mix.
100378_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	For example, the 7500 series transmission will be considerably lighter than the Company s 8500 series transmission, and will be able to fit within the frame rails of on-road fracturing rigs so that the rigs won t need special permits to move from one field to another.
100378_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	It is also designed to work in a range of 1500 to 2500 horsepower, which is a larger market than the 2500 to 3000 horsepower application market for the Company s 8500 series transmission.
100378_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In fiscal 2011, the Company completed the development and introduced the Express Joystick System (EJS ) to the marine market.
100378_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The EJS smoothly and simultaneously actuates and controls engines, transmissions and thrusters to allow for effortless movement of the boat in any direction.
100378_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2011 was 941.
100378_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. Dollar or Euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen a significant growth in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The growth in these markets has been spurred by the rise in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, there has been a substantial increase in capital investment by companies in these markets.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	While this market has recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011, the cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors can have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Although there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relation, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 59% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy and Switzerland.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, we have international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy and Canada.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2011 s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Any failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	While some recovery has been seen in 2011, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delay and lengthen sales cycles.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company s amended revolving credit facility and senior notes agreements require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum EBITDA, as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	At June 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient EBITDA levels throughout fiscal 2012 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
100378_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns two manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S.A., one in Nivelles, Belgium, two in Decima, Italy and one in Novazzano, Switzerland.
100378_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate floor space of these six plants approximates 847,000 square feet.
100378_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	One of the Racine facilities includes office space, which includes the Company's corporate headquarters.
100378_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company leases additional manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Italy (Limite sull Arno) and India (outsourcing office in Chennai).
100378_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company also has operations in the following locations, all of which are leased and are used for sales offices, warehousing and light assembly or product service:
100378_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes its properties are well maintained and adequate for its present and anticipated needs.
100378_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Twin Disc is a defendant in several product liability or related claims of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.
100378_11_ITEM4_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included as an unnumbered Item in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on October 21, 2011.

100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9(a).
100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

100378_11_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

100378_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and partially owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
100378_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	The Company also has a noncontrolling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_11_ITEM15_P14_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is included in equity.
100378_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_11_ITEM15_P15_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction losses (gains) of $1,141,000, ($571,000) and ($328,000) in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
100378_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,093,000 and $1,792,000 at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

100378_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	The current conditions in the global credit markets may reduce a customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_11_ITEM15_P17_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that the adverse impact of the global credit crisis may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $19,589,000 and $22,977,000 at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
100378_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	The fair value of long-term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_11_ITEM15_P18_S3	This rate was represented by the US Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (0.81% and 1.00% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively), plus the current add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (2.00% and 3.00% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively) resulting in a total rate of 2.81% and 4.00% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
100378_11_ITEM15_P18_S4	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement approximates fair value at June 30, 2011.
100378_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury and restricts all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.

100378_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was the Euro.
100378_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.

100378_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_11_ITEM15_P27_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
100378_11_ITEM15_P27_S4	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles -- Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired in accordance with the ASC Topic 360-10, Intangibles Goodwill and Other.
100378_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_11_ITEM15_P35_S3	For purposes of the June 30, 2011 impairment analysis, the Company has utilized discounted cash flow analyses.
100378_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	In the second step, the implied value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Based upon the goodwill impairment review completed at the end of fiscal 2011, which incorporates management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions, the fair value of goodwill in each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
100378_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2011 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Warranty --The Company warrants all assembled products and parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) against defective materials or workmanship.

100378_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers.
100378_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation.
100378_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	The warranty reserve is established based on the Company s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
100378_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends.
100378_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	While the Company believes the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires.

100378_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Stock-Based Compensation --At June 30, 2011, the Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note K, Stock-Based Compensation.

100378_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

100378_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	This update is to be applied prospectively effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 (the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2012).

100378_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued a standards update providing guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition.
100378_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	Consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive.
100378_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	This update was effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (July 1, 2010 for the Company) and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

100378_11_ITEM15_P138_S1	Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.
100378_11_ITEM15_P138_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company incurred operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_11_ITEM15_P139_S1	The Company has evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions and concluded that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized, therefore, has established a full valuation allowance of $2,751,000 against the balance.

100378_11_ITEM15_P140_S2	This reconciliation identified an error in the fiscal 2009 tax provision, which resulted in understating fiscal 2009 earnings by $188,000.
100378_11_ITEM15_P140_S3	To correct this error, the Company reduced tax expense by $188,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
100378_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company determined the deferred tax liability surrounding fixed assets at a foreign location was incorrectly recorded.
100378_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	To correct for this, the Company booked a $392,000 deferred tax liability (additional tax expense) in the fourth quarter.
100378_11_ITEM15_P141_S2	Of this amount, $458,000 should have been recorded in prior fiscal periods.
100378_11_ITEM15_P141_S3	In addition, the Company made a correction to the current tax accrual at another foreign location during the fourth quarter.
100378_11_ITEM15_P141_S4	This correction resulted in a $298,000 tax benefit in the fourth quarter which should have been recorded in prior fiscal periods.
100378_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	The Company believes that the above errors were not material to the current or any previously issued financial statements.
100378_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Following is a reconciliation of the applicable U.S. federal income taxes to the actual income taxes reflected in the statements of operations (in thousands):

100378_11_ITEM15_P144_S2	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_11_ITEM15_P144_S3	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
100378_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Annually, we file income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States.
100378_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2003 through 2010 for our major operations in the U.S., Italy, Belgium and Japan.

100378_11_ITEM15_P146_S3	The Company s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

100378_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Primary competitive factors for the Company s products are performance, price, service and availability.
100378_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 49% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2012.
100378_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $98,746,000 at June 30, 2012 compares to $146,899,000 at June 30, 2011.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company saw a decline in orders by oil and gas customers for its 8500 series transmission as current demand has softened for new high-horsepower rigs due to the North American natural gas supply overhang and lower prices.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, the Company has begun to accept orders and has shipped initial units of its new 7500 series transmission for the oil and gas market.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the Government.
100378_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2,657,000, $2,475,000 and $2,347,000 in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2012 was 1,029.
100378_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.

100378_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Twin Disc is a defendant in several product liability or related claims of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.

100378_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company currently has a $40 million revolving loan agreement, which is due to expire on May 31, 2015.
100378_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	In accordance with the loan agreement as amended, the Company borrows at LIBOR plus an additional Add-On, between 1.5% and 2.5%, depending on the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio .
100378_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Due to the relative stability of interest rates, the Company did not utilize any financial instruments at June 30, 2012 to manage interest rate risk exposure.
100378_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	A 10 percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately $31,000.
100378_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Commodity price risk - The Company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum.
100378_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure.
100378_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Direct material cost as a percent of total cost of goods sold was 53.8% for fiscal 2012.
100378_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Currency risk - The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
100378_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Of that total, approximately seventy three percent was denominated in Euros with the balance comprised of Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and the Australian and Singapore Dollars.
100378_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
100378_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity.
100378_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
100378_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Derivative financial instruments - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company corporate treasury department and restrict derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other Income (Expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2012 and 2011 was the Euro.
100378_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	At June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.

100378_12_ITEM15_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Twin Disc, Incorporated:
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Sates of America.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S2	Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9(a).
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
100378_12_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_12_ITEM15_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
100378_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and partially owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
100378_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_12_ITEM15_P13_S2	The Company also has a noncontrolling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_12_ITEM15_P13_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is included in equity.
100378_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction (gains) losses of ($1,103,000), $1,141,000 and ($571,000) in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,194,000 and $2,093,000 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable but not yet clearly associated with a specific customer.
100378_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $15,768,000 and $19,589,000 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM15_P17_S2	The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_12_ITEM15_P17_S3	This rate was represented by the US Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (0.41% and 0.81% for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively), plus the current add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (1.50% and 2.00% for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively) resulting in a total rate of 1.91% and 2.81% for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_12_ITEM15_P17_S4	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement approximates fair value at June 30, 2012.
100378_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury and restricts all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_12_ITEM15_P21_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2012 and 2011 was the Euro.
100378_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	At June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_12_ITEM15_P26_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
100378_12_ITEM15_P26_S4	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles -- Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired in accordance with the ASC Topic 350-10, Intangibles Goodwill and Other.
100378_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_12_ITEM15_P34_S3	For purposes of the June 30, 2012 impairment analysis, the Company has utilized discounted cash flow analyses.
100378_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	In the second step, the implied value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Based upon the goodwill impairment review completed in conjunction with the preparation of the annual financial statements at the end of fiscal 2012, which incorporates management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions, it was determined that the goodwill for one of the Company s reporting units was fully impaired.
100378_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The fair value of goodwill for each of the remaining reporting units exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
100378_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	See Note D for additional discussion of the fiscal 2012 impairment charge.
100378_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2012 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

100378_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The components of the net deferred tax asset as of June 30 are summarized in the table below (in thousands).
100378_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
100378_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.
100378_12_ITEM15_P140_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company continued to incur operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	The Company has evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions and concluded that based primarily upon continuing losses in these jurisdictions and failure to achieve targeted levels of improvement, a full valuation allowance continues to be necessary.

100378_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets.

100378_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	The Company believes these tax errors were not material to the 2010 or any previously issued financial statements.
100378_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	In addition, these errors do not impact the fiscal 2011 or 2012 consolidated financial statements.

100378_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	This reconciliation identified an error in the fiscal 2011 tax provision, which resulted in overstating fiscal 2011 earnings by $608,000.
100378_12_ITEM15_P143_S3	To correct this error, the Company increased tax expense by $608,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
100378_12_ITEM15_P143_S4	This adjustment was effectively offset by normal provision to return adjustments in the quarter, resulting in a minimal impact on the effective tax rate.
100378_12_ITEM15_P143_S5	The Company believes this tax error was not material to the 2012 or any previously issued financial statements.

100378_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	The Company reaffirms its position that these earnings remain permanently reinvested, and has no plans to repatriate funds to the U.S. for the foreseeable future.
100378_12_ITEM15_P145_S2	These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $8.1 million at June 30, 2012.
100378_12_ITEM15_P145_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_12_ITEM15_P145_S4	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.

100378_12_ITEM15_P146_S3	It is reasonably possible that at least one of these audit cycles will be completed during fiscal 2013.
100378_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	The Company has approximately $560,000 of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2012, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate.

100378_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $41,000 and $136,000, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
100378_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial position.
100378_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	(1) Amounts primarily represent accounts receivable written-off during the year, along with other adjustments (primarily foreign currency translation adjustments).

100378_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date hereof (the Report ), I, Christopher J. Eperjesy, Vice President Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	(2) the information contained in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. Dollar or Euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen a significant growth in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The growth in these markets has been spurred by the rise in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, there has been a substantial increase in capital investment by companies in these markets.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	While this market has recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011 and 2012, the cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relation, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 53% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy and Switzerland.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2012 s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Any failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	While some recovery has been seen in 2011and 2012, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delay and lengthen sales cycles.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company s amended revolving credit facility and senior notes agreements require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum EBITDA, as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	At June 30, 2012, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient EBITDA levels throughout fiscal 2013 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
100378_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 45% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2013.
100378_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	There was one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $66,765,000 at June 30, 2013 compares to $98,746,000 at June 30, 2012.
100378_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company saw a decline in orders by oil and gas customers for its 8500 series transmission as current demand has softened for new high-horsepower rigs due to the North American natural gas supply overhang and lower prices.
100378_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the Government.
100378_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $3,058,000, $2,657,000 and $2,475,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $9,396,000, $9,508,000 and $8,776,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2013 was 990.
100378_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. Dollar or Euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen a significant growth in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The growth in these markets has been spurred by the rise in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, there has been a substantial increase in capital investment by companies in these markets.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	While this market recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011 and 2012, the Company has experienced a softening in demand through fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although there was only one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2013, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 55% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, India and Switzerland.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, we have international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, India and Canada.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2013 s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Any failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	While some recovery was seen in 2011 through 2013, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delayed and lengthened sales cycles.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s revolving credit facilities and senior notes agreement require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum EBITDA, as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	At June 30, 2013, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient EBITDA levels throughout fiscal 2014 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
100378_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns two manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S.A., one in Nivelles, Belgium, two in Decima, Italy and one in Novazzano, Switzerland.
100378_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate floor space of these six plants approximates 767,000 square feet.
100378_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	One of the Racine facilities includes office space, which includes the Company's corporate headquarters.
100378_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company leases additional manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Italy (Limite sull Arno) and India (outsourcing office in Chennai and manufacturing facility in Kancheepuram).
100378_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company also has operations in the following locations, all of which are leased and are used for sales offices, warehousing and light assembly or product service:
100378_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes its properties are well maintained and adequate for its present and anticipated needs.
100378_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	Twin Disc is a defendant in several product liability or related claims of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.
100378_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included as an unnumbered Item in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on October 18, 2013.

100378_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table compares total shareholder return over the last five fiscal years to the Standard Poor s 500 Machinery (Industrial) Index and the Russell 2000 index.
100378_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The S P 500 Machinery (Industrial) Index consists of a broad range of manufacturers.

100378_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	The Company believes, because of the similarity of its business with those companies contained in the S P 500 Machinery (Industrial) Index, that comparison of shareholder return with this index is appropriate.

100378_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Discussion of the Company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the LIBOR interest rate.
100378_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company currently has a $40 million revolving loan agreement, which is due to expire on May 31, 2015.
100378_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	In accordance with the loan agreement as amended, the Company borrows at LIBOR plus an additional Add-On, between 1.5% and 2.5%, depending on the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio .
100378_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Due to the relative stability of interest rates, the Company did not utilize any financial instruments at June 30, 2013 to manage interest rate risk exposure.
100378_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	A 10 percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately $30,000.
100378_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Commodity price risk - The Company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum.
100378_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure.
100378_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Direct material cost as a percent of total cost of goods sold was 55.6% for fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Currency risk - The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
100378_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Approximately twenty two percent of the Company s revenues in the year ended June 30, 2013 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
100378_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Of that total, approximately seventy percent was denominated in Euros with the balance comprised of Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Swiss Franc and the Australian and Singapore Dollars.
100378_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
100378_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity.
100378_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
100378_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other Income (Expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2013 and 2012 was the Euro.
100378_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.

100378_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Twin Disc, Incorporated:
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting , included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9(a) .
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
100378_13_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
100378_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and partially owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
100378_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	The Company also has a controlling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_13_ITEM15_P13_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in equity.
100378_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_13_ITEM15_P14_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $642,000, $1,103,000 and ($1,141,000) in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,884,000 and $2,194,000 at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable but not yet clearly associated with a specific customer.
100378_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $11,536,000 and $15,768,000 at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S4	This rate was represented by the US Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (0.66% and 0.41% for fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively), plus the current add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (1.65% and 1.50% for fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively) resulting in a total rate of 2.31% and 1.91% for fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM15_P17_S5	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement approximates fair value at June 30, 2013.
100378_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury and restricts all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2013 and 2012 was the Euro.
100378_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_13_ITEM15_P27_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
100378_13_ITEM15_P27_S4	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_13_ITEM15_P29_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_13_ITEM15_P29_S4	Refer to Note G for discussion of the impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles -- Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350-10, Intangibles Goodwill and Other.
100378_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations.
100378_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	For purposes of the June 30, 2013 impairment analysis, the Company has utilized discounted cash flow analyses.
100378_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Based upon the goodwill impairment review completed in conjunction with the preparation of the annual financial statements at the end of fiscal 2013, which incorporates management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions, it was determined that the fair value of goodwill for each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
100378_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2013 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Reclassification --Certain amounts in the 2012 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the fiscal 2013 financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	Specifically, $478,000 has been reclassified from Building to Land in Note C.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company identified errors related to its reserve for uncertain tax positions that affected prior periods beginning in the year ended June 30, 2007 and subsequent periods through September 28, 2012.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	In evaluating whether the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements were materially misstated, the Company considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and ASC Topic 250-10-S99-1, Assessing Materiality.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Company concluded this error was not material individually or in the aggregate to any of the prior reporting periods.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	However, the cumulative error would be material in the year ended June 30, 2013, if the entire correction was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	As such, the revision for this correction to the applicable prior periods is reflected in the financial information herein.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S5	As a result of correcting the errors related to its reserve for uncertain tax positions, net earnings attributable to Twin Disc was decreased by $69,000 and $50,000 in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S6	The cumulative impact of this error correction prior to fiscal 2011 was to reduce shareholders equity at June 30, 2010 by $658,000.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S7	In addition to recording this correcting adjustment, the Company recorded other adjustments to prior period amounts to correct other immaterial out-of-period adjustments related to income taxes, including those that had been previously disclosed.
100378_13_ITEM15_P48_S8	As a result of correcting these other immaterial out-of-period adjustments, net earnings attributable to Twin Disc was increased by $700,000 in fiscal 2012 and decreased by $783,000 in fiscal 2011.
100378_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	impact of these other immaterial out-of-period adjustments prior to fiscal 2011 was to increase shareholders equity at June 30, 2010 by $83,000.
100378_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The impacts of these revisions are shown in the following tables (in 000 s):
100378_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance designed to clarify the financial statement presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
100378_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013 (the Company s third quarter of fiscal 2014), and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
100378_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance designed to improve the transparency in reporting amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income.
100378_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	This new guidance will require presentation of the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and a cross-reference to other disclosure currently required for the reclassification items.
100378_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	The amended guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 (the Company s third quarter of fiscal 2013).
100378_13_ITEM15_P52_S3	See Note M for the additional disclosures required by this new guidance.
100378_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.
100378_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	After an assessment of certain qualitative factors, if it is determined to be more likely than not that an indefinite-lived asset is impaired, entities must perform the quantitative impairment test.
100378_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional.
100378_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The amended guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 (the Company s fiscal 2014), with early adoption permitted.
100378_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial results.
100378_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued a standards update that is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment.

100378_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.

100378_13_ITEM15_P164_S2	These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $17.8 million at June 30, 2013.
100378_13_ITEM15_P164_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_13_ITEM15_P164_S4	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on such earnings.

100378_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 41% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	There was one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2014.
100378_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $66,102,000 at June 30, 2014 compares to $66,765,000 at June 30, 2013.
100378_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the Government.
100378_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $3,028,000, $3,058,000 and $2,657,000 in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $10,900,000, $10,242,000 and $10,316,000 in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2014 was 970.
100378_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. Dollar or Euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen a significant growth in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The growth in these markets has been spurred by the rise in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, there has been a substantial increase in capital investment by companies in these markets.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	While this market recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011 and 2012, the Company has experienced a softening in demand through fiscal 2013 and into fiscal 2014.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although there was only one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2014, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 59% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, India and Switzerland.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, we have international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, India and Canada.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2014 s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Any failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	While some recovery was seen in 2011 through 2014, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delayed and lengthened sales cycles.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s revolving credit facility and senior notes agreement require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum EBITDA, as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	At June 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ) levels throughout fiscal 2015 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
100378_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns two manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S.A., one in Nivelles, Belgium, two in Decima, Italy and one in Novazzano, Switzerland.
100378_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate floor space of these six plants approximates 767,000 square feet.
100378_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	One of the Racine facilities includes office space, which includes the Company's corporate headquarters.
100378_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company leases additional manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Italy (Limite sull Arno) and India (outsourcing office in Chennai and manufacturing facility in Kancheepuram).
100378_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company also has operations in the following locations, all of which are leased and are used for sales offices, warehousing and light assembly or product service:
100378_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes its properties are well maintained and adequate for its present and anticipated needs.
100378_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	Twin Disc is a defendant in several product liability or related claims of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.
100378_14_ITEM4_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included as an unnumbered Item in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on October 24, 2014.

100378_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	The Company believes, because of the similarity of its business with those companies contained in the S P 500 Machinery (Industrial) Index, that comparison of shareholder return with this index is appropriate.

100378_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	Balance Sheet Data (at end of period):
100378_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodities and foreign currency exchange rates.
100378_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses financial instruments and other proactive management techniques.
100378_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
100378_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Discussion of the Company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the LIBOR interest rate.
100378_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company currently has a $60 million revolving loan agreement, which is due to expire on May 31, 2018.
100378_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	In accordance with the loan agreement as amended, the Company borrows at LIBOR plus an additional Add-On of 1.0%.
100378_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Due to the relative stability of interest rates, the Company did not utilize any financial instruments at June 30, 2014 to manage interest rate risk exposure.
100378_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	A 10 percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately $13,000.
100378_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Commodity price risk - The Company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum.
100378_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure.

100378_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Currency risk - The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
100378_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Approximately twenty-three percent of the Company s revenues in the year ended June 30, 2014 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
100378_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Of that total, approximately sixty-nine percent was denominated in euros with the balance comprised of Japanese yen, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and the Australian and Singapore dollars.
100378_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
100378_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity.
100378_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies.

100378_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.

100378_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other Income (Expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was the Euro.
100378_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	At June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.

100378_14_ITEM15_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Twin Disc, Incorporated:
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9(a).
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
100378_14_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
100378_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.

100378_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and partially owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
100378_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_14_ITEM15_P13_S2	The Company also has a controlling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_14_ITEM15_P13_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_14_ITEM15_P14_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in equity.
100378_14_ITEM15_P14_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_14_ITEM15_P14_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $293,000, $642,000 and $1,103,000 in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,637,000 and $2,884,000 at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable but not yet clearly associated with a specific customer.
100378_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_14_ITEM15_P16_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_14_ITEM15_P16_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S2	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $7,605,000 and $11,536,000 at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S3	The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S4	This rate was represented by the US Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (0.88% and 0.66% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively), plus the current add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (1.00% and 1.65% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively) resulting in a total rate of 1.88% and 2.31% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P17_S5	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement approximates fair value at June 30, 2014.
100378_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury and restricts all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was the Euro.
100378_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	At June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_14_ITEM15_P27_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_14_ITEM15_P27_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
100378_14_ITEM15_P27_S4	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_14_ITEM15_P31_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles -- Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired.
100378_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P35_S3	For purposes of the June 30, 2014 impairment analysis, the Company has utilized discounted cash flow analyses.
100378_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Based upon the goodwill impairment review completed in conjunction with the preparation of the annual financial statements at the end of fiscal 2014, which incorporates management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions, it was determined that the fair value of goodwill for each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
100378_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2014 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company recorded out-of-period adjustments related to the correction of errors identified late in the year-end closing process of fiscal 2013 that were deemed immaterial for adjustment to the fiscal 2013 financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	The impact of these corrections to the fiscal 2014 first quarter and full year results was to increase earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest by $437,000 and increase net earnings attributable to Twin Disc by $69,000 (after considering applicable tax effects).
100378_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	The nature of these errors is as follows:
100378_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company had over accrued for certain payroll related items totaling $337,000 as of June 30, 2013, resulting in an increase to earnings from operations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company determined that work-in-process inventory had been overstated by $117,000 as of June 30, 2013.
100378_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	As a result, additional cost of goods sold was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, resulting in a decrease to earnings from operations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company does not believe these errors are material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors is material to the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued stock compensation guidance requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
100378_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company s fiscal 2017).
100378_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial disclosures.
100378_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on revenue from contracts with customers.
100378_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	This revenue recognition guidance supersedes existing US GAAP guidance, including most industry-specific guidance.
100378_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
100378_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	The guidance identifies steps to apply in achieving this principle.
100378_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018).
100378_14_ITEM15_P53_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial disclosures and results.
100378_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the reporting for discontinued operations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	The new guidance also requires expanded financial disclosures about discontinued operations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	The amendments in this updated guidance are effective for the first quarter of the Company s fiscal 2016.
100378_14_ITEM15_P54_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial disclosures.
100378_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance stating that, except in certain defined circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
100378_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2013 (the Company s fiscal 2015).
100378_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial disclosures.
100378_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the parent company s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity.
100378_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	This guidance clarifies the circumstances under which the related cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income.
100378_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2013 (the Company s fiscal 2015).
100378_14_ITEM15_P56_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial results.
100378_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	The major classes of inventories at June 30 were as follows (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 28% and 30% of total inventories at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $27,180,000 and $25,101,000 at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $7,591,000 and $7,122,000 at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

100378_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $10,180,000, $10,120,000 and $9,947,000, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, substantially all of which is allocated to the manufacturing segment, for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 and concluded these assets are not impaired.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by applying a fair value based test using discounted cash flow analyses, in accordance with ASC 350-10, Intangibles Goodwill and Other.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The inputs utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis used to measure the fair value of goodwill are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	The result of this assessment identified that one of the Company s reporting units goodwill was fully impaired, necessitating a non-cash charge of $3,670,000.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S3	The impairment was due to a declining outlook in the global pleasure craft/mega yacht market, the weakened European economy, few signs of significant near-term recovery in the markets served by this reporting unit and the heightened economic risk profile of this Italian reporting unit as of June 30, 2012.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S4	These factors were identified as the Company conducted its annual budget review process during the fourth fiscal quarter, and the Company concluded that the impairment charge was necessary in connection with the preparation of the year end financial statements.
100378_14_ITEM15_P63_S5	The fair value of the goodwill for the remaining reporting units exceeds the respective carrying values.
100378_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	At June 30, the following acquired intangible assets have definite useful lives and are subject to amortization (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Other intangibles consist of certain amortizable acquisition costs, proprietary technology, computer software, certain customer relationships and debt issuance costs on the 6.05% notes.
100378_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company committed to a plan and entered negotiations to exit the distribution agreement and sell the inventory of its Italian distributor back to the parent supplier.
100378_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	This decision triggered an impairment review of the long lived assets at this entity, resulting in an impairment charge of $1,405,000, representing a complete impairment of the remaining intangibles ($1,277,000) and fixed assets ($128,000) for this entity.
100378_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	The impairment charge was determined by deriving the fair value of the asset group utilizing a discounted cash flow model.
100378_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	Significant inputs to this model include the discount rate, sales projections and profitability estimates.
100378_14_ITEM15_P66_S4	These inputs would be considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
100378_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets included in the table above is approximately 16 years.
100378_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Intangible amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $477,000, $718,000 and $809,000, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Estimated intangible amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	The gross carrying amount of the Company s intangible assets that have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 are $223,000 and $2,125,000, respectively.
100378_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Based on the Company s reassessment of the useful lives assigned to intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, it was determined that certain indefinite lived trade names should be reclassified to definite lived.
100378_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	As such, the Company assigned a 20-year useful life to the trade names.
100378_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Accrued liabilities at June 30 were as follows (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company warrants all assembled products, parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) and service against defective materials or workmanship.
100378_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
100378_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers.
100378_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation.

100378_14_ITEM15_P169_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	Company continued to incur operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_14_ITEM15_P170_S1	The Company has evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions and concluded that based primarily upon continuing losses in these jurisdictions and failure to achieve targeted levels of improvement, a full valuation allowance continues to be necessary.
100378_14_ITEM15_P170_S2	Therefore, the Company recorded an additional valuation allowance of $1,869,000.

100378_14_ITEM15_P172_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_14_ITEM15_P172_S4	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on such earnings.
100378_14_ITEM15_P172_S5	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
100378_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	Annually, we file income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States.
100378_14_ITEM15_P173_S1	In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2010 through 2014 for our major operations in Italy, Belgium and Japan.

100378_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	The Company has approximately $1,603,000 of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2014, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate.
100378_14_ITEM15_P175_S1	During the fiscal year the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to the tax positions taken during the fiscal year partially offset by settlements with various taxing authorities.
100378_14_ITEM15_P175_S2	During the next twelve months, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $800,000 as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations.
100378_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	The Company s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
100378_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	Below is a reconciliation of beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
100378_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	Substantially all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2014, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
100378_14_ITEM15_P178_S1	As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $309,000 and $296,000, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
100378_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial position.
100378_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $961,000 representing the incremental cost above the minimum legal indemnity for a targeted workforce reduction at its Belgian operation, following finalization of negotiations with the local labor unions.
100378_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	The minimum legal indemnity of $548,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, upon announcement of the intended restructuring action.
100378_14_ITEM15_P180_S2	During fiscal 2014, the Company made cash payments of $857,000, resulting in an accrual balance at June 30, 2014 of $785,000.
100378_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	(1) Activity primarily represents amounts written-off during the year, along with other adjustments (primarily foreign currency translation adjustments).
100378_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	(2) Represents adjustments resulting from foreign tax audits.

Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:

100378_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date hereof (the Report ), I, Christopher J. Eperjesy, Vice President Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	the information contained in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the commercial, pleasure craft, and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations, particularly in Europe, are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	There was one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 11% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015.
100378_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $34,397,000 at June 30, 2015 compares to $66,102,000 at June 30, 2014.
100378_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
100378_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2,288,000, $3,028,000 and $3,058,000 in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $11,091,000, $10,900,000 and $10,242,000 in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
100378_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2015 was 921.
100378_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. dollar and the euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar or euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While this market recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011 and 2012, the Company has since experienced a softening in demand through fiscal 2015.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although there was only one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 51% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, India and Switzerland.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, we have international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, India and Canada.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2015 s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Any failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	While some recovery was seen in the markets served by the Company in 2011 through 2015, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delayed and lengthened sales cycles.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company s revolving credit facility and senior notes agreement require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ), as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	At June 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient EBITDA levels throughout fiscal 2016 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.

100378_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Discussion of the Company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the LIBOR interest rate.

100378_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity.

100378_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other Income (Expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.

100378_15_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_15_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

100378_15_ITEM15_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_15_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

100378_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	Under the Company s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment.
100378_15_ITEM15_P15_S2	To the extent that checks issued, but not yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable.
100378_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,183,000 and $3,637,000 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable.
100378_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_15_ITEM15_P17_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S2	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $3,726,000 and $7,605,000 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S3	The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S4	This rate was represented by the U.S.Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (1.01% and 0.88% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively), plus the current add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (1.00% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014) resulting in a total rate of 2.01% and 1.88% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_15_ITEM15_P18_S5	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement approximates fair value at June 30, 2015.
100378_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments --The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury and restricts all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was the euro.
100378_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	At June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
100378_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_15_ITEM15_P30_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles --Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired.
100378_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_15_ITEM15_P35_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations.
100378_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	In the second step, the implied value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Based upon the goodwill impairment review completed in conjunction with the preparation of the annual financial statements at the end of fiscal 2015, which incorporates management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions, it was determined that the fair value of goodwill for each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
100378_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2015 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Management Estimates --The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Out-of-Period Adjustments --During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company recorded out-of-period adjustments related to the correction of errors identified late in the year-end closing process of fiscal 2013 that were deemed immaterial for adjustment to the fiscal 2013 financial statements.
100378_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	The impact of these corrections to the fiscal 2014 first quarter and full year results was to increase earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest by $437,000 and increase net earnings attributable to Twin Disc by $69,000 (after considering applicable tax effects).
100378_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	The nature of these errors is as follows:
100378_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company had over accrued for certain payroll related items totaling $337,000 as of June 30, 2013, resulting in an increase to earnings from operations.
100378_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company determined that work-in-process inventory had been overstated by $117,000 as of June 30, 2013.
100378_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	As a result, additional cost of goods sold was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, resulting in a decrease to earnings from operations.
100378_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company does not believe these errors were material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors was material to the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment for the correction of an error related to tax expense.
100378_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	More specifically, the Company understated tax expense by $175,000 for the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The impact of the correction of this error was to decrease net earnings by $175,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors was material to the year ended June 30, 2015, or any of the quarters therein.
100378_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error related to an understatement of its accrued retirement benefits for certain of its international benefit plans that contain minimum guarantees of approximately $470,000.
100378_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	The impact of this correction was to increase comprehensive loss by $470,000.
100378_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of this error is material to the year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance intended to amend current presentation guidance by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.

100378_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	This revenue recognition guidance supersedes existing U.S. GAAP guidance, including most industry-specific guidance.
100378_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
100378_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The guidance identifies steps to apply in achieving this principle.
100378_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company s fiscal 2019).
100378_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the reporting for discontinued operations.
100378_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.

100378_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, substantially all of which is allocated to the manufacturing segment, for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
100378_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 and concluded these assets are not impaired.
100378_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	At June 30, the following acquired intangible assets have definite useful lives and are subject to amortization (in thousands):
100378_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Other intangibles consist of certain amortizable acquisition costs, proprietary technology, computer software, certain customer relationships and debt issuance costs on the 6.05% notes.
100378_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company committed to a plan and entered negotiations to exit the distribution agreement and sell the inventory of its Italian distributor back to the parent supplier.
100378_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	This decision triggered an impairment review of the long lived assets at this entity, resulting in an impairment charge of $1,405,000, representing a complete impairment of the remaining intangibles ($1,277,000) and fixed assets ($128,000) for this entity.
100378_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	The impairment charge was determined by deriving the fair value of the asset group utilizing a discounted cash flow model.
100378_15_ITEM15_P70_S3	Significant inputs to this model include the discount rate, sales projections and profitability estimates.
100378_15_ITEM15_P70_S4	These inputs would be considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
100378_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets included in the table above is approximately 16 years.
100378_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	Intangible amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $239,000, $477,000 and $718,000, respectively.

100378_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	These assets are comprised of acquired tradenames.
100378_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Accrued liabilities at June 30 were as follows (in thousands):
100378_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company warrants all assembled products, parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) and service against defective materials or workmanship.
100378_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
100378_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers.
100378_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation.
100378_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	The warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
100378_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends.

100378_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date hereof (the Report ), I, Jeffrey S. Knutson, Vice President - Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	the information contained in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the commercial, pleasure craft, and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company s worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_16_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company s products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations, particularly in Europe, are taken mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company s products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 46% of the Company s consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	There were two customers, Sewart Supply, Inc. and Great Lakes Power Companies, both authorized distributors of the Company, that each accounted for 12% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016.
100378_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $35.7 million at June 30, 2016 compares to $34.4 million at June 30, 2015.
100378_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
100378_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $1.8 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $9.5 million, $11.1 million and $10.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2016 was 742.
100378_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	d ollar and the e uro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar or euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While the long-term impacts of the United Kingdom s vote to exit the European Union (commonly known as Brexit ) are currently unknown, any resulting unfavorable currency impact to the euro could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company s profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors c ould have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company s customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its growing needs.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company s future profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although there were only two customers, Sewart Supply, Inc. and Great Lakes Power Companies, that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 54% of the Company s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, India and Switzerland.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, Belgium, India and Canada.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Company s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These factors could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2016 s sales, came from its facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Any failure to meet debt obligations and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s new five-year revolving credit facility entered into in April 2016 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Under this agreement, the Company s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient borrowing base at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note G of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2017 in order to maintain compliance with this borrowing base.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company recorded a significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2016.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Company carries a remaining balance of goodwill in the amount of $5.1 million as of June 30, 2016 after the impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any further deterioration in the industry or business may trigger future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect to our financial results.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce the Company s net deferred tax assets.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company s effective tax rate.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on its networks.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company s operations and business strategy.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Despite the Company s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure, and that of its partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Any such breach or operational failure would compromise the Company s networks and/or that of its partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
100378_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company s operations, damage its reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in its products and services, which could adversely affect its business.
100378_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns two manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S.A., one in Nivelles, Belgium, two in Decima, Italy and one in Novazzano, Switzerland.
100378_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate floor space of these six plants approximates 767,000 square feet.
100378_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	One of the Racine facilities includes office space, which includes the Company s corporate headquarters.
100378_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company leases additional manufacturing, assembly and office facilities in Italy (Limite sull Arno) and India (manufacturing facility in Kancheepuram).
100378_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Distribution Segment The Company also has operations in the following locations, all of which are leased and are used for sales offices, warehousing and light assembly or product service:
100378_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes its properties are well maintained and adequate for its present and anticipated needs.

100378_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodities and foreign currency exchange rates.

100378_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
100378_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Discussion of the Company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to a Eurodollar rate.
100378_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	In accordance with BMO Agreement expiring April 22, 2021, the Company has the option of borrowing at a Eurodollar Rate plus an additional Add-On of 1.75%.
100378_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Due to the relative stability of interest rates, the Company did not utilize any financial instruments at June 30, 2016 to manage interest rate risk exposure.
100378_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	A 10 percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately $19,000.
100378_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Commodity price risk - The Company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum.
100378_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure.

100378_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Currency risk - The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
100378_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Approximately 29 percent of the Company s revenues in the year ended June 30, 2016 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
100378_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Of that total, approximately 62 percent was denominated in euros with the balance comprised of Japanese yen, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and the Australian and Singapore dollars.
100378_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	The Company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
100378_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity.
100378_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the currency fluctuations on significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
100378_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Derivative financial instruments - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury department and restrict derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was the euro.
100378_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.

100378_16_ITEM15_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Twin Disc, Incorporated:
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9(a).
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
100378_16_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	As discussed in Note A and Note N to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred income taxes in fiscal 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_16_ITEM15_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
100378_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
100378_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_16_ITEM15_P14_S2	The Company also has a controlling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_16_ITEM15_P14_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_16_ITEM15_P16_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in equity.
100378_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_16_ITEM15_P16_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction (losses) gains of ($320), $491 and $293 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Cash --The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalent.
100378_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	Under the Company s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment.
100378_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	To the extent that checks issued, but not yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable.
100378_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	Receivables --Trade accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,824 and $2,183 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable.
100378_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term borrowings approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_16_ITEM15_P20_S2	The fair value of the Company s 6.05% Senior Notes due April 10, 2016 was approximately $3,726 at June 30, 2015.
100378_16_ITEM15_P20_S3	The Senior Notes were paid off in full on April 10, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The fair value of the Senior Notes was estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
100378_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	This rate was represented by the U.S. Treasury Three-Year Yield Curve Rate (1.01% for fiscal 2015), plus the add-on related to the Company s revolving loan agreement (1.00% for fiscal 2015), outstanding at the time, resulting in a total rate of 2.01% for fiscal 2015.
100378_16_ITEM15_P21_S2	See Note G, Debt for the related book value of this debt instrument.
100378_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company s revolving loan agreement, which consists of loans of a short-term nature, as they are routinely borrowed and repaid throughout the year, approximates fair value at June 30, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury department and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was the euro.
100378_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts.
100378_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
100378_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	In fiscal 2016, the Company determined that sufficient impairment indicators existed at its U.S. manufacturing and European propulsion operations.
100378_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test on those long-lived assets as of June 30, 2016, and concluded that there was no impairment.
100378_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles -- Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired.
100378_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Impairment of goodwill is measured according to a two step approach.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; the fair value determined is also compared to the value obtained using a market approach from guideline public company multiples.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S3	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S4	In the second step, the implied value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of all other tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit.
100378_16_ITEM15_P37_S5	If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
100378_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2016 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for all of the Company s reporting units.
100378_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	As further described in Note D, the assessment resulted in the Company recognizing a goodwill impairment charge of $7,602.
100378_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2016 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	As of June 30, 2016, the Company elected to early adopt the FASB guidance requiring that deferred income tax assets and liabilities, by jurisdiction, be presented in the balance sheet as noncurrent classification.
100378_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 reflects the early adoption of this new accounting policy.
100378_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company chose not to retrospectively adjust prior periods.
100378_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Out-of-Period Adjustments --During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company recorded out-of-period adjustments related to the correction of errors identified late in the year-end closing process of fiscal 2013 that were deemed immaterial for adjustment to the fiscal 2013 financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	The impact of these corrections to the fiscal 2014 first quarter and full year results was to increase earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest by $437 and increase net earnings attributable to Twin Disc by $69 (after considering applicable tax effects).
100378_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	The nature of these errors is as follows:
100378_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company had over accrued for certain payroll related items totaling $337 as of June 30, 2013, resulting in an increase to earnings from operations.
100378_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company had overstated its warranty accrual by $217 as of June 30, 2013, resulting in an increase to earnings from operations.
100378_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company determined that work-in-process inventory had been overstated by $117 as of June 30, 2013.
100378_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	As a result, additional cost of goods sold was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, resulting in a decrease to earnings from operations.
100378_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company s deferred tax liabilities were understated by $285 as of June 30, 2013, resulting in additional tax expense.
100378_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company does not believe these errors were material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors was material to the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment for the correction of an error related to tax expense.
100378_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	More specifically, the Company understated tax expense by $175 for the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The impact of the correction of this error was to decrease net earnings by $175 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors was material to the year ended June 30, 2015, or any of the quarters therein.
100378_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error related to an understatement of its accrued retirement benefits for certain of its international benefit plans that contain minimum return guarantees of approximately $470.
100378_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The impact of this correction was to increase comprehensive loss by $470.
100378_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of this error is material to the year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued updated guidance to the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
100378_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted.
100378_16_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which replaces the existing guidance for leases.
100378_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
100378_16_ITEM15_P60_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
100378_16_ITEM15_P60_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (the Company s fiscal 2020), including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires retrospective application.
100378_16_ITEM15_P60_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify current presentation guidance by requiring that deferred income tax assets and liabilities, by jurisdiction, be presented in the balance sheet as noncurrent.
100378_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted.
100378_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 reflects this early adoption.
100378_16_ITEM15_P61_S4	This guidance was adopted prospectively and therefore prior year periods were not revised.
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify the measurement of inventory and to closely align with International Financial Reporting Standards.
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	Current guidance requires inventories to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	Under this new guidance, inventories other than those measured under LIFO are to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S4	This guidance is to be applied prospectively, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018).
100378_16_ITEM15_P62_S5	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance to reduce complexity in employee benefit plan accounting, which is consistent with its Simplification Initiative of improving areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements.
100378_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	This guidance update consists of several parts that affect the reporting of defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, and their fair value measurements, among others.
100378_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company s fiscal 2017).
100378_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to amend current presentation guidance by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
100378_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	With regard to debt issuance costs in connection with line-of-credit arrangements, they are to be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement.
100378_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company s fiscal 2017).
100378_16_ITEM15_P64_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern.
100378_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2017), and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued stock compensation guidance requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
100378_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company s fiscal 2017).
100378_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on revenue from contracts with customers.
100378_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	This revenue recognition guidance supersedes existing U.S. GAAP guidance, including most industry-specific guidance.
100378_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
100378_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	The guidance identifies steps to apply in achieving this principle.
100378_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company s fiscal 2019).
100378_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	The major classes of inventories at June 30 were as follows:
100378_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 33% and 28% of total inventories at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $26,451 and $26,816 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $8,823 and $8,167 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Property, plant and equipment at June 30 were as follows:
100378_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $8,682, $9,922 and $10,180, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually as of the end of the fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
100378_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Goodwill recorded in the following reporting units was evaluated:
100378_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process.
100378_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	In step one, the fair value of each of the reporting units is compared to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
100378_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required.
100378_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, step two of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
100378_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	In step two of the test, the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities (both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) are measured in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , in a hypothetical purchase transaction and compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
100378_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	If the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
100378_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	The fair value of reporting units is primarily driven by projected growth rates and operating results under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model, which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate, and consideration of other market approach data from guideline public companies.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company experienced sustained declines in operating results across the business during fiscal 2016, which resulted from weak market trends in the Company s global oil and gas and commercial marine markets, an underperforming European economy, and few signs of significant near-term recovery in the markets served by these reporting units.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2016 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for all of the Company s reporting units, which had increased from the prior year to 13.1% for the U.S. Industrial business as a result of the macroeconomic trends and the Company s forecasted cash flows.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	The assessment resulted in the U.S. Industrial and European Propulsion reporting units failing step one of the impairment test.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	The Company then performed step two testing for each of the reporting units.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S4	The conclusions were that the U.S. Industrial reporting unit required an impairment charge of $6,391, and the European Propulsion reporting unit required a full impairment charge of $1,211.
100378_16_ITEM15_P77_S5	The fair value of the European Industrial reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 31% and therefore no impairment charge was required for this reporting unit.
100378_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	The total non-cash impairment charge of $7,602 does not result in any future cash expenditures, impact liquidity, affect the ongoing business or financial performance of the Company, impact compliance with our lending arrangements, or reduce borrowing capacity.
100378_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	As of June 30, 2016, goodwill is carried in the following reporting units:

100378_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	International commingled funds are valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) as determined by the custodian of the fund.
100378_16_ITEM15_P178_S1	The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding.

100378_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
100378_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company sponsors defined contribution plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees.
100378_16_ITEM15_P186_S1	These plans provide for employer contributions based primarily on employee participation.
100378_16_ITEM15_P186_S2	The total expense under the plans was $2,058, $2,526 and $2,218 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

100378_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes is comprised of the following:
100378_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	The components of the net deferred tax asset as of June 30 are summarized in the table below.
100378_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	As of June 30, 2016, due to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, all deferred tax assets and liabilities have been classified as noncurrent.
100378_16_ITEM15_P190_S1	The Company elected to adopt this guidance prospectively and not revise prior periods.
100378_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	As of June 30, 2015, $4,863 of deferred tax assets is presented as a current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and $82 of deferred tax liabilities is included in accrued liabilities.
100378_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
100378_16_ITEM15_P192_S1	Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.
100378_16_ITEM15_P192_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	During fiscal 2016, the Company reported operating income in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_16_ITEM15_P193_S1	The Company has evaluated the likelihood of whether the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions would be realized and concluded that based primarily upon the uncertainty to achieve levels of sustained improvement and uncertain exchange rates in these jurisdictions; (a) it is more likely than not that $3,123 of deferred tax assets would not be realized; and that (b) a full valuation allowance on the balance of deferred tax assets relating to these jurisdictions continues to be necessary.
100378_16_ITEM15_P193_S2	The Company recorded a net decrease in valuation allowance of $454 in fiscal 2016 due to lower cumulative operating losses in these jurisdictions.
100378_16_ITEM15_P193_S3	Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets.
100378_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	Following is a reconciliation of the applicable U.S. federal income taxes to the actual income taxes reflected in the statements of operations:
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company has not provided additional U.S. income taxes on cumulative earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S1	The Company reaffirms its position that these earnings remain permanently invested, and has no plans to repatriate funds to the U.S. for the foreseeable future.
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S2	These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $3,039 at June 30, 2016.
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S4	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on such earnings.
100378_16_ITEM15_P195_S5	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
100378_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	Annually, we file income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States.
100378_16_ITEM15_P196_S1	In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2012 through 2016 for our major operations in Italy, Belgium and Japan.
100378_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	The tax years open to examination in the U.S. are for years subsequent to fiscal 2013.
100378_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Company has approximately $790 of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate.
100378_16_ITEM15_P198_S1	During the fiscal year the amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased primarily due to expiration of statutes.
100378_16_ITEM15_P198_S2	During the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits.
100378_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
100378_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	Below is a reconciliation of beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:
100378_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	Substantially all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 3016, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
100378_16_ITEM15_P201_S1	As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $61 and $62, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
100378_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_16_ITEM15_P202_S1	Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, either individually or in the aggregate.
100378_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	In response to challenging global market conditions within the Company s oil and gas, global pleasure craft and commercial marine markets, the Company undertook a series of restructuring actions starting in late fiscal 2015 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which primarily involved the elimination of several full-time positions at its operations primarily in the U.S., Italy, and Singapore.
100378_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	These actions resulted in a pre-tax restructuring charge of $921 and $3,282 in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_16_ITEM15_P203_S2	During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $961 to further reduce headcount relating to actions that were initiated in fiscal 2013 in our Belgium operations.

100378_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	Provided that he/she serves at least one complete three-year term, an outside Director who retires from the Board, resigns from the Board, or decides not to stand for re-election to the Board (i.e. reaches retirement ) shall be entitled to annual retirement pay equal to the cash portion of the annual Director s retainer (exclusive of any committee chair fees) last paid to the Director prior to his/her retirement.
100378_16_ITEM15_P215_S0	Retirement payments shall be payable quarterly, between the first and fifteenth days of each December, March, June and September (commencing on the first such quarterly date following the effective date of retirement), and shall continue for the number of quarters equivalent to the period of his/her service as a Director or until his/her death, whichever occurs first.

Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_16_ITEM15_P230_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_16_ITEM15_P231_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date hereof (the Report ), I, Jeffrey S. Knutson, Vice President - Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_16_ITEM15_P232_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc, Incorporated ( Twin Disc , or the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the commercial, pleasure craft, and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_17_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in Europe, occur mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 48% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	There was one customer, Great Lakes Power Companies, an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 11% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017.
100378_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $46.4 million at June 30, 2017 compares to $35.7 million at June 30, 2016.
100378_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
100378_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $1.5 million, $1.8 million and $2.3 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $8.9 million, $9.5 million and $11.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2017 was 672.
100378_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	A summary of financial data by segment and geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	d ollar and the e uro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar or euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While the long-term impacts of the United Kingdom s vote to exit the European Union (commonly known as Brexit ) are currently unknown, any resulting unfavorable currency impact to the euro could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company s profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors c ould have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, gov ernment and industrial markets.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its growing needs.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company s future profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although there was only one customer, Great Lakes Power Companies, that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 51% of the Company s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, Belgium, India and Canada.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Company s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These factors could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2017 sales, came from its facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Any failure to meet debt obligations and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s five-year revolving credit facility entered into in April 2016 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Under this agreement, the Company s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient borrowing base at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As of June 30, 2017, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note G of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2018 in order to maintain compliance with this borrowing base.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company recorded significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge s in fiscal 201 7 and 2016 .
100378_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Company carries a remaining balance of goodwill in the amount of $2.6 million as of June 30, 2017 after the impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any further deterioration in the industry or business may trigger future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect to our financial results.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce the Company s net deferred tax assets.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company s effective tax rate.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.
100378_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.

100378_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to a Eurodollar rate.

100378_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was the euro.

100378_17_ITEM15_P5_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_17_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
100378_17_ITEM15_P5_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_17_ITEM15_P5_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

100378_17_ITEM15_P5_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
100378_17_ITEM15_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_17_ITEM15_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

100378_17_ITEM15_P13_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_17_ITEM15_P14_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in equity.
100378_17_ITEM15_P15_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_17_ITEM15_P15_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction (losses) gains of ($318), ($320) and $491 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	Cash --The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalent.
100378_17_ITEM15_P16_S1	Under the Company s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment.
100378_17_ITEM15_P16_S2	To the extent that checks issued, but not yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable.
100378_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	Accounts Receivable --These represent trade accounts receivable and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,519 and $1,824 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable.
100378_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_17_ITEM15_P18_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_17_ITEM15_P18_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company s borrowings under the revolving loan agreement, which is classified as long-term debt and consists of loans that are routinely borrowed and repaid throughout the year, approximate fair value at June 30, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including any current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury department and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_17_ITEM15_P21_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was the euro.
100378_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	At June 30, 2017, one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries had three outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in the notional value of $1,050 with a weighted average maturity of 53 days.
100378_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	The fair value of the Company s contract was a loss of $29 at June 30, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts at June 30, 2016.
100378_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
100378_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_17_ITEM15_P28_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
100378_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_17_ITEM15_P31_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_17_ITEM15_P31_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles --Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired.
100378_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company early-adopted the new goodwill guidance, ASU 2017-04, during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	Under the new guidance, the goodwill impairment process has been simplified to a one-step approach.
100378_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	The fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses which is driven by projected growth rates, and which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate; the fair value determined is also compared to the value obtained using a market approach from guideline public company multiples.
100378_17_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, that difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
100378_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company conducted interim qualitative assessments throughout the year, and its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for the Company s reporting units.
100378_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	As further described in Note D, these assessments resulted in the Company recognizing goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016.
100378_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2017 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Deferred Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	As more fully discussed in Recently Issued Accounting Standards, the Company expects to adopt ASU 2014-09 in fiscal 2019.
100378_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	Under the new guidance, the Company s timing of recognizing revenue may change.
100378_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Out-of-Period Adjustments --During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment for the correction of an error related to tax expense.
100378_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	More specifically, the Company understated tax expense by $175 for the year ended June 30, 2014.
100378_17_ITEM15_P48_S2	The impact of the correction of this error was to decrease net earnings by $175 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_17_ITEM15_P48_S3	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of these errors was material to the year ended June 30, 2015, or any of the quarters therein.
100378_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error related to an understatement of its accrued retirement benefits for certain of its international benefit plans that contain minimum return guarantees of approximately $470.
100378_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	The impact of this correction was to increase comprehensive loss by $470.
100378_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company does not believe this error is material to its financial statements for any prior period, nor that the correction of this error is material to the year ended June 30, 2015.
100378_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance (ASU 2017-07) intended to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost.
100378_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	This guidance requires that an employer report the service costs component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
100378_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations.
100378_17_ITEM15_P50_S3	The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, (the Company s fiscal 2019), with early adoption permitted.
100378_17_ITEM15_P50_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016-16) that changes the recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory.
100378_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company s fiscal 2019), with early adoption permitted.
100378_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016-15) that addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
100378_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company s fiscal 2019), with early adoption permitted.
100378_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016-09) intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
100378_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted.
100378_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2016-02) which replaces the existing guidance for leases.
100378_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
100378_17_ITEM15_P54_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
100378_17_ITEM15_P54_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (the Company s fiscal 2020), including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires retrospective application.
100378_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	In preparation for the adoption of this guidance, the Company gathered all active lease contracts from all its locations to assess whether or not they meet the definition of a lease under the new guidance, specifically, whether there is an identified asset in the contract, and whether or not control thereof lies with the Company.
100378_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company assessed the practical expedients that are allowed under the guidance, including the exclusion of lease contracts with terms of twelve months or less.
100378_17_ITEM15_P55_S2	It assessed each contract for the appropriate lease payment components, discount rate, lease terms (dependent on renewal options) and compiled a preliminary calculation of the right-of-use assets and operating lease liability amounts that would be recognized on the Company s balance sheet upon adoption of the guidance.
100378_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company is continuing its assessment, including the potential operational process changes as a result of the new guidance.
100378_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	It plans to early-adopt the guidance, using the modified retrospective approach, to coincide with its adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
100378_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2015-11) intended to simplify the measurement of inventory and to closely align with International Financial Reporting Standards.
100378_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	Current guidance requires inventories to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
100378_17_ITEM15_P57_S2	Under this new guidance, inventories other than those measured under last in first out ( LIFO ) are to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
100378_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
100378_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	This guidance is to be applied prospectively, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2018).
100378_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2014-15) intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern.
100378_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal 2017), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
100378_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company adopted this guidance as of June 30, 2017 and it did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2014-09) on revenue from contracts with customers.
100378_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	This revenue recognition guidance supersedes existing guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
100378_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control over promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
100378_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The guidance identifies steps to apply in achieving this principle.
100378_17_ITEM15_P61_S2	This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2019).
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	In preparation for the adoption of this guidance, the Company gathered customer contracts and customer purchase orders of its various locations to assess whether there are separate and distinct performance obligations, as defined by ASU 2014-09, within these agreements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	The assessment has included interviews with various functions, including sales, engineering, customer service, and finance, to further analyze those performance obligations, both explicit and implicit (particularly as they relate to services).
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	Under this ASU, revenue is recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S3	Based upon the preliminary findings, the Company has identified indicators that suggest a deferral of revenue may be required for certain agreements where the performance of services after product delivery may be required.
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S4	In certain agreements where the products are built to customer specifications, revenue may need to be accelerated.
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S5	The Company is continuing its assessment, including whether or not these obligations are perfunctory or material to the financial statements.
100378_17_ITEM15_P62_S6	It plans to adopt the guidance on the effective date applicable to the Company, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
100378_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	There are two transition methods available under the new standard, either full retrospective or modified retrospective.
100378_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company has not yet determined which transition method it will use.
100378_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	The major classes of inventories at June 30 were as follows:
100378_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 36% and 33% of total inventories at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $26,422 and $26,451 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P65_S2	The Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $9,068 and $8,823 at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	C. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment at June 30 were as follows:
100378_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $6,849, $8,682 and $9,922, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually as of the end of the fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
100378_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	As of June 30, 2016, the goodwill impairment test involved a two-step process.
100378_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	In step one, the fair value of each of the reporting units is compared to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
100378_17_ITEM15_P69_S2	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required.
100378_17_ITEM15_P69_S3	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, step two of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
100378_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	In step two of the test, the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities (both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) are measured in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , in a hypothetical purchase transaction and compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
100378_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	If the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
100378_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	The fair value of reporting units is primarily driven by projected growth rates and operating results under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model, which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate, and consideration of other market approach data from guideline public companies.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company experienced sustained declines in operating results across the business during fiscal 2016, which resulted from weak market trends in the Company s global oil and gas and commercial marine markets, an underperforming European economy, and few signs of significant near-term recovery in the markets served by these reporting units.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2016 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for all of the Company s reporting units, which had increased from the prior year to 13.1% for the U.S. Industrial business as a result of the macroeconomic trends and the Company s forecasted cash flows.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S2	The assessment resulted in the U.S. Industrial and European Propulsion reporting units failing step one of the impairment test.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company then performed step two testing for each of the reporting units.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S4	The conclusions were that the U.S. Industrial reporting unit required an impairment charge of $6,391, and the European Propulsion reporting unit required a full impairment charge of $1,211.
100378_17_ITEM15_P72_S5	The fair value of the European Industrial reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 31% and therefore no impairment charge was required for this reporting unit.
100378_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company early-adopted the new goodwill guidance, ASU 2017-04.
100378_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	Under the new guidance, the goodwill impairment process has been simplified to a one-step approach.
100378_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	The fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses which is driven by projected growth rates, and which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate; this fair value determined under the income approach is also compared to the value obtained using a market approach from guideline public company multiples.
100378_17_ITEM15_P74_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, that difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
100378_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	The fair value of reporting units is primarily driven by projected growth rates and operating results under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model, which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate, and consideration of other market approach data from guideline public companies.
100378_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	If declining actual operating results or future operating results become indicative that the fair value of the Company s reporting units has declined below their carrying values, an interim goodwill impairment test may need to be performed and may result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
100378_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	If the Company s market capitalization falls below the Company s carrying value for a sustained period of time or if such a decline becomes indicative that the fair value of the Company s reporting units has declined to below their carrying values, an interim goodwill impairment test may need to be performed and may result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
100378_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company performed a review of potential triggering events, and concluded there were no triggering events that indicated that the fair value of its European Industrial reporting unit had declined to below its carrying value at March 31, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	However, as the review pertained to its U.S. Industrial reporting unit, the Company concluded that events have occurred during the quarter that were indicative that the fair value of the U.S. Industrial reporting unit had more likely than not declined to below its carrying value at March 31, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P76_S2	Such events included the decline in the industry outlook, as well as the underperformance of this reporting unit relative to its forecasted sales and prior period performance.
100378_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	In accordance with ASU 2017-04, the Company performed an impairment test using current assumptions, including updated forecasted cash flows and a company specific discount rate of 13.1%, for the U.S. Industrial reporting unit and concluded that it required an impairment charge of $2,550 to fully write off its remaining goodwill balance.
100378_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are summarized as follows:
100378_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	The total non-cash impairment charges of $2,550 and $7,602 in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, do not result in any future cash expenditures, impact liquidity, affect the ongoing business or financial performance of the Company, impact compliance with our lending arrangements, or reduce borrowing capacity.
100378_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	As at June 30, 2017, the balance of goodwill of $2,585 is carried in the European Industrial reporting unit.
100378_17_ITEM15_P80_S1	The fair value of the European Industrial reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 57% and therefore no impairment charge was required for this reporting unit.
100378_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	At June 30, the following acquired intangible assets have definite useful lives and are subject to amortization:
100378_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	Other intangibles consist of certain amortizable acquisition costs, proprietary technology, computer software and certain customer relationships.

100378_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	Accrued liabilities at June 30 were as follows:
100378_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company warrants all assembled products, parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) and service against defective materials or workmanship.
100378_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
100378_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers.
100378_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation.
100378_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	The warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
100378_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends.
100378_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	While we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires.
100378_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	The following is a listing of the activity in the warranty reserve during the years ended June 30:
100378_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The current portion of the warranty accrual ($1,708 and $2,532 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively) is reflected in accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion ($354 and $1,075 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively) is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

100378_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The BMO Agreement provides for a borrowing base calculation to determine borrowing capacity.
100378_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	This capacity will be based upon eligible domestic inventory, eligible accounts receivable and machinery and equipment, subject to certain adjustments.
100378_17_ITEM15_P95_S2	As of June 30, 2017, the Company s borrowing capacity under the terms of the BMO Agreement was approximately $28,580, and the Company had approximately $21,365 of available borrowings.

100378_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	(a) Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
100378_17_ITEM15_P166_S1	These securities include U.S. equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges inside the U.S. and international equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges outside the U.S.
100378_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	(b) Mutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund.
100378_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	Mutual funds held by the Company s funded benefit plans are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities Exchange Commission.
100378_17_ITEM15_P168_S1	These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value ( NAV ) and to transact at that price.
100378_17_ITEM15_P168_S2	The mutual funds held by the Company s funded benefit plans are deemed to be actively traded.
100378_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	(c) Annuity contracts represent contractual agreements in which payments are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or lump sum amount at a later date.
100378_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	Annuity contracts are valued at the net present value of future cash flows.
100378_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	(d) In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

100378_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	United States and foreign earnings before income taxes and minority interest were as follows:
100378_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes is comprised of the following:
100378_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	The components of the net deferred tax asset as of June 30 are summarized in the table below.
100378_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
100378_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.
100378_17_ITEM15_P180_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company reported operating income in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	The Company has evaluated the likelihood of whether the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions would be realized and concluded that based primarily upon the uncertainty to achieve levels of sustained improvement and uncertain exchange rates in these jurisdictions; (a) it is more likely than not that $3,803 of deferred tax assets would not be realized; and that (b) a full valuation allowance on the balance of deferred tax assets relating to these jurisdictions continues to be necessary.
100378_17_ITEM15_P181_S2	The Company recorded a net increase in valuation allowance of $680 in fiscal 2017 due to higher cumulative operating losses in these jurisdictions.
100378_17_ITEM15_P181_S3	Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets.
100378_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	Following is a reconciliation of the applicable U.S. federal income taxes to the actual income taxes reflected in the statements of operations:
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company has not provided additional U.S. income taxes on cumulative earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S1	The Company reaffirms its position that these earnings remain permanently invested, and has no plans to repatriate funds to the U.S. for the foreseeable future.
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S2	These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $3,667 at June 30, 2017.
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S4	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on such earnings.
100378_17_ITEM15_P183_S5	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
100378_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	Annually, the Company files income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States.
100378_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2013 through 2017 for our major operations in Italy, Belgium and Japan.
100378_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	The tax years open to examination in the U.S. are for years subsequent to fiscal 2013.
100378_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company has approximately $827 of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate.
100378_17_ITEM15_P186_S1	During the fiscal year the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to reserves established for the current year.
100378_17_ITEM15_P186_S2	During the next twelve months, the Company anticipates closure of the Internal Revenue Service audit of fiscal year 2015.
100378_17_ITEM15_P186_S3	This could result in a significant change to the unrecognized tax benefits.
100378_17_ITEM15_P186_S4	The Company s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
100378_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	Below is a reconciliation of beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:
100378_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Substantially all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 3017, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
100378_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $94 and $61, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
100378_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, either individually or in the aggregate.
100378_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	In response to challenging global market conditions within the Company s oil and gas, global pleasure craft and commercial marine markets, the Company undertook a series of restructuring actions starting in late fiscal 2015, and continuing into the current fiscal year.
100378_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	In March 2017, the Company formally commenced the exit from its India manufacturing operations by announcing the closure of its India factory.
100378_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	Exit activities include the involuntary termination of its factory employees, termination of leased facilities, and sale and/or disposal of certain plant equipment.
100378_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	As a result of these activities, an asset impairment charge of $96 is included in the statement of operations.
100378_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company implemented additional restructuring activities, which primarily involved the reduction of workforce in its U.S., Belgian, and Italian manufacturing operations under a combination of voluntary and involuntary separation programs.
100378_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	These actions resulted in the elimination of 158 full-time employees in the manufacturing segment since June 2015.
100378_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	These actions resulted in a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1,791, $921 and $3,282 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
100378_17_ITEM15_P192_S3	Accumulated costs to date under these programs within the manufacturing segment through June 30, 2017 were $5,875.
100378_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	The following is a roll-forward of restructuring activity:
100378_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	During fiscal 2016, as part of its initiative to focus resources on core manufacturing and product development activities aimed at improving profitability, the Company sold one of its distribution entities in the U.S.
100378_17_ITEM15_P194_S1	The proceeds of $4,100 represent the sale of distribution rights to its southeastern U.S. territories, amounting to $600, and certain assets, consisting primarily of inventories, for $3,500.
100378_17_ITEM15_P194_S2	The gain on sale of $445 is recorded as other operating income in the statement of operations.

100378_17_ITEM15_P213_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date hereof (the Report ), I, Jeffrey S. Knutson, Vice President - Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to the best of my knowledge:
100378_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
100378_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Twin Disc, Incorporated ( Twin Disc , or the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918.
100378_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment.
100378_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	Products offered include: marine transmissions, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems.
100378_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the commercial, pleasure craft, and military marine markets as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Company s worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
100378_18_ITEM1_P1_S4	The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
100378_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Most of the Company s products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
100378_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable.
100378_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
100378_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in Europe, occur mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
100378_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company s products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers.
100378_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers.
100378_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	The primary competitive factors for the Company s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability.
100378_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	The Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 57% of the Company s consolidated net sales during the year ended June 30, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	There was one customer, Palmer Johnson Power Systems, LLC, an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018.
100378_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $115.0 million at June 30, 2018 compares to $46.4 million at June 30, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog.
100378_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, as procurement and manufacturing lead times change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate.
100378_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
100378_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries.
100378_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	No material portion of the Company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
100378_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products.
100378_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $1.6 million, $1.5 million and $1.8 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	Total engineering and development costs were $9.9 million, $8.9 million and $9.5 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
100378_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2018 was 696.
100378_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	A summary of financial data by segment, geographic area, and classes of products that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales revenues for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 appears in Note J to the consolidated financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company s internet website address is www.twindisc.com.
100378_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor s own internet access charges) through its website the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
100378_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials.
100378_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	This information is also available from the Company upon request.
100378_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business involves risk.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company s business.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a global company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	d ollar and the e uro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar or euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While the long-term impacts of the United Kingdom s vote to exit the European Union (commonly known as Brexit ) are currently unknown, any resulting unfavorable currency impact to the euro could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of the Company s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company s profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company s profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of the Company s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors c ould have a material adverse effect on the Company s overall financial performance .
100378_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company s customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its growing needs.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability .
100378_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, recent developments in tariff regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have resulted in uncertainty regarding international trade policies and future commodity prices, contributing to an increased risk of higher commodity costs that could have an adverse impact on the Company s profitability , financial condition and results of operations .
100378_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s profitability is dependent, in part, on commodity costs.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company s future profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The current United States administration has signaled support for implementing, and in some instances, has already proposed or taken action with respect to, major changes to certain trade policies, such as the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products and the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	On March 8, 2018, the President of the United States signed an order to impose a tariff of 25% on steel imported from certain countries.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	On July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including steel.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The Company anticipates that the tariff could result in an increase in its cost of sales and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass any of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariff to its customers.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, there could be additional tariffs imposed by the United States and these could also result in additional retaliatory actions by the United States trade partners.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Given that it procures many of the raw materials that it uses to create its products directly or indirectly from outside of the United States, the imposition of tariffs and other potential changes in U.S. trade policy could increase the cost or limit the availability of such raw materials, which could hurt its competitive position and adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In addition, the Company sells a significant proportion of its products to customers outside of the United States.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Retaliatory actions by other countries could result in increases in the price of its products, which could limit demand for such products, hurt its global competitive position and have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company s business would be adversely affected.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although there was only one customer, Palmer Johnson Power Systems, LLC, that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The termination of relationships with the Company s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company s profitability and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company s products is one of its competitive advantages.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 41% of the Company s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, Belgium, India and Canada.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Company s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
100378_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	These factors could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A material disruption at the Company s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The majority of the Company s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2018 sales, came from its facilities in Racine, Wisconsin.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Any failure to meet debt obligations and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s five-year revolving credit facility entered into on June 29, 2018 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Under this agreement, the Company s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient borrowing base at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As of June 30, 2018, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note G of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2019 in order to maintain compliance with this borrowing base.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition of Veth Propulsion in its forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company has made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of synergies and associated costs of the acquisition of Veth Propulsion.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such assumptions may be inaccurate based on the information available to the Company or as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, higher than expected integration costs, unknown liabilities and global economic and business conditions that may adversely affect the combined company following the completion of the acquisition.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The combination of the businesses will require significant management attention, and the Company may incur significant additional integration costs because of integration difficulties and other challenges.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As part of the acquisition of Veth Propulsion, the Company entered into a new credit agreement and significantly increased its indebtedness.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The ability to service the requirements of the new debt depends on the ability to generate cash and/or refinance its indebtedness as it becomes due, and depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The Company s ability to make payments on its indebtedness, including those under the new credit agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate expenses depends on the Company s future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Many of these factors are beyond its control.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The Company cannot assure that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund its other operating requirements.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Significant delays in its planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect the Company s future revenue prospects.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As a result of the acquisition of Veth Propulsion, the Company will likely record a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, and it may never fully realize the full value of these assets.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The accounting for the acquisition, including the purchase price allocation is in progress.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The Company will likely record a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and developed technologies.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Impairment may result from, among other things, (i) a decrease in its expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in its common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) heightened competition; (viii) strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions; or (ix) a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In the event that it determines that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, it might have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company recorded significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge s in fiscal 201 7 and 2016 .
100378_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Company carries a remaining balance of goodwill in the amount of $2.7 million as of June 30, 2018 after impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Any further deterioration in the industry or business may trigger future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect to the Company s financial results.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
100378_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.

100378_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Interest rate risk - The Company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements of interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to a Eurodollar rate.

100378_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.

100378_18_ITEM15_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
100378_18_ITEM15_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

100378_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
100378_18_ITEM15_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

100378_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
100378_18_ITEM15_P13_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated August 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
100378_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
100378_18_ITEM15_P14_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P14_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
100378_18_ITEM15_P15_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
100378_18_ITEM15_P15_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
100378_18_ITEM15_P15_S2	Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
100378_18_ITEM15_P15_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P15_S4	Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

100378_18_ITEM15_P16_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Twin Disc, Incorporated:
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2017 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S4	We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
100378_18_ITEM15_P18_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
100378_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
100378_18_ITEM15_P19_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
100378_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
100378_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	Consolidation Principles --The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries (the Company ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Certain foreign subsidiaries are included based on fiscal years ending May 31, to facilitate prompt reporting of consolidated accounts.
100378_18_ITEM15_P25_S2	The Company also has a controlling interest in a Japanese joint venture, which is consolidated based upon a fiscal year ending March 31.
100378_18_ITEM15_P25_S3	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
100378_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
100378_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
100378_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies --The financial statements of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses.
100378_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in equity.
100378_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P27_S3	Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction losses of ( $198 ), ( $318 ) and ( $320 ) in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	Cash --The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalent.
100378_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	Under the Company s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment.
100378_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	To the extent that checks issued, but not yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable.
100378_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Accounts Receivable --These represent trade accounts receivable and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,478 and $1,519 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts provision for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable.
100378_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
100378_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Various factors may adversely impact our customer s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain.
100378_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
100378_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments --The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments .
100378_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company s borrowings under the revolving loan agreement, which is classified as long-term debt and consists of loans that are routinely borrowed and repaid throughout the year, approximate fair value at June 30, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including any current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note M.
100378_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments - - The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company s corporate treasury department and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes.
100378_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited.
100378_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company uses financial instruments to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.
100378_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	Periodically, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables.
100378_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates.
100378_18_ITEM15_P35_S2	Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.
100378_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions.
100378_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period.
100378_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was the euro.
100378_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts at June 30, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P37_S2	At June 30, 2017, one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries had three outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in the notional value of $1,050 with a weighted average maturity of 53 days.
100378_18_ITEM15_P37_S3	The fair value of the Company s contract was a loss of $29 at June 30, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	Inventories --Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
100378_18_ITEM15_P38_S1	(FIFO) method for all other inventories.
100378_18_ITEM15_P38_S2	Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
100378_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation --Assets are stated at cost.
100378_18_ITEM15_P39_S1	Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred.
100378_18_ITEM15_P39_S2	Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated.
100378_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
100378_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years.
100378_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
100378_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	Impairment of Long-lived Assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
100378_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	For property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
100378_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.
100378_18_ITEM15_P42_S3	Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations when necessary.
100378_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles --Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily tradenames, are tested for impairment at least annually on the last day of the Company s fiscal year and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the asset may be impaired.
100378_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	If applicable, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based upon the relative fair value of the asset to each reporting unit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.
100378_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.
100378_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company early-adopted the new goodwill guidance, ASU 2017 - 04, during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Under the new guidance, the goodwill impairment process has been simplified to a one -step approach.
100378_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	The fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
100378_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses which is driven by projected growth rates, and which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate; the fair value determined is also compared to the value obtained using a market approach from guideline public company multiples.
100378_18_ITEM15_P46_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, that difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
100378_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company conducted interim qualitative assessments throughout the year, and its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for the Company s reporting units.
100378_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	As further described in Note D, these assessments resulted in the Company recognizing a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The fair value of the Company s other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily tradenames, is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if the Company did not own the asset; and a discount rate.
100378_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	The Company completed the impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles as of June 30, 2018 and concluded there were no impairments.
100378_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, could result in an impairment charge in the future.
100378_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews as necessary.
100378_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Any cost incurred to extend or renew the term of an indefinite lived intangible asset are expensed as incurred.
100378_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	Income Taxes --The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
100378_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
100378_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions as new information becomes available.
100378_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	Tax benefits are recognized to the extent a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority.
100378_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	Revenue Recognition --Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and ownership has transferred to the customer; the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
100378_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped to the customer, except for certain domestic shipments to overseas customers where revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer.
100378_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated net sales is transacted through a third party distribution network.
100378_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	Sales to third party distributors are subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above.
100378_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience.
100378_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	As more fully discussed in Recently Issued Accounting Standards, the Company expects to adopt ASU 2014 - 09 in fiscal 2019.
100378_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Under the new guidance, the Company s timing of recognizing revenue will change; however, the impact has been determined to be insignificant.
100378_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales.
100378_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
100378_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance (ASU 2018 - 07 ) intended to simplify the accounting for share based payments granted to nonemployees.
100378_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	Under the amendments in this guidance, payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share based payments granted to employees.
100378_18_ITEM15_P60_S2	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, ( the Company s fiscal 2020 ), including interim periods within that fiscal year.
100378_18_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2018 - 02 ) intended to eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, ( the Company s fiscal 2020 ), with early adoption permitted.
100378_18_ITEM15_P61_S2	The Company has not decided when it will adopt this guidance; its adoption will have no impact to total shareholders equity.
100378_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2017 - 07 ) intended to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost.
100378_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	This guidance requires that an employer report the service costs component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
100378_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations.
100378_18_ITEM15_P62_S3	The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, ( the Company s fiscal 2019 ), with early adoption permitted.
100378_18_ITEM15_P62_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016 - 16 ) that changes the recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory.
100378_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 ( the Company s fiscal 2019 ), with early adoption permitted.
100378_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016 - 15 ) that addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
100378_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 ( the Company s fiscal 2019 ), with early adoption permitted.
100378_18_ITEM15_P64_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.
100378_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2016 - 09 ) intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
100378_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P65_S2	As a result of the adoption, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation award activity are recognized in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
100378_18_ITEM15_P65_S3	In addition, excess tax benefits associated with award activity is reported as cash flows from operating activities along with all other income tax cash flows.
100378_18_ITEM15_P65_S4	The Company has elected to apply this classification change on a prospective basis.
100378_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2016 - 02 ) which replaces the existing guidance for leases.
100378_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
100378_18_ITEM15_P67_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
100378_18_ITEM15_P67_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 ( the Company s fiscal 2020 ), including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires retrospective application.
100378_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	In preparation for the adoption of this guidance, the Company gathered all active lease contracts from all its locations to assess whether or not they meet the definition of a lease under the new guidance, specifically, whether there is an identified asset in the contract, and whether or not control thereof lies with the Company.
100378_18_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company assessed the practical expedients that are allowed under the guidance, including the exclusion of lease contracts with terms of twelve months or less.
100378_18_ITEM15_P68_S2	It assessed each contract for the appropriate lease payment components, discount rate, lease terms (dependent on renewal options) and compiled a calculation of the right-of-use assets and operating lease liability amounts that would be recognized on the Company s balance sheet upon adoption of the guidance.
100378_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	During the fiscal year, the Company concluded its assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its accounting practices, including the operational process changes.
100378_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	It plans to early-adopt the guidance, using the modified retrospective approach, to coincide with its adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
100378_18_ITEM15_P69_S2	At June 30, 2018, the Company would have recognized a right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability of $6,527 as a result of the new guidance.
100378_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance (ASU 2015 - 11 ) intended to simplify the measurement of inventory and to closely align with International Financial Reporting Standards.
100378_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	Current guidance requires inventories to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
100378_18_ITEM15_P70_S2	Under this new guidance, inventories other than those measured under last in first out ( LIFO ) are to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
100378_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
100378_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company adopted this guidance, prospectively, in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU 2014 - 09 ) on revenue from contracts with customers.
100378_18_ITEM15_P72_S1	This revenue recognition guidance supersedes existing guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
100378_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control over promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
100378_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	The guidance identifies steps to apply in achieving this principle.
100378_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 ( the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2019 ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	During the fiscal year, the Company concluded its assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its accounting practices.
100378_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	It determined that deferral of revenue is appropriate for certain agreements where the performance of services after product delivery is required.
100378_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	Such services primarily pertain to technical commissioning services by its distribution entities in its marine business, whereby the Company s technicians calibrate the controls and transmission to ensure proper performance for the customer s specific application.
100378_18_ITEM15_P74_S3	This service helps identify issues with the ship s design or performance that need to be remediated by the ship builder or other component suppliers prior to the ship being officially accepted into service by the ship buyer.
100378_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	The cumulative effect adjustment of adopting the new standard is not significant to the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
100378_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	The guidance permits two methods of adoption: full retrospective in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or the modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard will be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company plans to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective approach and will apply the cumulative effect to its retained earnings balance as of July 1, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	The major classes of inventories at June 30 were as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 48% and 36% of total inventories at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $24,630 and $26,422 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $8,427 and $9,068 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Property, plant and equipment at June 30 were as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $6,315, $6,849 and $8,682, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually as of the end of the fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
100378_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	The fair value of reporting units is primarily driven by projected growth rates and operating results under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model, which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate, and consideration of other market approach data from guideline public companies.
100378_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	If declining actual operating results or future operating results become indicative that the fair value of the Company s reporting units has declined below their carrying values, an interim goodwill impairment test may need to be performed and may result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
100378_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	If the Company s market capitalization falls below the Company s carrying value for a sustained period of time or if such a decline becomes indicative that the fair value of the Company s reporting units has declined to below their carrying values, an interim goodwill impairment test may need to be performed and may result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.
100378_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company determined that there were no triggering events to warrant an interim goodwill impairment test.
100378_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018, its measurement date, using current assumptions, including updated forecasted cash flows and a reporting unit specific discount rate of 14.0%, and concluded that goodwill is not impaired.
100378_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	As of June 30, 2018, the balance of goodwill of $2,692 is carried in the European Industrial reporting unit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P83_S3	The fair value of the European Industrial reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 87% and therefore no impairment charge was required for this reporting unit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	Prior to the current fiscal year, the Company recorded significant impairment charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016, primarily due to sustained unfavorable operating results during those years.
100378_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	In fiscal 2016, the impairment charge of $7,602 pertained to a 100% impairment of the Company s European Propulsion reporting unit, and a partial impairment of its U.S. Industrial reporting unit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P84_S2	In fiscal 2017, due to the lack of market recovery in that market, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge to fully impair the balance of $2,550 relating to its U.S. Industrial reporting unit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P84_S3	The impairment charges were recorded after a determination that the fair value of those respective reporting units, as determined using respective discounted cash flow analysis and market participant discount rates, were less than their carrying values.
100378_18_ITEM15_P84_S4	The impairment charges were of a non-cash nature; they did not impact liquidity, result in any future cash expenditures, affect the ongoing or financial performance of the Company, impact compliance with its lending arrangements, or reduce borrowing capacity.
100378_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are summarized as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	At June 30, the following acquired intangible assets have definite useful lives and are subject to amortization:
100378_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	Other intangibles consist of certain amortizable acquisition costs, proprietary technology, computer software and certain customer relationships.
100378_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets included in the table above is approximately 13 years.
100378_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	Intangible amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $149, $168 and $165, respectively.

100378_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	The gross carrying amount of the Company s intangible assets that have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 are $202 and $205, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	These assets are comprised of acquired tradenames.
100378_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	Accrued liabilities at June 30 were as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company warrants all assembled products, parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) and service against defective materials or workmanship.
100378_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
100378_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers.
100378_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation.
100378_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	The warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
100378_18_ITEM15_P94_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends.
100378_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	While we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires.
100378_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following is a listing of the activity in the warranty reserve during the years ended June 30:
100378_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	The current portion of the warranty accrual ( $3,952 and $1,708 for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively) is reflected in accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion ( $455 and $354 for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively) is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
100378_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. ( BMO ) that provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans between the Company and Bank of Montreal and subsequent amendments (the 2016 Credit Agreement ), into a term loan (the Term Loan ) and revolving credit loans (each a Revolving Loan and, collectively, the Revolving Loans, and, together with the Term Loan, the Loans ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount not to exceed $35,000 and the Company may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate, $50,000 (the Revolving Credit Commitment ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Revolving Loans.
100378_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Credit Agreement provides that the Company may elect that the Term Loan and each Revolving Loan to be either LIBOR Loans or Eurodollar Loans.
100378_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	LIBOR Loans will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of a specified margin (the Applicable Margin, determined by the Company s total funded debt to EBITDA ratio) plus the Monthly Reset LIBOR Rate from time to time in effect.
100378_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	Eurodollar Loans will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR applicable for such interest period.
100378_18_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Adjusted LIBOR will be calculated as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	In calculating the Eurodollar Rate, the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage is equal to the maximum reserve percentage at which reserves are imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on eurocurrency liabilities, as defined in such Board s Regulation D.
100378_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	In addition to the monthly interest payments and any mandatory principal payments required by the Credit Agreement (if applicable), the Company will be responsible for paying a quarterly Revolving Credit Commitment Fee and quarterly Letter of Credit Fees.
100378_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Revolving Credit Commitment Fee will be paid at an annual rate equal to the Applicable Margin on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment.
100378_18_ITEM15_P101_S2	The Letter of Credit Fee shall be paid at the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Loans on the daily average face amount of Letters of Credit outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter.

100378_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	Upon the occurrence of an event of default, BMO may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: ( 1 ) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; ( 2 ) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and ( 3 ) demand the Company to immediately cash collateralize letter of credit obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate letter of credit obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary.
100378_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	If such event of default is due to the Company s bankruptcy, BMO may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company.

100378_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	(c) Annuity contracts represent contractual agreements in which payments are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or lump sum amount at a later date.
100378_18_ITEM15_P178_S1	Annuity contracts are valued at the net present value of future cash flows.

100378_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	The components of the net deferred tax asset as of June 30 are summarized in the table below.
100378_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
100378_18_ITEM15_P189_S1	Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.
100378_18_ITEM15_P189_S2	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
100378_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	During fiscal 2018, the Company reported operating income in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited.
100378_18_ITEM15_P190_S1	The Company has evaluated the likelihood of whether the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions would be realized and concluded that, based on recent operational changes implemented, (a) it is more likely than not that all of deferred tax assets would be realized; and that (b) a full valuation allowance on the balance of deferred tax assets relating to these jurisdictions is no longer necessary.
100378_18_ITEM15_P190_S2	The company recorded a net decrease in the valuation allowance of ( $3,803 ) in fiscal 2018 due to higher income and continued utilization of operating losses in these jurisdictions.
100378_18_ITEM15_P190_S3	Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize all the deferred tax assets.
100378_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	Following is a reconciliation of the applicable U.S. federal income taxes to the actual income taxes reflected in the statements of operations:
100378_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P192_S1	The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
100378_18_ITEM15_P192_S2	The Tax Act is generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, which is the Company s fiscal year 2019.
100378_18_ITEM15_P192_S3	However, several provisions of the Tax Act have differing effective dates, meaning these provisions have an impact upon the Company s financial statements for fiscal year 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P192_S4	The provisions impacting the Company s fiscal year 2018 financial statements include the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the imposition of a one -time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, changes to the deductibility of certain meals and entertainment expenses and employee fringe benefits, and the extension of accelerated depreciation on qualified property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 to address uncertainty regarding the application of ASC 740 to the income tax effects of the Tax Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P193_S1	The bulletin provides a measurement period ( not to exceed one year from the Tax Act enactment date) for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
100378_18_ITEM15_P193_S2	To the extent that a company s accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements.
100378_18_ITEM15_P193_S3	If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.
100378_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Tax Act results in comprehensive changes to tax reporting rules.
100378_18_ITEM15_P194_S1	The Company has thoroughly reviewed all provisions of the Tax Act to determine their applicability to both fiscal 2018 and future years.
100378_18_ITEM15_P194_S2	The Company has completed its analysis of all applicable provisions of the Tax Act and has appropriately reflected their impact in the financial statements as per current guidance.
100378_18_ITEM15_P194_S3	The accounting for those provisions of the Tax Act which the Company is currently subject to is disclosed below:
100378_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	Reduction in the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate: The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	A blended rate is calculated for non-calendar year filers resulting in a 27.56% federal tax rate for fiscal year 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P195_S2	The change in tax rate required a revaluation of the end of year deferred assets and liabilities of the Company.
100378_18_ITEM15_P195_S3	This resulted in additional tax expense of $3,786.
100378_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	The deemed repatriation transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries.
100378_18_ITEM15_P196_S1	To determine the amount of the transition tax, the Company calculated the amount of post- 1986 earnings and profits for all foreign subsidiaries as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P196_S2	The Company calculated the amount of the transition tax and determined it to be zero based on overall net historical negative earnings and profits.
100378_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	Deductible Meals Entertainment Expenses: The Tax Act significantly revised the rules related to the deductibility of Meals Entertainment expenses as well as certain employee fringe benefits.
100378_18_ITEM15_P197_S1	Entertainment expenses incurred after December 31, 2017 are 100% disallowed, with one small exception.
100378_18_ITEM15_P197_S2	There will also be much greater scrutiny placed on expenses for Meals to ensure they were incurred for a valid business purpose.
100378_18_ITEM15_P197_S3	The Company has completed a thorough analysis of every expense account in which Meals Entertainment costs may have been recorded and has treated them accordingly based on the new rules under the Tax Act.
100378_18_ITEM15_P197_S4	As anticipated at the end of fiscal year 2018, the financial statement impact of this provision of the Tax Act is immaterial.
100378_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for qualified assets placed in service after September 27, 2017.
100378_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Company has identified the assets which qualify for this provision and has incorporated the additional depreciation expense into the tax provision for fiscal year 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company has not provided additional U.S. income taxes on cumulative earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S1	The Company reaffirms its position that these earnings remain permanently invested, and has no plans to repatriate funds to the U.S. for the foreseeable future.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S2	These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $4,077 at June 30, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S3	Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S4	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on such earnings.
100378_18_ITEM15_P199_S5	The Company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
100378_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	Annually, the company files income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States.
100378_18_ITEM15_P200_S1	In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2014 through 2018 for our major operations in Italy, Belgium and Japan.
100378_18_ITEM15_P200_S2	The tax years open to examination in the U.S. are for years subsequent to fiscal 2015.
100378_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	The Company has approximately $816 of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2018, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate.
100378_18_ITEM15_P201_S1	During the fiscal year the amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased primarily due to reserves which were released upon the conclusion of the fiscal year 2015 IRS income tax audit.
100378_18_ITEM15_P201_S2	During the next twelve months, the Company anticipates closure of the Wisconsin income tax audit for the periods fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2013.
100378_18_ITEM15_P201_S3	This could result in a significant change to the unrecognized tax benefits.
100378_18_ITEM15_P201_S4	The Company s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
100378_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	Below is a reconciliation of beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:
100378_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	Substantially all of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 3018, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
100378_18_ITEM15_P203_S1	As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $93 and $94, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
100378_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable.
100378_18_ITEM15_P204_S1	Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, either individually or in the aggregate.
100378_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company has implemented various restructuring programs in response to unfavorable macroeconomic trends in certain of the Company s markets since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
100378_18_ITEM15_P205_S1	These programs primarily involved the reduction of workforce in several of the Company s manufacturing locations, under a combination of voluntary and involuntary programs.
100378_18_ITEM15_P206_S0	During the current year, the Company implemented additional actions to reduce personnel costs in its Belgian operations and reorganize for productivity in its European operations.
100378_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	These actions, together with the costs associated with the India manufacturing operations exit, resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of $3,398, $1,791 and $921 in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
100378_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	Restructuring activities since June 2015 have resulted in the elimination of 171 full-time employees in the manufacturing segment.
100378_18_ITEM15_P207_S1	Accumulated costs to date under these programs within the manufacturing segment through June 30, 2018 were $9,273.
100378_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	The following is a roll-forward of restructuring activity:
100378_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	During fiscal 2016, as part of its initiative to focus resources on core manufacturing and product development activities aimed at improving profitability, the Company sold one of its distribution entities in the U.S.
100378_18_ITEM15_P209_S1	The proceeds of $4,100 represent the sale of distribution rights to its southeastern U.S. territories, amounting to $600, and certain assets, consisting primarily of inventories, for $3,500.
100378_18_ITEM15_P209_S2	The gain on sale of $445 is recorded as other operating income in the statement of operations in fiscal 2016.
100378_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	The Company calculates basic earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, while the calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period.
100378_18_ITEM15_P210_S1	The calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes all potential common shares if their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect.
100378_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	Restricted stock award recipients have a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends declared by the Company, and are therefore included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two -class method.
100378_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:
100378_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	The following potential common shares were excluded from diluted EPS for the year ended June 30, 2018 because they were anti-dilutive: 61.3 related to the Company s unvested PSAs, 237.7 related to the Company s unvested RS awards, and 3.6 related to outstanding stock options.
100378_18_ITEM15_P214_S0	The following potential common shares were excluded from diluted EPS for the year ended June 30, 2017 because they were anti-dilutive: 170.1 related to the Company s unvested PSAs, 269.6 related to the Company s unvested RS awards, and 13.2 related to outstanding stock options.
100378_18_ITEM15_P215_S0	The following potential common shares were excluded from diluted EPS for the year ended June 30, 2016 because they were anti-dilutive: 72.2 related to the Company s unvested PSAs, 143.0 related to the Company s unvested RS awards, and 16.8 related to outstanding stock options.
100378_18_ITEM15_P216_S0	On July 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Veth Propulsion Holding, B.V. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( Veth Propulsion ).
100378_18_ITEM15_P217_S0	Veth Propulsion is a global manufacturer of highly-engineered auxiliary propulsions and propulsion machinery for maritime vessels, including rudder propellers, bow thrusters, generator sets and engine service and repair supplier of main and auxiliary marine propulsion products, based in the Netherlands.
100378_18_ITEM15_P217_S1	These products are complementary to and expand the Company s current product offerings in the marine and propulsion markets.
100378_18_ITEM15_P217_S2	Prior to the acquisition, the Company was a distributor of Veth products in North America and Asia.
100378_18_ITEM15_P217_S3	This acquisition was pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) entered into by the Company with Veth Propulsion on June 13, 2018.
100378_18_ITEM15_P218_S0	Under the terms of the SPA, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $60,729 in cash at closing, which included a base payment plus adjustments for net cash and working capital.
100378_18_ITEM15_P218_S1	This amount is subject to a final determination of working capital adjustments, which is expected to settle in September 2018, and an earn-out.
100378_18_ITEM15_P218_S2	The maximum earn-out is approximately $4 million.
100378_18_ITEM15_P218_S3	The earn-out will be paid if the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of Veth Propulsion s fiscal 2018 as defined in the PSA ( EBITDA ) exceeds the agreed upon threshold amount.
100378_18_ITEM15_P218_S4	The earn-out may be paid in the form of Company common stock or cash, and will be determined in April 2019.
100378_18_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company financed the payment of the cash consideration through borrowings of $60,729 under a new credit facility, as described in Note G. One-time transaction costs related to the acquisition in the amount of $1,768 were recorded in fiscal 2018 and are included in marketing, engineering, and administration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

100378_18_ITEM15_P220_S1	The preparation of the legacy financial information of Veth Propulsion, heretofore a foreign-owned private company that has not reported under US GAAP, is in progress.
100378_18_ITEM15_P220_S2	Supplemental pro forma financial information, as required, will be available when the Company files its Form 8 -K/A relating to the acquisition before its required filing deadline of September 18, 2018.
