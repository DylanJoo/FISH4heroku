1434110_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a Delaware company primarily engaged in the on-demand e-commerce line of business.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We enable turnkey e-commerce web sites for education, military and media partners under the registered trademark PropellShops in which we sell apparel and other merchandise branded with the organization s logo or other artwork, providing all necessary technology, on-demand manufacturing, marketing and fulfillment services at no risk or cost to its partners, and share resulting revenue with the partners.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our primary target markets are K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses, for whom the company provides a wide selection of options for customized apparel, uniforms, and other merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	Most products are created on demand, meaning they are manufactured as ordered, so there is no finished inventory required.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	While we work with some independent groups and individuals, our business model is based upon the formation of strategic partnerships with key targeted companies involved in each of our target markets in order to obtain access to a large number of customers.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The PropellShops system permits partners with little or no technical or graphic expertise to quickly become Store Owners and have online shops displaying a wide variety of personalized apparel and other merchandise featuring the school or organization s brand or other artwork.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Store Owner then publicizes the shop to its potential customers, and Propell does all manufacturing, billing, customer support and shipping.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Since Propell does not charge for the set up fee for e-commerce shops, and merchandise is only manufactured when ordered, the PropellShops system eliminates almost all risk or investment for Store Owners.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	They carry no inventory, and Propell handles all fulfillment.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	Further, Propell s on-demand system also eliminates minimum order quantities and long lead times.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Propell collects all revenue and then distributes a share of every sale to the Store Owner.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our principal offices are located at 305 San Anselmo Avenue, Suite 300, San Anselmo, CA 94960.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our telephone number is (415) 747-8775.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Propell Corporation is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, which was formed solely for the purpose of the merger of CMI with and into Propell.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	As part of this transaction, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	A total of 2,094,864 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 136,088 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to the members of AUL.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The mergers were completed in order to form a consolidated enterprise with subsidiaries that each have experience in complementary parts of the imaging and personalized products industries, and to expand their capabilities both online and at retail.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	In mid-2009, Management decided to concentrate its efforts and assets on its e-commerce and laser etching businesses.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Shortly thereafter, AUL and AMS began to wind down operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	In January 2010, AUL was dissolved.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	In late 2009, AMS assigned its warranty responsibilities and its inventory to a third party and ceased operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P9_S4	We dissolved AMS in late 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In early 2010, management decided to concentrate on its e-commerce business.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	This led to closing CMI s operations in June 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We were created to acquire and aggregate customers and leverage significant growth trends and opportunities in the promotional products and digital photo industries.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	As we have evolved as a company, and in response to market conditions, we now focus on offering personalized merchandise via custom web sites, primarily K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our particular focus on the school market is driven by the size of the market and our belief that this category is underserved by current providers of our type of on-demand merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	There are over 130,000 K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics most recent report, as well as more than 6,000 post-secondary schools.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	While most schools already offer school gear purchased in quantity, we believe each of these institutions is a candidate for our type of on-demand merchandise service, since unlike traditional apparel and merchandise printing methods, it requires no upfront investment in inventory, and can be personalized with no minimum quantities.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our management team has extensive experience in technology, customer acquisition, ecommerce and retail with particular focus in the online, kiosk and photo merchandise category, as well as the promotional products market.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We believe this experience is highly applicable to our target markets for personalized merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We present here various statistics and other industry information that are generally available to the public or to members of industry trade associations.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	With respect to the Photo Marketing Association ( PMA ), we paid to be a member of that association at the time we received this information, and received that association s statistics as all members do.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	We did not fund nor were we otherwise affiliated with any of the studies that are the basis for these statistics and other industry information.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	While no industry statistics are available on the size of the relatively recent market for on-demand merchandise for schools and our other target categories, the custom products/gifts category defined by the Photo Marketing Association) as personalized calendars, photo books, posters, t-shirts, mugs mouse pads, photo CDs and DVDs ordered at retail or at online stores grew from $250 million in 2004 to an estimated $1.3 billion in 2009, according to the PMA research division, including photo cards, photo books, and other personalized merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe these trends are applicable to our target markets.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	More recently, industry research company Infotrends forecast, in its U.S. Consumer Photo Merchandise Forecast for 2009 2014 , that the category will reach $2.2 billion by 2014.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The online marketplace for image-based products actually spans several categories, primarily those of photo sharing web sites and image merchandise sites.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our management team has relevant experience in both.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Photo sharing web sites, such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery and Snapfish, are designed for consumers and are optimized for sharing and printing photos, and creating photo merchandise from those images.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Social networks, including Flickr, Myspace, and Facebook, have extensive photo capabilities integrated into their functionality.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Image merchandise sites, such as Zazzle, Cafepress and Threadless, allow artists, consumers and small businesses to create their own custom web stores featuring selected images that can be reproduced on a broad variety of merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our operations most closely resemble this category, although we focus on different target customers.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	By offering personalized merchandise, we also compete in the promotional products category, also known as the advertising specialty category.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Promotional products, which include any products used to promote a product, service or company program, including textiles and other personalized products, constituted a $15.6 billion category in 2009, according to the most recent research available from the Promotional Products Association International (PPAI), an industry trade association.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We see significant opportunity given that approximately half of distributors in the promotional products category are small businesses (defined as those under $2.5 million), and less than 16% of industry revenues are generated from online sales methods, according to the most recent data available from PPAI.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that our PropellShops e-commerce and on-demand manufacturing capabilities, infrastructure and marketing, along with a strategy of focusing on markets currently underserved by other providers, will permit us to grow in each of our target markets.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	We also believe the low or zero cost of setting up a PropellShop will continue to attract new accounts, especially those such as schools and nonprofits, that may have limited funds and staff resources to invest in and manage such purchases.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our PropellShops service permits artists, consumers and businesses to quickly create an online store for merchandise featuring their images, with our company or its manufacturing partners performing all fulfillment, manufacturing, shipping and billing.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	This system provides a special web site at which a customer -- whether a business, group, or individual -- can design and set up a web store featuring their own logos, photos or other artwork.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	That web store can then be linked to, or embedded into, the customer s own web site.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	We then operate that store for the customer, taking orders, manufacturing and shipping product and paying a share of the revenue to the customer.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Additionally, our management has experience in retail fulfillment.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	One of our founders previously created PhotoTLC, a photo merchandise company serving major retail customers including Walgreens, Wal-Mart, CVS, Rite Aid and Meijer stores.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	With PropellShops, we offer a turnkey e-commerce web site permitting our partners to offer personalized or custom merchandise featuring their logo or other artwork.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	PropellShops permits a partner whether a school, nonprofit, rock band or business to create a complete web store, potentially with 100s of items of personalized merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	The partner sets the prices, and we create and host the store, arrange for the products to be manufactured on demand and shipped from one or more of our contract facilities, collect the revenues, and send the partner a check for the profits.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	We currently have stores with hundreds of K-12 schools, as well as universities, nonprofits, musicians and businesses, as well as offering military products through the Army Air Force Exchange.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In addition to the e-commerce and fulfillment services described above, we also provide design and marketing support for most partners, including assistance with setting up appropriate shops, and marketing materials for their use in reaching their target audience, including brochures, flyers and emails.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our PropellShops operation, including its transmission of digital images over the Internet, is subject to regulation by the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission and various states, local, and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	In general, these regulations govern privacy, the manner in which orders may be solicited, the form and content of advertisements, information which must be provided to prospective customers, the time within which orders must be filled, obligations to customers if orders are not shipped within a specified period of time, and the time within which refunds must be paid if the ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Congress has enacted legislation to specifically regulate online commerce and communications and has addressed such issues as the transmission of certain materials to children, intellectual property protection, and taxation.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Other legislation could result in additional regulation or prohibition of the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	This regulation could limit the type of business we pursue or increase the costs to ensure compliance.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We deliver our products and services through a diverse set of online partners, including K-12 schools, universities, newspapers, musical groups, military through the Army Air Force Exchange Service and small and large businesses.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	We believe having several sales channels will maximize sales potential while minimizing the risk that any underperforming channel will jeopardize the overall business.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Competition in online photo and merchandise space takes several forms.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Photo sharing web sites are designed for consumers and are optimized for sharing and printing photos, and creating photo merchandise from those images.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	Competitors include Kodak Gallery, Shutterfly, Snapfish, Photobucket, Webshots, and social networking sites such Facebook, as well as the web sites of photo retailers such as Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	More closely, we compete with image merchandise sites that allow artists, consumers and small businesses to create their own custom web stores featuring selected images.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Competitors include Zazzle, Cafepress and Threadless, as well as school merchandise e-commerce sites such as Prep Sportswear.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	In the school market, there is also fragmented completion from local screen printers and similar suppliers with brick and mortar shops and long-standing relationships with schools.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	After analyzing existing online players in the photo merchandise category, we believe we identified a significant underserved opportunity to partner with key business partners to provide an on demand service that most closely competes with the image merchandise companies such as Zazzle and Cafepress, but has what we believe are advantages in selecting underserved markets, as well as product quality, pricing, ease of setup and turnaround times.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	In particular, Zazzle and Cafepress focus on the artist and small-group market, while we believe a large, underserved market exists in partnering with a broader range of customers, particularly schools, nonprofits, military media companies, as well as corporate and special interest partners.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	In the product area, we compete in each category by carrying a mix of products that are tailored to a given market.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	For instance, in the school market, we poll our customers and use other forms of market research to identify product trends that particularly appeal to students, segmented by age group, and seek to innovate with offerings not available from our competitors.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	In working with the military market, we carry products specific to the demographic, branch of service, location, and even individual military unit again seeking to offer products or designs unavailable from competitors.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Similarly, we customize our service offerings in particular our web design, as well as the marketing campaigns and email blasts we provide to our store owner partners so that they match the needs of the market we are focusing on.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	For instance, when working with political organizations, we customize the web service to fulfill regulatory requirements related to political fund raising.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	When working with the military, we integrate payment methods unique to our military partner.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	When working with schools, we provide marketing emails, posters and other materials that target the particular needs of that audience.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	While we do not compete primarily on price, we attempt to be very competitive in revenue sharing with our partners, and try to offer higher margins to our store owner partners than competitors.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also permit our store owners more flexibility in setting the retail pricing than competing companies do.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	For instance, we permit a fund raising organization to set as high a price as they like on any given item, while competitors set certain limits.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Thus, we are set up so that if a store owner wishes, for fundraising purposes, to set the price of a simple T-shirt at $100 on the basis of it being both a collectible item, and a fundraising contribution, he or she can do so.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S4	We then collect the larger amount on their behalf, and pay the store owner the difference between the amount collected and our posted wholesale price.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P35_S5	Our competition often limits the top price that can be charged.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our PropellShops web services were created using our own technology, as well as proprietary enhancements to open source software tools.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	We have created a variety of artwork and other materials used in communicating, promoting and marketing our products and services.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	We have been issued registered trademarks for Propell , PropellShops as well as our logo artwork.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have insurance for general commercial liability with the Zurich Group in an amount of $2 million.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We have worker s compensation insurance with The Hartford in an amount equal to 100% of our payroll for the current year.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have products and completed operations insurance in the aggregate amount of $2 million.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Company has its headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, and regional sales and operations employees and sales representatives in Ohio, Connecticut and Florida.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have independent sales agents in California and Arizona.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The San Francisco area office is primarily focused on all corporate matter and PropellShops, including software development, sales, marketing strategic partnerships and business development.
1434110_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We use third party manufacturers to make, customize and ship our products.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	You may read and copy any document we file at the SEC s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	You may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the public reference room.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information that issuers (including Propell) file electronically with the SEC.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The SEC s website is www.sec.gov .
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are currently updating our website to provide a link to the SEC s website at www.sec.gov that will provide, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; current reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports and forms.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We will make these filings available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We will voluntarily provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, in evaluating us and our business you should carefully consider the risks set forth below, which are only a few of the risks associated with investing in our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	You should be in a position to risk the loss of your entire investment.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Because we are entering into new business lines that are unproven, it is difficult to predict if we will generate material revenues or be profitable.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Until recently, our business has been substantially dependent upon our ability to generate revenue from our subsurface etched photo crystal products.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We only recently began focusing the majority of our efforts on our e-commerce web sites.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Because our new business model is unproven, we may not generate material revenues from such businesses.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	It is too early to predict whether consumers will accept, and continue to use on a regular basis, the products generated from these new business lines since we have had very limited recent operating history in our new business lines nor significant revenues or earnings derived from such business lines.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Therefore, our ability to generate revenue is uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate significant revenue or be profitable.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently engaging in a new line of business and have very limited operating history and limited information.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company is currently expanding its operations and engaging in a new business line.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with our current management and structure.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our management has limited direct experience in our new lines of business.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	For the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had net revenues of $100,352 and $10,717, respectively from our continuing e-commerce business.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, we sustained a net loss of $1,670,449 and $1,781,945, respectively.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our future revenues and profitability depends in large part on our ability and to retain our current relationships with our customers, including eChalk and the Army Air Force Exchange and individual schools, universities, nonprofits and businesses, and attract new customers for our e-commerce websites.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our relationships with these customers depend on our satisfactorily performing our contracted services.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we do not successfully retain our current customers, or market successfully against competitors, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may not be able to continue as a going concern.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our consolidated audited financial statements, report a 2010 loss from continuing operations of $(1,576,136) and a net loss of $(1,670,449).
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The opinion of our independent registered accounting firm on our audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2010 for Propell was qualified subject to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and the notes to our Financial Statements.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our future plans and operations are dependent on our raising additional capital.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We have recently raised debt financing under a credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $2,000,000, of which $1,067,500 principal amount is outstanding as of the date hereof and we have borrowed an additional $300,000 from a shareholder under three separate short-term notes.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In fact, we have used money raised in prior financings to pay some of our costs.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Other than the credit facility, we have used all of the $2.6 million we raised over the last twenty-four months in the form of convertible notes and a rights offering.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We do not believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to allow us to implement our anticipated plan of operations or meet our future anticipated cash flow requirements.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely on key vendors and suppliers.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to sustain satisfactory levels of sales is dependent in part upon the ability of our suppliers and vendors to properly perform their function.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have no significant long-term purchase contracts or agreements to ensure continued supply, pricing or access to raw materials and equipment used in our business.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	While we believe that alternate sources of third-party providers are available, it is possible that our vendors might not be able to continue to meet our requirements for services or supplies, or purchase services or supplies in sufficient quantities or on terms as favorable to us as those currently available.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The failure of our suppliers to supply our raw materials on a timely basis or at satisfactory prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Also, changing to an alternate vendor or supplier may cause delays, reduced quality or other problems.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of competitors.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The market for e-commerce products is highly competitive and still emerging.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We face competition in personalized products from other direct marketers, online companies, and competitors in other distribution channels, including much larger companies.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Many of our competitors offer similar products and services.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our services by offering innovative services and products and exemplary customer service.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although we believe we are a leader in developing and marketing innovative personalized services and products, competitors can and do provide similar services and products.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	There can be no assurance we will continue to compete effectively through development of innovative services and products or the provision of exemplary customer service and experience or that we will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We experience fluctuations in quarterly results.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate for many reasons, including:
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a result of the above conditions, our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate the results that can be expected for any future period.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our operating results in a future period may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have no independent audit committee.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our full board of directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of two directors, one of whom is not considered independent.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	This may hinder our board of directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of two directors, one of whom are not considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the board of directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our board of directors, which consists of two directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our board of directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Governmental regulation could limit our business opportunities and increase costs.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our operations, including our transmission of digital images over the Internet, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission and various states, local, and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In general, these regulations govern privacy, the manner in which orders may be solicited, the form and content of advertisements, information which must be provided to prospective customers, the time within which orders must be filled, obligations to customers if orders are not shipped within a specified period of time, and the time within which refunds must be paid if the ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Congress has enacted legislation to specifically regulate online commerce and communications and has addressed such issues as the transmission of certain materials to children, intellectual property protection, and taxation.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, however, should such statutes and regulations be amended or interpreted more stringently, we may be unable to remain in compliance and may incur penalties and fines for noncompliance.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Other legislation could result in additional regulation or prohibition of the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If such legislation were deemed to apply to our business, it could limit the type of business that we could pursue or increase the costs to ensure compliance.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the our operations or business prospects.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Some of our existing stockholders can exert control over us and may not make decisions that are in the best interests of all stockholders.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As of March 30, 2011, officers, directors, and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding shares collectively controlled approximately 50.45% of our outstanding common stock, without taking into account shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible securities.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, would be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our shares by delaying or preventing a change in control of us, even if a change is in the best interests of our other stockholders.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Under certain circumstances we a claim could be made that we will be responsible for the payment of certain of Crystal Magic s debts.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	There is a risk that we could be a party to certain litigation involving payments owed by our Crystal Magic, Inc. subsidiary to the US Small Business Loans (the SBA ) and the Orlando National Bank ( Bank ) in the amount of approximately $839,000.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Crystal Magic ceased operations in June 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In September 2010, the Bank foreclosed on the assets of Crystal Magic and sold these assets at auction; however the sale proceeds were not adequate to satisfy the outstanding remaining debt.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In an agreement with Steven and Vicki Rhodes, guarantors of the Crystal Magic SBA debt, we agreed to assume the payment for these loans in the event of the bankruptcy of Crystal Magic and the demand of the SBA or the Orlando National Bank of payment under Mr. Rhodes guarantee.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	To date, Crystal Magic has not filed for bankruptcy and so the condition for our obligation has not been met, and even if met we believe that such agreement is unenforceable.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Mr. Rhodes has placed 2,000,000 shares of our stock, owned by him, in escrow to be used by us in our discretion at any time after April 8, 2010, to pay the amounts owed by Crystal Magic under these loans.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the shares held in escrow will have sufficient value to satisfy such debt.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If Mr. Rhodes were to try to enforce the provisions of the agreement we would vigorously defend our position; however no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our defense.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our Common Stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our Common Stock should have a long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There may be future dilution of our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have incurred operating losses in the past and may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we are unable to produce our products and provide our services at commercially reasonable costs, if revenues decline or if our expenses exceed our expectations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Also, we are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment, (FASB ASC Topic 718-10).
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P47_S6	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Interruptions to our information technology systems, personalized-product production processes or customer service operations could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems, personalized-product production processes and customer service operations are critical to our reputation, and our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain adequate customer satisfaction.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Any interruptions that result in reduced order fulfillment performance or customer service could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand and cause our business and results of operations to suffer.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business interruption insurance policies do not address all potential causes of business interruptions that we may experience, and any proceeds we may receive from these policies in the event of a business interruption may not fully compensate us for the revenues we may lose.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our under-capitalization has resulted in our not being able to build our business and infrastructure as quickly as we would like.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our limited capital has placed, and will continue to place, a strain on our and their administrative and operational infrastructure.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to refine our operational, financial and management controls, human resource policies and reporting systems.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If we are unable to manage future expansion, we may not be able to implement improvements to our controls, policies and systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our ability to provide high-quality products, service and customer support could be compromised, which would damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our and their business and results of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Competitive pricing pressures may harm our business and results of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Demand for our products and services is sensitive to price.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Many external factors, including our production and personnel costs and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly impact our pricing strategies.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we fail to meet our customers price expectations, we or they could lose customers, which would harm our and their business and results of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical, marketing and production personnel, some of whom have formed critical relationships with the companies with whom we have contracts.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The loss of these key employees, several of whom is at will and may terminate his or her employment relationship with us at any time, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We and they face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, marketing, financial services, manufacturing and e-commerce companies.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to implement our business plan.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTC-Bulletin Board.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P61_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In the event of such an issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over the then current market price per share.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S5	No preferred stock is currently outstanding and we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock.
1434110_11_ITEM1A_P66_S6	However, the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of the common stock and deprive shareholders of the right to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.
1434110_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently lease offices in Northern California.
1434110_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our office is in San Anselmo and consists of approximately 1,050 square feet.
1434110_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our landlord, also a shareholder of the Company, currently provides the space rent free.
1434110_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe if we lost our lease at these premises, we could promptly relocate within 30 days.
1434110_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no material legal proceedings that are pending or have been threatened against us of which management is aware.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin board since April 23, 2010 under the symbol PROP.BB.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that date, there was no active market for our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for our common stock for the periods indicated.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin board on March 29, 2011, was $0.19 per share.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of March 30, 2011, there were approximately 80 holders of record of our common stock.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we have no intention of paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	Whether we declare and pay dividends is determined by our board of directors at their discretion, subject to certain limitations imposed under Delaware corporate law.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	The timing, amount and form of dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	In March 2008, we issued $22,780 in convertible promissory notes to 43 note holders.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	These promissory notes converted by their terms into 2,278,000 shares of our common stock upon the merger acquisitions of Mountain Capital, LLC and Auleron 2005, LLC with wholly owned subsidiaries of the Registrant.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The offering and sale of the promissory notes and the shares of common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance by us did not involve a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) because the offer and sale was made to an insubstantial number of persons and because of the manner of the offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to, and received, share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S3	This restriction ensured that these shares will not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore be part of a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S4	This offering was done with no general solicitation or advertising by us.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P4_S5	Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	In May 2008, we issued $1,730,000 in 3% non-recourse convertible promissory notes to 18 note holders.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	These promissory notes automatically converted into shares of the Registrant s common stock at a rate of one share of common stock for each $.50 of principal, at the close of our a PIPE (private investment in public equity) financing in March 2009, or at a 25% discount to the PIPE price, whichever is less.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	The offering and sale of the promissory notes qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance by us did not involve a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S3	The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) because the offer and sale was made to an insubstantial number of persons and because of the manner of the offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S4	In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to, and received, promissory notes bearing a legend stating that such notes are restricted.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S5	This restriction ensured that these promissory notes will not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore be part of a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S6	This offering was done with no general solicitation or advertising by us.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P5_S7	Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	On April 10, 2008, we issued 5,400,000 shares of our common stock to five individuals in exchange for securities upon the mergers of Crystal Magic, Inc., Mountain Capital, LLC and Auleron 20005, LLC with us.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	This offering and sale of shares of the Registrant s common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance by the Registrant did not involve a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) because the offer and sale was made to an insubstantial number of persons and because of the manner of the offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S3	In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to, and received, share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S4	This restriction ensured that these shares will not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore be part of a public offering.
1434110_11_ITEM5_P6_S5	This offering was done with no general solicitation or advertising by us.

1434110_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual results may vary from those estimates.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their short-term nature.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The carrying amount for borrowings under the financing agreement approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rates charged for these borrowings.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	We adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , for financial assets and financial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which did not have an impact on our financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	No. 157 , we deferred application of SFAS No.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	157 until January 1, 2010, the beginning of our next fiscal year, in relation to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities including goodwill impairment testing, asset retirement obligations, long-lived asset impairments and exit and disposal activities.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	We place our cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the FDIC insurance limit.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	We extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, generally without collateral.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	We monitor our exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses, as required.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1(O), Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our current operations involve sales and operations from PropellShops.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The operations of Auleron 2005, LLC were dissolved in January 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	We determined the net fair market value of the assets and liabilities of Auleron 2005, LLC at December 31, 2009, LLC to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The operations of Crystal Magic were closed in June 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In September 2010, Orlando National bank foreclosed on the assets of Crystal Magic and sold them at auction.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our PropellShops system offers organizations a turnkey e-commerce web site permitting our partners to offer personalized or custom merchandise featuring their logo or other artwork.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	PropellShops permits a partner whether a school, nonprofit, rock band or business to create a complete web store, potentially with 100s of items of personalized merchandise.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	The partner sets the prices, and we create and host the store, arrange for the products to be manufactured on demand and shipped from one or more of our contract facilities, collect the revenues, and send the partner a check for the profits.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	We currently have stores with hundreds of K-12 schools, as well as universities, nonprofits, musicians and businesses, as well as offering military products through the Army Air Force Exchange.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	In addition to the e-commerce and fulfillment services described above, we also provide design and marketing support for most partners, including assistance with setting up appropriate shops, and marketing materials for their use in reaching their target audience, including brochures, flyers and emails.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We believe the PropellShops service opens up substantial new opportunities and channels by providing web sites with the opportunity to easily integrate a personalized merchandise online store with their own site with little effort or cost.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Strategic outsource partners perform the fulfillment, manufacturing and shipping of these product(s).
1434110_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The PropellShops product is a key part of our strategy for 2011 and beyond.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our ability to continue to execute on our plan of operations is contingent on our ability to raise additional capital to expand our Internet initiatives and marketing.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not have sufficient capital to last the next 12 months; however it is our intent to raise significant additional capital through the sale of securities.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Company will seek approximately $2 to $3 million in new equity and or debt.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	We will try to accomplish this through discussions with previous investors as well as seeking an investment bank to assist in raising funds.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Results of Operations 2010 Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations, excluding discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	It also details the changes from the prior fiscal year in absolute dollars and in percentages.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	We have reported the results of operations of businesses we discontinued in 2009 and 2010 as discontinued operations for both the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	PropellShops revenue increased over $89,000 or 836% as we began minimal sales and marketing during the year.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	During 2009, we were primarily developing and testing the web site.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Gross profit increased from a loss of 1,951 or 118% of revenue in 2009 to a profit of $28,475 or 28% of revenue.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The loss in 2009 was the result of operations just beginning during the year and the Company absorbing one-time costs.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We believe that gross margins will improve as volume increases.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operating expenses increased from 2009 to 2010 by $546,706 or 52%.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Operating expenses includes a write-off of $303,357 for the website asset previously capitalized by the Company.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	At December 31, 2010 management determined that the website asset was fully impaired as:
1434110_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	During the year, the company had numerous acquisition discussions.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	In each case, no deal was formalized due to the Company s lack of working capital.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	in October 2010, final negotiations with a, previously disclosed potential merger candidate ceased specifically due to the delay in fund raising on our part.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	at December 31, 2010 discussions regarding a significant new source for equity were not progressing satisfactorily.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	While the Company continues to receive short-term debt financing from a shareholder, without a significant influx in working capital, significant revenue growth cannot be assured.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Excluding the write-off of the website asset, operating expenses increased $243,349 or 23%.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	This increase was the result of significant increases in marketing expenses for trade shows, customized shops and marketing materials.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	At the end of the fiscal year we had no operating subsidiaries.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Crystal Magic (CMI), which operated our laser etching business, ceased operations in June 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	CMI generated revenues of $165,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, down from $1,009,000 in 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	Revenues have been included in discontinued operations.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	Revenues in 2010 came principally from the sale of customized laser etched products at the Disney World Theme Park.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	Until September 2009, we also sold laser etched products to corporate clients for gifting.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	In 2010, CMI generated gross profit of $129,000 or 78% of revenue during the year down from 878,000, or 87% or revenue in 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decrease in gross profit from 2009 to 2010 as a percentage of revenue, was caused by commission paid to Disney on all sales in 2010, vs. approximately 30% of sales in 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Operating expenses in 2010 of $217,000 consisted primarily of salaries and consulting fees ($162,000 or 80% of total operating costs) to maintain personnel in the theme park and management of the operations.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	In 2009, we closed our Mountain Capital LLC(MC) business.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	MC generated revenues of $72,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $480,000 in losses.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $4,559,651 through December 31, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs in the next 12 months.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	During 2010, the Company borrowed $660,000 under a convertible note.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had borrowed a total of $1,067,500 (excluding accrued interest) under this convertible note.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	On July 22, 2010, the convertible note holder notified the Company that it would exercise its right to convert to equity at the closing of the next round of financing.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	In February 2011, the due date on the convertible note was extended to August 31, 20111, and the total amount available to be borrowed was increased to $2,000,000.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S4	Availability and drawdowns are subject to lender approval in his sole discretion.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P41_S5	The material terms of this Agreement are:
1434110_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Note may be converted into common stock of the Company at the lower of $0.27 per share or a 25% discount to the first round of financing following the date of the credit facility (September 3, 2009).
1434110_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The lender has the right to rescind the conversion to equity in the case where the amount of new equity raised is less than $1.5 million.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	There are no financial or other materials covenants in this Agreement.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	In June 2010, the Company borrowed $100,000 under a one year unsecured note from a shareholder.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Interest accrues on the note at the rate of 8% per annum.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	The note has no financial covenants.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	In December 2010, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000 under similar terms with a due date of December 15, 2011 and interest accruing at 10%.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	In February 2011, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P45_S5	This note is due February 10, 2012, accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum and has no financial covenants.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company s Crystal Magic (CMI) subsidiary owes approximately $839,000 to the U.S. Small Business Loans (the SBA ) and the Orlando National Bank (together, Lenders ).
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	In June 2010, CMI ceased operations.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Lenders foreclosed and seized all Company assets and held an auction and liquidated such assets.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Lenders have acknowledged they have no rights directly against Propell and have told us they plan to seek repayment from Mr. Steven Rhodes, a former owner of CMI and who had personally guaranteed the loans.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	Previously, we had entered into an agreement with Steve Rhodes, whereby we agreed to assume the payment for these loans in the event of the bankruptcy of Crystal Magic and the demand of the SBA or the Orlando National Bank of payment under Mr. Rhodes guarantee.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S5	Mr. Rhodes placed 2,000,000 shares of our stock, owned by him, in escrow to be used by us in our discretion at any time after April 8, 2010, to pay the amounts owed by Crystal Magic under these loans.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S6	To date, Crystal Magic has not filed for bankruptcy and so the condition for our obligation has not been met, and even if met we believe that such agreement is unenforceable.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S7	However, there can be no assurance that the shares held in escrow will have sufficient value to satisfy such debt or that Mr. Rhodes won t seek reimbursement from the Company, to the extent he makes any payments to the Lenders.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P46_S8	If Mr. Rhodes were to try to enforce the provisions of the agreement we would vigorously defend our position; however no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our defense.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	We do not have any firmly committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S7	If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P47_S8	As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Propell s primary sources and uses of cash for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, included losses from operations, adjusted for non-cash items of income and expense and funds received from a rights offering and from a convertible note.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Net cash used in operating activities was $115,851 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, was $1,220,902 primarily attributable to the capital expenditures of $474,797 for the acquisition of the Propell.com domain and development of the Propell shops web site and $741,703 related to CMI.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,295,578, which included $407,500 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes 888,078 from a rights offering.
1434110_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	There have been no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure with our independent auditors for the period ended December 31, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P0_S4	The Company s CEO has concluded, that as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and that all material weaknesses and significant deficiencies have been completely remediated due to the retention of an additional bookkeeper and a consultant who are integrally involved in the preparation of the financial statements and all disclosure.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, thought not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 because as a part of our year end review of our disclosure controls and procedures, we determined that several of our procedures require additional documentation.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P7_S2	It is our belief that those control procedures are being performed, however documentation of their execution is not available.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that as of the date of this Annual Report, all material weaknesses and significant deficiencies have been completely remediated due to the retention of an additional bookkeeper and a consultant who are integrally involved in the preparation of the financial statements and all disclosure.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	This Annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1434110_11_ITEM15_P3_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Propell Corporation, a Delaware Corporation, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P3_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1434110_11_ITEM15_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P4_S2	The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P4_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P4_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Propell Corporation, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its consolidated operations and cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Propell Corporation will continue as a going concern.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	As discussed in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations, has negative working capital, and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P7_S2	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P7_S3	Management s plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 13.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P7_S4	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1434110_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	(A) Description of the Business Propell Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Propell or the Company ) is an e-commerce and fulfillment provider of image-based personalized products and services.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	(B) Principles of Consolidation All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the amount allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, the estimated useful lives for amortizable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	(D) Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S2	In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S3	Revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S4	Receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S5	Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P17_S6	There were no recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	(E) Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	(F) Risks and Uncertainties The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	These conditions not only limit our access to capital, but also make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company minimizes credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the balance did not exceed the federally insured limit.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	(H) Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	Items of property and equipment with costs greater than $1,000 are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	(I) Inventory Inventory is stated at cost using the FIFO (first in, first out) method.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	During the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company wrote down inventory at its CMI subsidiary that it deemed unsellable in the amounts of $51,342 and $226,028, respectively, which are reflected in the restated Statement of Operations in loss from discontinued operations.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	(J) Fixed and intangible Assets Fixed and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	The Company took impairment charges on fixed assets of $6,372 and $85,527 during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P26_S3	These charges are reflected in the restated statement of operations in loss from discontinued operations.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P26_S4	The Company took an impairment charge of $303,357 for its website asset in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	(K) Net Loss per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including the effect of share equivalents.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	The Company s share equivalents consist of 1,974,000 stock options and 4,600,434 warrants.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P27_S3	Since the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 respectively, all common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive; as such there is no separate computation for diluted earnings per share.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	The carrying amounts of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued interest related parties, notes payable related parties and convertible notes payable related party approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	(M) Share-Based Payment Arrangements Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	The expense resulting from share-based payments are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	(N) Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	It is the Company s policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P31_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which amends previous guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as annual financial statements in the current economic environment.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	This pronouncement was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, these provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to the fair value of our financial instruments.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events , which establishes general standards of accounting for, and disclosures of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	This pronouncement was effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial position; however, the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 855 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to subsequent events.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance now codified as FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , as the single source of authoritative non-governmental U.S. GAAP.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	FASB ASC Topic 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	All existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification will be considered non-authoritative.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S3	These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, were effective for the current fiscal reporting period.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S4	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, but will impact our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P34_S5	On the effective date of FASB ASC Topic 105, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, and all other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S3	In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S4	For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S5	This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S6	This update will become effective for the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S7	We will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P35_S8	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this update will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (ASU 2010-28).
1434110_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test so that for those reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not based on an assessment of qualitative indicators that a goodwill impairment exists.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	In determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	As a result of the exit from Crystal Magic s laser etching business in June 2010 and Mountain Capital LLC in 2009, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the CMI and Mountain Capital business operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company has restated its balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of stockholders deficit, and statement of cash flows for 2009 to correct an error in its accounting.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company did not originally amortize its website asset in 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	The website asset and accumulated deficit were corrected at December 31, 2009.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	(1) After taking into account the reclassifications discussed in Footnote 2, above.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	On December 31, 2009, the Company wrote off assets of Mountain Capital and Crystal Magic having a net book value of $85,527 due to impairment.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	This change is reflected in the restated statement of operations in loss from discontinued operations.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Depreciation expense was $2,371 and $4,357 for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 prepaid expenses consisted solely of prepaid insurance in the amount of $5,053 and $4,587, respectively.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	In 2009, the Company substantially completed development on its primary website and capitalized the expenses incurred from programming in the amount of $501,202.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	In 2009, the Company began amortizing these costs over five years.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	At December 31, 2010 management determined that the website asset was fully impaired and wrote off the remaining balance of $303,357.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P44_S3	The rationale for the impairment was:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	During the year, the company had numerous acquisition discussions.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	In each case, no deal was formalized due to the Company s lack of working capital.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	In October 2010, final negotiations with a previously disclosed potential merger candidate ceased specifically due to the delay in fund raising on our part.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	Such merger would have brought a significant new customer base and driven new customers to the website; and 3.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	At December 31, 2010 discussions regarding a significant new source for equity were not progressing satisfactorily.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	While the Company continues to receive short-term debt financing from a shareholder, without a significant influx in working capital, significant revenue growth cannot be assured.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 accrued expenses consisted of the following:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has borrowed $1,067,500 under the terms of a convertible note payable.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	This note is convertible to shares of the Company s common stock at the lenders option at the lower of $0.27 per share or a twenty-five percent (25%) discount from the next issuance of common stock by the Company.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Note was originally due on February 28, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S3	In March 2010, the Note was amended to change the due date to June 30, 2010 and the maximum amount of the Note was increased to $1 Million.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S4	In July, 2010, the Note holder notified the Company of his intention to convert the Note, upon the Company completing a financing of at least $1.5 million.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S5	In February, 2011, the Note was amended to increase the maximum amount to $2 million and to change the due date to August 31, 2011.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P48_S6	In addition, the Note was amended to allow the Company the option to convert the Note once it has raised $500,000 in new equity.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	In June 2010, the Company borrowed $100,000 under a one year unsecured note from a shareholder.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	Interest accrues on the note at the rate of 8% per annum.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The note has no financial covenants.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	In December 2010, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000 under similar terms, except that the interest rate on this note is 10% per annum, with a due date of December 15, 2011.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S4	On February 10, 2011, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000 which is due February 10, 2012.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P49_S5	This loan accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum and has no financial covenants.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company s Crystal Magic subsidiary has four (4) notes all of which are either guaranteed or funded by the United States Small Business Administration (SBA).
1434110_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	At December 31, 2010, the notes total an aggregate of approximately $838,542.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Crystal Magic is in default on all of these notes.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	In September 2010, the bank managing the loans for the SBA seized substantially all of the assets of CMI and subsequently sold these assets.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 other income (expense) consisted of the following:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	(A) Common Stock Issuances of Issuer For the Year ended December 31, 2010 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued 275,000 shares of common stock for services rendered, having a fair value of $44,000.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	For the Year ended December 31, 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued 856,667 shares of common stock for services rendered, having a fair value of $286,650.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	Of this, 741,667 shares were issued in connection with severance agreements.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued 8,650,000 shares of common stock in connection with the conversion of convertible notes in the principal amount of $1,730,000 ($0.20 per share).
1434110_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued 3,066,956 shares of common stock in two rights offerings for proceeds of $828,078 ($0.27 per share).
1434110_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	In 2008 the Company s Board of Directors approved the Company s 2008 Stock Option Plan (the Stock Plan ) for the issuance of up to five (5) million shares of common stock to be granted through incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to officers, other employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	The exercise price of stock options under the Stock Plan is determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, and may be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the option is granted.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	Options become exercisable over various periods from the date of grant, and generally expire ten years after the grant date.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P57_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there were 1,974,000 options issued and outstanding under the Stock Plan.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	In the event of termination, the Company will cease to recognize compensation expense.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	There is no deferred compensation recorded upon initial grant date, instead, the fair value of the share-based payment is recognized ratably over the stated vesting period.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company has applied fair value accounting for all share based payment awards since inception.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	The fair value of each option or warrant granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Black-Scholes assumptions used in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company records stock based compensation based upon the stated vested provisions in the related agreements, with recognition of expense recorded on the straight line basis over the term of the related agreement.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	The vesting provisions for these agreements have various terms as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	During 2010, the Company granted 675,000 options to employees and consultants having a fair value of $80,265 based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	During 2009, the Company granted 749,000 options to employees and consultants having a fair value of $43,440 based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	The options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2010 are as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2009 are as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s non-vested stock options at December 31, 2010:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company rents office space from a related party on a month-to-month basis for $1,649 per month.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	Beginning January 1, 2011, the related party agreed to waive the monthly rent payment.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	There is no obligation for this arrangement to continue.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	There was no income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to the Company s net losses.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company s tax expense differs from the expected tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, (computed by applying the Federal Corporate tax rate of 34% to loss before taxes), as follows:
1434110_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $1,564,000 available to offset future taxable income expiring through 2030.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	Utilization of these net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	The valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 was approximately $535,866.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	Based on consideration of these items, Management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2010.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company has negative working capital, has incurred operating losses since inception, and its operating activities to date have required financing from outside institutions and related parties.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	The Company will continue to need outside financing to support its internal growth.

1434110_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	In February 2011, the Company renegotiated its convertible notes to extend the maturity date to August 31, 2011 and to increase the total potential loan amount to $2 million.
1434110_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	In addition, in February, 2011, the Company borrowed an additional $100,000 from a shareholder who had previously loaned the Company $200,000.

1434110_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a Delaware company primarily engaged in the on-demand e-commerce line of business.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We enable turnkey e-commerce web sites for education, military and media partners under the registered trademark PropellShops in which we sell apparel and other merchandise branded with the organization s logo or other artwork, providing all necessary technology, on-demand manufacturing, marketing and fulfillment services at no risk or cost to its partners, and share resulting revenue with the partners.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our primary target markets are K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses, for whom the company provides a wide selection of options for customized apparel, uniforms, and other merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Most products are created on demand, meaning they are manufactured as ordered, so there is no finished inventory required.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	While we work with some independent groups and individuals, our business model is based upon the formation of strategic partnerships with key targeted companies involved in each of our target markets in order to obtain access to a large number of customers.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The PropellShops system permits partners with little or no technical or graphic expertise to quickly become Store Owners and have online shops displaying a wide variety of personalized apparel and other merchandise featuring the school or organization s brand or other artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Store Owner then publicizes the shop to its potential customers, and Propell does all manufacturing, billing, customer support and shipping.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Since Propell does not charge a set-up fee for e-commerce shops, and merchandise is only manufactured when ordered, the PropellShops system eliminates almost all risk or investment for Store Owners.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	They carry no inventory, and Propell handles all fulfillment.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	Further, Propell s on-demand system also eliminates minimum order quantities and long lead times.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Propell collects all revenue and then distributes a share of every sale to the Store Owner.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our principal offices are located at 305 San Anselmo Avenue, Suite 300, San Anselmo, CA 94960.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our telephone number is (415) 747-8775.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Propell Corporation is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, which was formed solely for the purpose of the merger of CMI with and into Propell.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	As part of this transaction, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	A total of 2,094,864 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 136,088 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to the members of AUL.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The mergers were completed in order to form a consolidated enterprise with subsidiaries that each have experience in complementary parts of the imaging and personalized products industries, and to expand their capabilities both online and at retail.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	In mid-2009, Management decided to concentrate its efforts and assets on its e-commerce and laser etching businesses.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Shortly thereafter, AUL and AMS began to wind down operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	In January 2010, AUL was dissolved.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	In late 2009, AMS assigned its warranty responsibilities and its inventory to a third party and ceased operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	We dissolved AMS in late 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	In early 2010, management decided to concentrate on its e-commerce business.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	This led to closing CMI s operations in June 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	In December 2011, the Company laid off most of its employees and substantially reduced the working hours of the remaining employees.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	It also ceased virtually all marketing and out bound sales activities.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company continues to fulfill new orders.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Company is actively seeking additional financing and is also exploring selling all or part of its business.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We were created to acquire and aggregate customers and leverage significant growth trends and opportunities in the promotional products and digital photo industries.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	As we have evolved as a company, and in response to market conditions, we now focus on offering personalized merchandise via custom web sites, primarily K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our particular focus on the school market is driven by the size of the market and our belief that this category is underserved by current providers of our type of on-demand merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	There are over 130,000 K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics most recent report, as well as more than 6,000 post-secondary schools.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	While most schools already offer school gear purchased in quantity, we believe each of these institutions is a candidate for our type of on-demand merchandise service, since unlike traditional apparel and merchandise printing methods, it requires no upfront investment in inventory, and can be personalized with no minimum quantities.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our management team has extensive experience in technology, customer acquisition, ecommerce and retail with particular focus in the online, kiosk and photo merchandise category, as well as the promotional products market.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe this experience is highly applicable to our target markets for personalized merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We present here various statistics and other industry information that are generally available to the public or to members of industry trade associations.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	With respect to the Photo Marketing Association ( PMA ), we paid to be a member of that association at the time we received this information, and received that association s statistics as all members do.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	We did not fund nor were we otherwise affiliated with any of the studies that are the basis for these statistics and other industry information.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	While no industry statistics are available on the size of the relatively recent market for on-demand merchandise for schools and our other target categories, the custom products/gifts category defined by the Photo Marketing Association) as personalized calendars, photo books, posters, t-shirts, mugs mouse pads, photo CDs and DVDs ordered at retail or at online stores grew from $250 million in 2004 to an estimated $1.3 billion in 2009, according to the PMA research division, including photo cards, photo books, and other personalized merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We believe these trends are applicable to our target markets.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	More recently, industry research company Infotrends forecast, in its U.S. Consumer Photo Merchandise Forecast for 2009 2014 , that the category will reach $2.2 billion by 2014.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The online marketplace for image-based products actually spans several categories, primarily those of photo sharing web sites and image merchandise sites.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our management team has relevant experience in both.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Photo sharing web sites, such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery and Snapfish, are designed for consumers and are optimized for sharing and printing photos, and creating photo merchandise from those images.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Social networks, including Flickr, Myspace, and Facebook, have extensive photo capabilities integrated into their functionality.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Image merchandise sites, such as Zazzle, Cafepress and Threadless, allow artists, consumers and small businesses to create their own custom web stores featuring selected images that can be reproduced on a broad variety of merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Our operations most closely resemble this category, although we focus on different target customers.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	By offering personalized merchandise, we also compete in the promotional products category, also known as the advertising specialty category.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Promotional products, which include any products used to promote a product, service or company program, including textiles and other personalized products, constituted a $16.5 billion category in 2010, according to the most recent research available from the Promotional Products Association International (PPAI), an industry trade association.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	We see significant opportunity given that approximately half of distributors in the promotional products category are small businesses (defined as those under $2.5 million), and less than 17% of industry revenues are generated from online sales methods, according to the most recent data available from PPAI.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe that our PropellShops e-commerce and on-demand manufacturing capabilities, infrastructure and marketing, along with a strategy of focusing on markets currently underserved by other providers, will permit us to grow in each of our target markets.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	We also believe the low or zero cost of setting up a PropellShop will continue to attract new accounts, especially those such as schools and nonprofits, that may have limited funds and staff resources to invest in and manage such purchases.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our PropellShops service permits artists, consumers and businesses to quickly create an online store for merchandise featuring their images, with our company or its manufacturing partners performing all fulfillment, manufacturing, shipping and billing.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	This system provides a special web site at which a customer whether a business, group, or individual can design and set up a web store featuring their own logos, photos or other artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	That web store can then be linked to, or embedded into, the customer s own web site.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	We then operate that store for the customer, taking orders, manufacturing and shipping product and paying a share of the revenue to the customer.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Additionally, our management has experience in retail fulfillment.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	One of our founders previously created PhotoTLC, a photo merchandise company serving major retail customers including Walgreens, Wal-Mart, CVS, Rite Aid and Meijer stores.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	With PropellShops, we offer a turnkey e-commerce web site permitting our partners to offer personalized or custom merchandise featuring their logo or other artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	PropellShops permits a partner whether a school, nonprofit, rock band or business to create a complete web store, potentially with 100s of items of personalized merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	The partner sets the prices, and we create and host the store, arrange for the products to be manufactured on demand and shipped from one or more of our contract facilities, collect the revenues, and send the partner a check for the profits.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	We currently have stores with hundreds of K-12 schools, as well as universities, nonprofits, musicians and businesses, as well as offering military products through the Navy Exchange Command (Nexcom) and independent shops.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	In addition to the e-commerce and fulfillment services described above, we also provide design and marketing support for most partners, including assistance with setting up appropriate shops, and marketing materials for their use in reaching their target audience, including brochures, flyers and emails.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our PropellShops operation, including its transmission of digital images over the Internet, is subject to regulation by the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission and various states, local, and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	In general, these regulations govern privacy, the manner in which orders may be solicited, the form and content of advertisements, information which must be provided to prospective customers, the time within which orders must be filled, obligations to customers if orders are not shipped within a specified period of time, and the time within which refunds must be paid if the ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Congress has enacted legislation to specifically regulate online commerce and communications and has addressed such issues as the transmission of certain materials to children, intellectual property protection, and taxation.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Other legislation could result in additional regulation or prohibition of the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	This regulation could limit the type of business we pursue or increase the costs to ensure compliance.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We deliver our products and services through a diverse set of online partners, including K-12 schools, universities, newspapers, musical groups, military through the Navy Exchange Command and small and large businesses.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe having several sales channels will maximize sales potential while minimizing the risk that any underperforming channel will jeopardize the overall business.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Competition in online photo and merchandise space takes several forms.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Photo sharing web sites are designed for consumers and are optimized for sharing and printing photos, and creating photo merchandise from those images.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Competitors include Kodak Gallery, Shutterfly, Snapfish, Photobucket, Webshots, and social networking sites such Facebook, as well as the web sites of photo retailers such as Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	More closely, we compete with image merchandise sites that allow artists, consumers and small businesses to create their own custom web stores featuring selected images.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Competitors include Zazzle, Cafepress and Threadless, as well as school merchandise e-commerce sites such as Prep Sportswear.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	In the school market, there is also fragmented completion from local screen printers and similar suppliers with brick and mortar shops and long-standing relationships with schools.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	After analyzing existing online players in the photo merchandise category, we believe we identified a significant underserved opportunity to partner with key business partners to provide an on demand service that most closely competes with the image merchandise companies such as Zazzle and Cafepress, but has what we believe are advantages in selecting underserved markets, as well as product quality, pricing, ease of setup and turnaround times.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	In particular, Zazzle and Cafepress focus on the artist and small-group market, while we believe a large, underserved market exists in partnering with a broader range of customers, particularly schools, nonprofits, military media companies, as well as corporate and special interest partners.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	In the product area, we compete in each category by carrying a mix of products that are tailored to a given market.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	For instance, in the school market, we poll our customers and use other forms of market research to identify product trends that particularly appeal to students, segmented by age group, and seek to innovate with offerings not available from our competitors.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	In working with the military market, we carry products specific to the demographic, branch of service, location, and even individual military unit again seeking to offer products or designs unavailable from competitors.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Similarly, we customize our service offerings in particular our web design, as well as the marketing campaigns and email blasts we provide to our store owner partners so that they match the needs of the market we are focusing on.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	For instance, when working with political organizations, we customize the web service to fulfill regulatory requirements related to political fund raising.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	When working with the military, we integrate payment methods unique to our military partner.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	When working with schools, we provide marketing emails, posters and other materials that target the particular needs of that audience.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	While we do not compete primarily on price, we attempt to be very competitive in revenue sharing with our partners, and try to offer higher margins to our store owner partners than competitors.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We also permit our store owners more flexibility in setting the retail pricing than competing companies do.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	For instance, we permit a fund raising organization to set as high a price as they like on any given item, while competitors set certain limits.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	Thus, we are set up so that if a store owner wishes, for fundraising purposes, to set the price of a simple T-shirt at $100 on the basis of it being both a collectible item, and a fundraising contribution, he or she can do so.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	We then collect the larger amount on their behalf, and pay the store owner the difference between the amount collected and our posted wholesale price.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	Our competition often limits the top price that can be charged.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our PropellShops web services were created using our own technology, as well as proprietary enhancements to open source software tools.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have created a variety of artwork and other materials used in communicating, promoting and marketing our products and services.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	We have been issued registered trademarks for Propell , PropellShops as well as our logo artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	We have insurance for general commercial liability with the Zurich Group in an amount of $2 million.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	We have worker s compensation insurance with The Hartford in an amount equal to 100% of our payroll for the current year.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have products and completed operations insurance in the aggregate amount of $2 million.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Company has its headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, and an operations contractor in Connecticut.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The San Francisco area office is primarily focused on all corporate matters and PropellShops, including overseeing of software development, sales, marketing strategic partnerships and business development.
1434110_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	We use third party manufacturers to make, customize and ship our products.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	You may read and copy any document we file at the SEC s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	You may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the public reference room.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information that issuers (including Propell) file electronically with the SEC.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The SEC s website is www.sec.gov .
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	It provides a link to the SEC s website at www.sec.gov that provides, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; current reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports and forms.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We will voluntarily provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, in evaluating us and our business you should carefully consider the risks set forth below, which are only a few of the risks associated with investing in our common stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	You should be in a position to risk the loss of your entire investment.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Because we are entering into new business lines that are unproven, it is difficult to predict if we will generate material revenues or be profitable.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Until recently, our business has been substantially dependent upon our ability to generate revenue from our subsurface etched photo crystal products.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We only recently began focusing the majority of our efforts on our e-commerce web sites.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Because our new business model is unproven, we may not generate material revenues from such businesses.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	It is too early to predict whether consumers will accept, and continue to use on a regular basis, the products generated from these new business lines since we have had very limited recent operating history in our new business lines nor significant revenues or earnings derived from such business lines.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Therefore, our ability to generate revenue is uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate significant revenue or be profitable.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently engaging in a new line of business and have very limited operating history and limited information.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company is currently expanding its operations and engaging in a new business line.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with our current management and structure.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our management has limited direct experience in our new lines of business.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may not be able to continue as a going concern.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our consolidated audited financial statements, report a 2011 loss from continuing operations of $(1,374,047) and a net loss of $(1,374,047).
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The opinion of our independent registered accounting firm on our audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2011 for Propell was qualified subject to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and the notes to our Financial Statements.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In December 2011, the Company laid off most of its employees and substantially reduced the working hours of the remaining employees.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	It also ceased virtually all marketing and outbound sales activities.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The Company continues to fulfill new orders.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had net revenues of $204,796 and $100,352, respectively from our continuing e-commerce business.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010, we sustained a net loss of $1,374,047 and $1,670,449, respectively.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to continue to fulfill orders if we do not receive additional financing.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Due to limited capital and related staff reductions, we have reduced our outbound sales and marketing activities until such time that more working capital can be secured or is generated from sales growth.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We continue to accept and ship orders placed on our ecommerce web sites from existing customers, and from new customers who use our online tools to set up their own shops.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	However, our lack of cash makes it difficult for us to purchase necessary products or retain employees.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are currently in default under two of our notes.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Two of our notes issued to a related party one in the principal amount of $100,000 and the other in the remaining principal amount of $50,000 were due February 10, 2012 and December 15, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Should the holder of any note demand payment and we are unable to renegotiate the terms of the note, the note holder could declare the note in default and take legal action against us.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our ability to continue to operate is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funds to repay the notes secured by our assets or to renegotiate the terms of the notes.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We have several notes that are due in 2012 and 2013, and we will need additional capital to repay these loans and may not be able to obtain it .
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As of April 1, 2012, we have notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,848,413 outstanding.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Of such amount, notes in the principal amount of $150,000 are past due, and the balance of the notes are due in 2012.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We do not have the funds to repay these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We will need to raise additional funds in order to repay these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available if needed on terms favorable to us.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Certain of our notes contain features that could have a dilutive effect to our investors.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If the price of our common stock drops, one of our lenders will be entitled to reduce the price at which it converts its notes to shares of our common stock and therefore will be entitled to receive more shares than anticipated.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	On October 23, 2011, we issued to Tripod Group, LLC ( Tripod ) convertible redeemable promissory notes in the principal amounts of (1) $150,000 (the 150,000 Note ) and (ii) $50,000 (the 50,000 Note , and together with the $150,000 Note, the Notes ).
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The principal amount of the Notes is convertible at any time after April 23, 2012, at the option of Tripod, at a conversion price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Notes, equal to 65% of the lowest closing bid price of the Company s common stock on the five (5) trading days preceding the notice of conversion (including the day upon which a notice of conversion is received by the Company).
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The conversion price may also be adjusted downward if, within three (3) business days of receipt of a notice of conversion, the Company s common stock has a closing bid price which is five percent (5%) or lower than the price set forth in the notice of conversion.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any reduction in the conversion price as set forth above will result in us issuing a greater number of shares of common stock than anticipated, which will have the effect of diluting the shares of common stock of our investors.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition in August, September and December 2011 and March 2012, we borrowed $53,000, $32,500, $32,500 and $32,500 from one lender, which notes are convertible into our common stock at a price equal to 65% of lowest closing bid price of the Company s common stock on the five (5) trading days preceding the conversion.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our future revenues and profitability depends in large part on our ability and to retain our current relationships with our customers, including eChalk and the Army Air Force Exchange and individual schools, universities, nonprofits and businesses, and attract new customers for our e-commerce websites.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our relationships with these customers depend on our satisfactorily performing our contracted services.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we do not successfully retain our current customers, or market successfully against competitors, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our future plans and operations are dependent on our raising additional capital.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011 we received $308,000 in proceeds from the sale of our convertible notes and $362,188 from the sale of notes and advances from a related party.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we raised $863,000 from financing activities.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We have used money raised in prior financings to pay some of our costs.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We do not believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to allow us to implement our anticipated plan of operations or meet our future anticipated cash flow requirements.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have laid off all employees (effective 12/15/11) except for Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Wallace.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Mr. Bernstein has agreed to temporarily defer salary (although the compensation owed under his contract is being accrued), while Mr. Wallace and our lead software engineer are working on an as-needed basis with hourly compensation.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical, marketing and production personnel and contractors, some of whom have formed critical relationships with the companies with whom we have contracts.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The loss of these key employees or contractors, several of whom who are at will and may terminate employment relationship with us at any time, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our current financial position makes it more difficult for us to retain employees due to the limited amount we have available for compensation.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We and they face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, marketing, financial services, manufacturing and e-commerce companies.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to implement our business plan.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We rely on key vendors and suppliers.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our ability to sustain satisfactory levels of sales is dependent in part upon the ability of our suppliers and vendors to properly perform their function.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We have no significant long-term purchase contracts or agreements to ensure continued supply, pricing or access to raw materials and equipment used in our business.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	While we believe that alternate sources of third-party providers are available, it is possible that our vendors might not be able to continue to meet our requirements for services or supplies, or purchase services or supplies in sufficient quantities or on terms as favorable to us as those currently available.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The failure of our suppliers to supply our raw materials on a timely basis or at satisfactory prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Also, changing to an alternate vendor or supplier may cause delays, reduced quality or other problems.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of competitors.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The market for e-commerce products is highly competitive and still emerging.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We face competition in personalized products from other direct marketers, online companies, and competitors in other distribution channels, including much larger companies.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Many of our competitors offer similar products and services.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our services by offering innovative services and products and exemplary customer service.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Although we believe we are a leader in developing and marketing innovative personalized services and products, competitors can and do provide similar services and products.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P34_S6	There can be no assurance we will continue to compete effectively through development of innovative services and products or the provision of exemplary customer service and experience or that we will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We experience fluctuations in quarterly results.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate for many reasons, including:
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As a result of the above conditions, our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate the results that can be expected for any future period.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our operating results in a future period may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have no independent audit committee.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our full board of directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of three directors, one of whom is not considered independent.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	This may hinder our board of directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of three directors, one of whom is not considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the board of directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our board of directors, which consists of three directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our board of directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Governmental regulation could limit our business opportunities and increase costs.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our operations, including our transmission of digital images over the Internet, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission and various states, local, and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In general, these regulations govern privacy, the manner in which orders may be solicited, the form and content of advertisements, information which must be provided to prospective customers, the time within which orders must be filled, obligations to customers if orders are not shipped within a specified period of time, and the time within which refunds must be paid if the ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Congress has enacted legislation to specifically regulate online commerce and communications and has addressed such issues as the transmission of certain materials to children, intellectual property protection, and taxation.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, however, should such statutes and regulations be amended or interpreted more stringently, we may be unable to remain in compliance and may incur penalties and fines for noncompliance.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Other legislation could result in additional regulation or prohibition of the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If such legislation were deemed to apply to our business, it could limit the type of business that we could pursue or increase the costs to ensure compliance.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the our operations or business prospects.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Some of our existing stockholders can exert control over us and may not make decisions that are in the best interests of all stockholders.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As of March 30, 2012, officers, directors, and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding shares collectively controlled approximately 31.3% of our outstanding common stock, without taking into account shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible securities.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, would be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our shares by delaying or preventing a change in control of us, even if a change is in the best interests of our other stockholders.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Under certain circumstances a claim could be made that we will be responsible for the payment of certain of Crystal Magic s debts.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There is a risk that we could be a party to certain litigation involving payments owed by our Crystal Magic, Inc. subsidiary to the US Small Business Loans (the SBA ) and the Orlando National Bank ( Bank ) in the amount of approximately $839,000.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Crystal Magic ceased operations in June 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In September 2010, the Bank foreclosed on the assets of Crystal Magic and sold these assets at auction; however the sale proceeds were not adequate to satisfy the outstanding remaining debt.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In an agreement with Steven and Vicki Rhodes, guarantors of the Crystal Magic SBA debt, we agreed to assume the payment for these loans in the event of the bankruptcy of Crystal Magic and the demand of the SBA or the Orlando National Bank of payment under Mr. Rhodes guarantee.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	To date, Crystal Magic has not filed for bankruptcy and so the condition for our obligation has not been met, and even if met we believe that such agreement is unenforceable.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Mr. Rhodes has placed 2,000,000 shares of our stock, owned by him, in escrow to be used by us in our discretion at any time after April 8, 2010, to pay the amounts owed by Crystal Magic under these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the shares held in escrow will have sufficient value to satisfy such debt.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P54_S5	If Mr. Rhodes were to try to enforce the provisions of the agreement we would vigorously defend our position; however no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our defense.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our Common Stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our Common Stock should have a long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	There may be future dilution of our common stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have incurred operating losses in the past and may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we are unable to produce our products and provide our services at commercially reasonable costs, if revenues decline or if our expenses exceed our expectations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Also, we are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment, (FASB ASC Topic 718-10).
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S5	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P61_S6	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Interruptions to our information technology systems, personalized-product production processes or customer service operations could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems, personalized-product production processes and customer service operations are critical to our reputation, and our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain adequate customer satisfaction.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Any interruptions that result in reduced order fulfillment performance or customer service could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand and cause our business and results of operations to suffer.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our business interruption insurance policies do not address all potential causes of business interruptions that we may experience, and any proceeds we may receive from these policies in the event of a business interruption may not fully compensate us for the revenues we may lose.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our under-capitalization has resulted in our not being able to build our business and infrastructure as quickly as we would like.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Our limited capital has placed, and will continue to place, a strain on our and their administrative and operational infrastructure.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to refine our operational, financial and management controls, human resource policies and reporting systems.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If we are unable to manage future expansion, we may not be able to implement improvements to our controls, policies and systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our ability to provide high-quality products, service and customer support could be compromised, which would damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our and their business and results of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Competitive pricing pressures may harm our business and results of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Demand for our products and services is sensitive to price.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Many external factors, including our production and personnel costs and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly impact our pricing strategies.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	If we fail to meet our customers price expectations, we or they could lose customers, which would harm our and their business and results of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTC-Bulletin Board.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P72_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In the event of such an issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S4	Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over the then current market price per share.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S5	No preferred stock is currently outstanding and we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock.
1434110_12_ITEM1A_P77_S6	However, the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of the common stock and deprive shareholders of the right to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.
1434110_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently lease offices in Northern California.

1434110_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	In December 2011, the Company laid off most of its employees and substantially reduced the working hours of the remaining employees.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	It also ceased virtually all marketing and out bound sales activities.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The Company continues to fulfill new orders.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are a Delaware corporation providing e-commerce and fulfillment for image-based personalized products and services via custom websites for schools, nonprofits, media companies and other organizations.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Through our proprietary online system, we allow partners to create instant e-commerce web sites (marketed as PropellShops ).
1434110_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	This system provides a special web site at which a customer whether a business, group, or individual can design and set up a web store featuring their own logos, photos or other artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	That web store can then be embedded into, or linked from, the customer s own web site.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	We then operate that store for the customer, taking orders, manufacturing and shipping product and paying a share of our revenue to the customer.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	All of our current operations are conducted through Propell.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We ceased operations of CMI in 2010 due to poor performance and insufficient capital.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	In 2009 we also ceased doing business through our AMS subsidiary.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	We assigned inventory and our warranty responsibilities and interaction with customers to a third party.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	We dissolved AMS in late 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	Our third subsidiary, Auleron 2005, LLC, discontinued its operations in 2008; in November 2009, the decision was made to liquidate Auleron since it had no operations and management determined its resources were better focused on its Internet business.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	Auleron was formally liquidated in January 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Prior to our formation in January 2008, each subsidiary was independently owned.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our current customers include eChalk, the Los Angeles Times, the Navy Exchange Command, and numerous K-12 schools and universities, through e-commerce web sites.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In addition, our management has a long track record of delivering a variety of consumer and photo products, services and logistics to partners, including Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite-Aid.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our principal offices are located at 305 San Anselmo Avenue, Suite 300, San Anselmo, CA 94960.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our telephone number is (415) 747-8775.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this MD A, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to the individual Notes to the Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or services are delivered to customers, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Net revenues include product sales net of returns and allowances.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Estimates are based on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual results may vary from those estimates.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their short-term nature.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The carrying amount for borrowings under the financing agreement approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rates charged for these borrowings.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We adopted FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair V a lue Measurements Disclosures , for financial assets and financial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which did not have an impact on our financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We place our cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the FDIC insurance limit.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	We extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, generally without collateral.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	We monitor our exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses, as required.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1, Reorganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our current operations involve sales and operations from PropellShops.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The operations of Auleron 2005, LLC were dissolved in January 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	We determined the net fair market value of the assets and liabilities of Auleron 2005, LLC at December 31, 2009, LLC to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	The operations of Crystal Magic were closed in June 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In September 2010, Orlando National bank foreclosed on the assets of Crystal Magic and sold them at auction.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our PropellShops system offers organizations a turnkey e-commerce web site permitting our partners to offer personalized or custom merchandise featuring their logo or other artwork.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	PropellShops permits a partner whether a school, nonprofit, rock band or business to create a complete web store, potentially with 100s of items of personalized merchandise.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The partner sets the prices, and we create and host the store, arrange for the products to be manufactured on demand and shipped from one or more of our contract facilities, collect the revenues, and send the partner a check for the profits.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	We currently have stores with hundreds of K-12 schools, as well as universities, nonprofits, musicians and businesses, as well as offering military products through the Navy Exchange Command.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	In addition to the e-commerce and fulfillment services described above, we also provide design and marketing support for most partners, including assistance with setting up appropriate shops, and marketing materials for their use in reaching their target audience, including brochures, flyers and emails.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	We believe the PropellShops service opens up substantial new opportunities and channels by providing web sites with the opportunity to easily integrate a personalized merchandise online store with their own site with little effort or cost.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Strategic outsource partners perform the fulfillment, manufacturing and shipping of these product(s).
1434110_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The PropellShops product is a key part of our strategy for 2011 and beyond.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our ability to continue to execute on our plan of operations is contingent on our ability to raise additional capital to expand our Internet initiatives and marketing.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Due to limited capital and related staff reductions, we have reduced our outbound sales and marketing activities until such time that more working capital can be secured or is generated from sales growth.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	We continue to accept and ship orders placed on our ecommerce web sites from existing customers, and from new customers who use our online tools to set up their own shops.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	However, our lack of cash makes it difficult for us to purchase necessary products and retain employees.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	We do not have sufficient capital to last the next quarter; however it is our intent to raise significant additional capital through the sale of securities.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	The Company continues to seek new equity and/or debt.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	We will try to accomplish this through discussions with previous investors as well as seeking new financial or strategic investors.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations, excluding discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	It also details the changes from the prior fiscal year in absolute dollars and in percentages.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We have reported the results of operations of businesses we discontinued in 2010 [and 2011] as discontinued operations for both the year ended December 31, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	PropellShops revenue increased by $104,444 to $204,796 or 104%; however unless we receive financing we will not be able to continue this upward revenue trend.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross profit increased from $28,475 or 28% of revenue in 2010 to a profit of $65,922 or 32% of revenue.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	We believe that gross margins improved as volume increased.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Operating expenses decreased from 2010 to 2011 by $130,587 or 11%, partially due to our reduction in staff resulting from our financial position.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	At the end of the fiscal year we had no operating subsidiaries.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Crystal Magic (CMI), which operated our laser etching business, ceased operations in June 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	CMI generated revenues of $165,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, down from $1,009,000 in 2009.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Revenues have been included in discontinued operations.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	Revenues in 2010 came principally from the sale of customized laser etched products at the Disney World Theme Park.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P34_S5	Until September 2009, we also sold laser etched products to corporate clients for gifting.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	In 2010, CMI generated gross profit of $129,000 or 78% of revenue during the year.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Operating expenses in 2010 of $217,000 consisted primarily of salaries and consulting fees ($162,000 or 80% of total operating costs) to maintain personnel in the theme park and management of the operations.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $5,933,698 through December 31, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs in the next quarter.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S5	Due to limited capital and related staff reductions, we have reduced our outbound sales and marketing activities until such time that more working capital can be secured or is generated from sales growth.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S6	We continue to accept and ship orders placed on our ecommerce web sites from existing customers, and from new customers who use our online tools to set up their own shops.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P36_S7	However, our lack of cash makes it difficult for us to purchase necessary products and retain employees.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	As of April 1, 2012, we have notes, net of debt discount, in the aggregate principal amount of $1,800,136 outstanding.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Of such amount, notes in the principal amount of $150,000 are past due, and the balance of the notes are due in 2012.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	We do not have the funds to repay these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	We will need to raise additional funds in order to repay these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available if needed on terms favorable to us.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	During 2011, the Company borrowed a total of $308,000 through the issuance of convertible notes.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	These Notes all mature within twelve months, carry interest rates of between six and eight percent per annum and allow the lenders to convert these notes into equity at a 45% discount from the average price they sell the shares.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, the Company borrowed $362,188 from one shareholder through a series on short-term notes and advances.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	These notes carry an interest rate of 10% per annum.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	None of the convertible or non-convertible notes has any financial covenants.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	During 2010, the Company borrowed $660,000 under a convertible note.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had borrowed a total of $1,067,500 (excluding accrued interest) under this convertible note.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	On July 22, 2010, the convertible note holder notified the Company that it would exercise its right to convert to equity at the closing of the next round of financing.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	In February 2011, the due date on the convertible note was extended to August 31, 20111, and the total amount available to be borrowed was increased to $2,000,000.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Availability and draw downs are subject to lender approval in his sole discretion.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	The material terms of this Agreement are:
1434110_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Note may be converted into common stock of the Company at the lower of $0.27 per share or a 25% discount to the first round of financing following the date of the credit facility (September 3, 2009).
1434110_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The lender has the right to rescind the conversion to equity in the case where the amount of new equity raised is less than $1.5 million.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	There are no financial or other material covenants in this Agreement.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In June 2010, the Company borrowed $100,000 under a one year unsecured note from a shareholder.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Interest accrues on the note at the rate of 8% per annum.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	The note has no financial covenants.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	In December 2010, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000 under similar terms with a due date of December 15, 2011 and interest accruing at 10%.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	In February 2011, the shareholder lent us an additional $100,000.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P43_S5	This note is due February 10, 2012, accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum and has no financial covenants.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company s Crystal Magic (CMI) subsidiary owes approximately $839,000 to the U.S. Small Business Loans (the SBA ) and the Orlando National Bank (together, Lenders ).
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	In June 2010, CMI ceased operations.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Lenders foreclosed and seized all Company assets and held an auction and liquidated such assets.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	The Lenders have acknowledged they have no rights directly against Propell and have told us they plan to seek repayment from Mr. Steven Rhodes, a former owner of CMI and who had personally guaranteed the loans.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	Previously, we had entered into an agreement with Steve Rhodes, whereby we agreed to assume the payment for these loans in the event of the bankruptcy of Crystal Magic and the demand of the SBA or the Orlando National Bank of payment under Mr. Rhodes guarantee.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	Mr. Rhodes placed 2,000,000 shares of our stock, owned by him, in escrow to be used by us in our discretion at any time after April 8, 2010, to pay the amounts owed by Crystal Magic under these loans.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	To date, Crystal Magic has not filed for bankruptcy and so the condition for our obligation has not been met, and even if met we believe that such agreement is unenforceable.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S7	However, there can be no assurance that the shares held in escrow will have sufficient value to satisfy such debt or that Mr. Rhodes won t seek reimbursement from the Company, to the extent he makes any payments to the Lenders.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P44_S8	If Mr. Rhodes were to try to enforce the provisions of the agreement we would vigorously defend our position; however no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our defense.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	We do not have any firmly committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S6	If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S7	If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P45_S8	As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.
1434110_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_12_ITEM9_P0_S0	There have been no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure with our independent auditors for the period ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P0_S4	The Company s CEO has concluded, that as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and that all material weaknesses and significant deficiencies have been completely remediated due to the retention of an additional bookkeeper and a consultant who are integrally involved in the preparation of the financial statements and all disclosure.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, thought not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	This Annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P5_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P6_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Propell Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its consolidated operations and cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Propell Corporation will continue as a going concern.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	As discussed in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations, has negative working capital, and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P8_S2	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P8_S3	Management s plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 13.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P8_S4	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	Propell Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Propell or the Company ) is an e-commerce and fulfillment provider of image-based personalized products and services.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P15_S1	Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the amount allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, the estimated useful lives for amortizable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S2	Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S3	In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S4	Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S5	Receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S6	Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S7	There were no recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P17_S8	Bad debt expense was $4,485 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	These conditions not only limit our access to capital, but also make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company minimizes credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P22_S2	At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the balance did not exceed the federally insured limit.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	Items of property and equipment with costs greater than $1,000 are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, as follows:
1434110_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Inventory is stated at cost using the FIFO (first in, first out) method.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	During the year ending 2010, the Company wrote down inventory at its CMI subsidiary that it deemed unsellable in the amounts of $51,342, which is reflected in the restated Statement of Operations in loss from discontinued operations.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Fixed and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company took an impairment charge on fixed assets of $6,372 during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S4	This charge is reflected in the statement of operations in loss from discontinued operations.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P25_S5	The Company took an impairment charge of $303,357 for its website asset in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including the effect of share equivalents.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	The Company s share equivalents consist of 4,844,000 stock options and 4,600,434 warrants.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P26_S3	Since the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, all common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive; as such there is no separate computation for diluted earnings per share.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The carrying amounts of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, due from others, inventory, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued interest, notes payable and advances related parties and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	The expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	It is the Company s policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	As of December 31, 2011, there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S3	In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S4	For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S5	This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S6	This update will become effective for the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S7	We will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P30_S8	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this update will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (ASU 2010-28).
1434110_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test so that for those reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not based on an assessment of qualitative indicators that a goodwill impairment exists.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	In determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements, eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Under either choice, items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be presented on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Previous guidance under Topic 350 required an entity to test goodwill for impairment using a two-step process on at least an annual basis.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	First, the fair value of a reporting unit was calculated and compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Second, if the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, the amount of impairment loss, if any, was required to be measured.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Under the amendments in this update, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads the entity to determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	If the entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to test goodwill for impairment under the two-step process as described under paragraphs 350-20-35-4 and 350-20-35-9 under Topic 350.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P37_S3	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P37_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	As a result of the exit from Crystal Magic s laser etching business in June 2010 and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the CMI business operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Property and Equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1434110_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Depreciation expense was $2,028 and $2,371 for the periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	In 2009, the Company substantially completed development on its primary website and capitalized the expenses incurred from programming in the amount of $501,202.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	In 2009, the Company began amortizing these costs over five years.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	At December 31, 2010 management determined that the website asset was fully impaired and wrote off the remaining balance of $303,357.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	The rationale for the impairment was:
1434110_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	During the year, the Company had numerous acquisition discussions.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	In each case, no deal was formalized due to the Company s lack of working capital.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	In October 2010, final negotiations with a previously disclosed potential merger candidate ceased specifically due to the delay in fund raising on our part.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	At December 31, 2010 discussions regarding a significant new source for equity were not progressing satisfactorily.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	While the Company continued to receive short-term debt financing from a shareholder, without a significant influx in working capital, significant revenue growth could not be assured.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010 accrued expenses consisted of the following:
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	In 2009 and 2010 the Company borrowed $1,067,500 under the terms of a convertible note payable with Remington Partners.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 the Company borrowed an additional $100,000 under the same note.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	Initially this note was convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the lenders option at the lower of $0.27 per share or a twenty-five percent (25%) discount from the next issuance of common stock by the Company.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	The original note was due on February 28, 2010.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S4	In March 2010, the note was amended to change the due date to June 30, 2010 and the maximum amount of the Note was increased to $1 Million.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S5	In July, 2010, the Note-holder notified the Company of its intention to convert the Note, upon the Company completing a financing of at least $1.5 million.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S6	In February 2011, the Note was amended to increase the maximum amount to $2.0 million, to change the due date to August 31, 2011 and to allow the Company the option to convert the Note once it has raised $500,000 in new equity.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P46_S7	In October 2011, the note was again amended to change the due date to August 31, 2012.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	All three notes accrue interest at the rate of 8% per annum.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	They are due on May 12, 2012, June 12, 2012, and September 5, 2012 respectively.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	These notes are convertible by the holder after 180 days at 65% of the average of the lowest five closing bid prices in the ten trading day period before the conversion.
1434110_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	The note has no financial covenants.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company shall have the right, at any time, to redeem the Notes in whole and pay to Tripod 125% of the then unpaid principal amount of the Notes.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.

1434110_12_ITEM15_P83_S3	Based on consideration of these items, Management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2011.

1434110_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Since 2010 and until recently, we were engaged exclusively in the on-demand e-commerce line of business.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	On February 4, 2013, we commenced operations in a second line of business by effecting a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	( Novas ), under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Novas has an exclusive license for the right to engage in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	This technology has to date only been used outside of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	While our primary focus has now shifted to the further development of our oil recovery technology; we intend to continue to carry on our on-demand e-commerce line of business while we evaluate the opportunities in the oil recovery line of business.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our principal offices are located at 1701 Commerce Street, Houston, Texas 77002.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our telephone number is (713) 227-0480.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (fka Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	(the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012).
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P4_S5	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	On July 6, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 5,000,000 shares as Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	On August 17, 2012, we filed and amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, which increased the number of shares of our authorized common stock to 500,000,000 shares, effectuated a 50:1 reverse split of the number of shares of our outstanding common stock and changed our name to Propell Technologies Group.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	On February 4, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Novas and Novas became our wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into an exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing license agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which granted Novas the right to practice in the United States the proprietary process of the Licensor and utilize its apparatus for enhanced oil production.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the technology to provide services to third parties and for itself as well, and to sublicense the technology in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Although it has never been utilized in the United States, the process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States for several years.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of its technology in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The process utilizes a downhole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	The technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells and also horizontal wells.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the 3 rd quarter of 2013 and anticipate testing the new horizontal tool in the 4 th quarter of 2013.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone and increase the permeability of the reservoir at the same time.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	The tool has also been used (in Russia) in the completion of new vertical well drills instead of a completion frack and results have been shown to be similar to fracking.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	The process once applied should be effective for approximately nine months to one year and thereafter can be reapplied as needed.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The success of our application of our enhanced oil technology largely depends upon the correct selection of candidate wells.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	The candidate well requirements are: no behind the casing flow; well bore inclination does not exceed 50 degrees; reservoir temperature is less than 110 degrees Celsius, porosity is no more than 30 degrees; permeability is at least 2-4mD; reservoir pressure is below 500 atm; presence of a drilling sump; fluid in the hole above the perforations, the number of perforation holes is greater than 10 per meter and the reservoir pressure is greater than the saturation pressure.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Additionally when selecting a target well or oil field we look at the various formations such as limestone, sandstone, tight sand, dolomite, shale or clay.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We look at well logs and do analysis on the reservoir drive system (water, gas, gravity) and water cuts.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Depending upon our analysis of a candidate well we develop a unique treatment plan.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	As an example a softer rock such as dolomite may receive 20 plasma pulses in each 12 -18 inch perf zone compared to a tight sand where we may release 50 or more plasma pulses.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	We may also vary the time in between pulses and the frequency and size of the pulses.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our initial target customer is one with several smaller marginal or stripper oil wells that have experienced reduced oil production.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We believe that the U.S. target market is indeed large since according to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission s (IOGCC) 2009 production report there were 394,202 marginal wells producing 275,409,538 barrels of oil per day.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	IOGCC defines a marginal or stripper well as a well that the produces 10 barrels of oil or 60 Mcf (1,000 cubic feet) of natural gas per day or less.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Generally, these wells started their productive life producing much greater volumes using natural pressure.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	Over time, the pressure decreases and production drops.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S5	That is not to say that the reservoirs, which feed the wells, are necessarily depleted.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P13_S6	We also intend to target newer wells that were drilled in the last 10 years that have experienced declined production.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We also intend to enter into the new vertical well service segment to compete with fracking and acidizing competitions.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Total U.S. drilling in 2011 was 44,732 and that number is forecasted to remain constant for the next 5 years according to the 2013 World Oil Oil Gas Industry Forecast.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Of the approximately 45,000 total wells drilled in 2012 we estimated that 31,500 or 70.0% were oil wells and the remainder were gas wells that are not our target.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Of the 31,500 oil wells drilled approximately 15,750 or 50% were vertical wells.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	We believe that the size of the market will continue to grow for our technology as we already have the ability to treat certain existing wells, and we estimate that approximately 43 new wells are being drilled every day.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Initially, we intend to derive revenue from customers based upon a percent of their increased oil production revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	We intend to provide customers with a free demonstration of our technology at one of their sites with an agreement that if successful and there is an oil recovery gain that we will share in the increased revenue derived from such gain.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	Alternatively, we also intend to perform enhancement services for customers for a fixed fee per well or to sublicense the technology to others who will perform the services that we would otherwise perform and pay us a fee for such sublicense.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition, we may seek to acquire underperforming wells and use the technology on the wells we acquire to produce revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from Novas Energy Group Limited, the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well as to sublicense the technology in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	The license is limited to the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the license agreement) and Non-Royalty Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three year anniversary of the license agreement.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S4	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S5	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid, Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S6	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S7	Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P17_S8	If Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	On August 20, 2012, the Licensor filed a Provisional Patent Application (No. 61/684,988 entitled Process and Apparatus For The Production Enhancement of Hydrocarbon Deposits Using Metallic Plasma-Generated, Directed, Nonlinear, Wide-Band and Elastic Oscillations at Resonance Frequencies) with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	To date, we have presented our technology at several conferences focused on worldwide energy concerns.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have presented at Energy Prospectus Group, the Winter North American Prospect Expo (NAPE) and HIS CERAWeek 2013.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Typically oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	In addition, legislation introduced in Congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	Further, on May 4, 2012, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for "small" glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	We are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	In addition, Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state's Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The term "waters of the United States" has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Competition in the oil industry is intense.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods, As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	We also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	In our on-demand e-commerce business we enable turnkey e-commerce web sites for education, military and media partners under the registered trademark PropellShops in which we sell apparel and other merchandise branded with the organization s logo or other artwork, providing all necessary technology, on-demand manufacturing, marketing and fulfillment services at no risk or cost to its partners, and share resulting revenue with the partners.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our primary target markets are K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses, for whom the company provides a wide selection of options for customized apparel, uniforms, and other merchandise.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Most products are created on demand, meaning they are manufactured as ordered, so there is no finished inventory required.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	While we work with some independent groups and individuals, our business model is based upon the formation of strategic partnerships with key targeted companies involved in each of our target markets in order to obtain access to a large number of customers.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The PropellShops system permits partners with little or no technical or graphic expertise to quickly become Store Owners and have online shops displaying a wide variety of personalized apparel and other merchandise featuring the school or organization s brand or other artwork.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Store Owner then publicizes the shop to its potential customers, and Propell does all manufacturing, billing, customer support and shipping.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Since Propell does not charge a set-up fee for e-commerce shops, and merchandise is only manufactured when ordered, the PropellShops system eliminates almost all risk or investment for Store Owners.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	They carry no inventory, and Propell handles all fulfillment.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Further, Propell s on-demand system also eliminates minimum order quantities and long lead times.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Propell collects all revenue and then distributes a share of every sale to the Store Owner.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our particular focus on the school market is driven by the size of the market and our belief that this category is underserved by current providers of our type of on-demand merchandise.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	There are over 130,000 K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics most recent report, as well as more than 6,000 post-secondary schools.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	While most schools already offer school gear purchased in quantity, we believe each of these institutions is a candidate for our type of on-demand merchandise service, since unlike traditional apparel and merchandise printing methods, it requires no upfront investment in inventory, and can be personalized with no minimum quantities.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our PropellShops operation, including its transmission of digital images over the Internet, is subject to regulation by the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission and various states, local, and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Congress has enacted legislation to specifically regulate online commerce and communications and has addressed such issues as the transmission of certain materials to children, intellectual property protection, and taxation.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Other legislation could result in additional regulation or prohibition of the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	This regulation could limit the type of business we pursue or increase the costs to ensure compliance.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We deliver our products and services through a diverse set of online partners, including K-12 schools, universities, newspapers, musical groups, military through the Navy Exchange Command and small and large businesses.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Competition in online photo and merchandise space takes several forms.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Photo sharing web sites are designed for consumers and are optimized for sharing and printing photos, and creating photo merchandise from those images.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Competitors include Shutterfly, Snapfish, Photobucket, Webshots, and social networking sites such Facebook, as well as the web sites of photo retailers such as Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	More closely, we compete with image merchandise sites that allow artists, consumers and small businesses to create their own custom web stores featuring selected images.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Competitors include Zazzle, Cafepress and Threadless, as well as school merchandise e-commerce sites such as Prep Sportswear.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	In the school market, there is also fragmented completion from local screen printers and similar suppliers with brick and mortar shops and long-standing relationships with schools.
1434110_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our PropellShops web services were created using our own technology, as well as proprietary enhancements to open source software tools.

1434110_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	This item is omitted as not required for smaller reporting companies.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our critical accounting policies, the policies we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments are outlined below in Critical Accounting Policies.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events .
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	These forward-looking statements involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, and similar expressions.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	These statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	In light of these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur and actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since 2010 and until recently, we were engaged exclusively in the on-demand e-commerce line of business.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	On February 4, 2013, we commenced operations in a second line of business by effecting a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	( Novas ), under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Novas has an exclusive license for the right to engage in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	This technology has to date only been used outside of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	While our primary focus has now shifted to the further development of our oil recovery technology; we intend to continue to carry on our on-demand e-commerce line of business while we evaluate the opportunities in the oil recover that line of business.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into an exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing license agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which granted Novas the right to practice in the United States the proprietary process of the Licensor and utilize its apparatus for enhanced oil production.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the technology to provide services to third parties and for itself as well, and to sublicense the technology in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Although it has never been utilized in the United States, the process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States for several years.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of its technology in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The process utilizes a downhole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	The technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 cased wells and also horizontal wells.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the 3 rd quarter of 2013 and anticipate testing the new horizontal tool in the 4 th quarter of 2013.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment has been attributed with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone and increase the permeability of the reservoir at the same time.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	The tool has also been used (in Russia) in the completion of new vertical well drills instead of a completion frack and results have been shown to be similar to fracking.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Initially, we intend to derive revenue from customers based upon a percent of their increased oil production revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We intend to provide customers with a free demonstration of our technology at one of their sites with an agreement that if successful and there is an oil recovery gain that we will share in the increased revenue derived from such gain.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Alternatively, we also intend to perform enhancement services for customers for a fixed fee per well or to sublicense the technology to others who will perform the services that we would perform and pay us a fee for such sublicense.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	In addition, we may seek to acquire underperforming wells and use the technology on the wells we acquire to produce revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	In our on-demand e-commerce business we enable turnkey e-commerce web sites for education, military and media partners under the registered trademark PropellShops in which we sell apparel and other merchandise branded with the organization s logo or other artwork, providing all necessary technology, on-demand manufacturing, marketing and fulfillment services at no risk or cost to its partners, and share resulting revenue with the partners.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our primary target markets are K-12 schools, universities, military, independent musicians, nonprofits and businesses, for whom the company provides a wide selection of options for customized apparel, uniforms, and other merchandise.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Most products are created on demand, meaning they are manufactured as ordered, so there is no finished inventory required.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	While we work with some independent groups and individuals, our business model is based upon the formation of strategic partnerships with key targeted companies involved in each of our target markets in order to obtain access to a large number of customers.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The PropellShops system permits partners with little or no technical or graphic expertise to quickly become Store Owners and have online shops displaying a wide variety of personalized apparel and other merchandise featuring the school or organization s brand or other artwork.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Store Owner then publicizes the shop to its potential customers, and Propell does all manufacturing, billing, customer support and shipping.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Since Propell does not charge a set-up fee for e-commerce shops, and merchandise is only manufactured when ordered, the PropellShops system eliminates almost all risk or investment for Store Owners.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	They carry no inventory, and Propell handles all fulfillment.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	Further, Propell s on-demand system also eliminates minimum order quantities and long lead times.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Propell collects all revenue and then distributes a share of every sale to the Store Owner.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We are a Delaware corporation engaged in two lines of business.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	To date, all of our revenue has been derived from our e-commerce line of business.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	We are currently evaluating this line of business and have substantially reduced our marketing activities and reduced our labor force during this evaluation period.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Our primary focus is on the commercial application of the Plasma-Pulse Technology that we license to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although the technology has only been proven outside of the United States, we are currently modifying the apparatus used by the Licensor outside of the United States so that it can be used on oil wells in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	We anticipate completion of the modified apparatus by the end of the second quarter of this year at which time we will then be able to demonstrate the technology s capability.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Initially, we expect to offer our services to independent oil wells for a percentage of the revenue that our customers derive from the additional production resulting from the use of our technology.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We may also charge a service fee for use of the technology as opposed to a percentage of revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, we may acquire wells and us the technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2012 involve the sales and operations from PropellShops since Novas was acquired subsequent to December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our current e-commerce customers include eChalk, the Los Angeles Times, the Navy Exchange Command, and numerous K-12 schools and universities, through e-commerce web sites.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	In addition, our management has a long track record of delivering a variety of consumer and photo products, services and logistics to partners, including Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite-Aid.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business during the prior year has been dependent upon us raising additional funding.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	Due to limited capital and related staff reductions, we had reduced our outbound sales and marketing activities.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P18_S5	Although we continue to accept and ship orders placed on our ecommerce web sites from existing customers, and from new customers who use our online tools to set up their own shops, our activity during the year was limited due to our financing needs.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	To date we have financed our operations from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $6,211,915 through December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this MD A, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to the individual Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or services are delivered to customers, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Net revenues include product sales net of returns and allowances.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Estimates are based on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual results may vary from those estimates.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We place our cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the FDIC insurance limit.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	We extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, generally without collateral.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	We monitor our exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses, as required.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1, Reorganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 does not include Novas since we acquired Novas after December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations, excluding discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	It also details the changes from the prior fiscal year in absolute dollars and in percentages.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	We have reported the results of operations of businesses we discontinued in 2010 [and 2011] as discontinued operations for both the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, PropellShops revenue decreased from $204,796 to $59,915 or 70.7% due to reduced sales and marketing activities due to lack of funds.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gross profit decreased from $65,922 or 32% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 to a profit of $12,999 or 22% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Gross margins became unsustainable with the Company experiencing decreased sales.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Operating expenses decreased from $1,217,938 for the year ended December 31 2011 to $546,735 for the year ended December 31 2012, due to reduced sales and general and administrative expenses.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	At the end of the fiscal year we had no operating subsidiaries.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Crystal Magic (CMI), which operated our laser etching business, ceased operations in June 2010.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our equity securities and issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $6,211,915 through December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our current tool development.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs in the next quarter.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	Due to limited capital and related staff reductions, we have reduced our outbound sales and marketing activities until such time that more working capital can be secured or is generated from sales growth.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S6	We continue to accept and ship orders placed on our ecommerce web sites from existing customers, and from new customers who use our online tools to set up their own shops.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P34_S7	However, our lack of cash makes it difficult for us to purchase necessary products and retain employees for our PropellShops.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	On October 31, 2012 and November 26, 2012, we issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $20,000 and $25,000, respectively, to an investor who is also a shareholder.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The notes accrues interest at a rate per annum of 6% and, at the option of the holder, are convertible into shares of our common stock, at the higher of $.05 per share or 50% of the average closing price of our common stock on the three days prior to the conversion date.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Effective November 20, 2012, we exchanged debt issued to two investors in the aggregate principal amount of $2,304,311 plus interest of $560,052 for two new convertible notes, one in the principal amount of $1,680,000 and the other in the principal amount of $320,000.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The notes accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum, mature on November 19, 2017 and, at the discretion of the holder, are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $.02 per share.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	During 2012, the Company raised a total of $377,500 through the issuance of preferred stock ($230,000) and convertible notes totaling $147,500.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	In addition, the Company was required to accrue certain salaries, defer rent and negotiate settlements of wages and other payables.
1434110_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_13_ITEM9_P0_S0	There have been no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure with our independent auditors for the period ended December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer who is also the Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO who also serves as the Principal Financial Officer concluded that due to a lack of segregation of duties that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P0_S4	The Company s intends to retain additional individuals to remedy the ineffective controls.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, thought not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that ended December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The COSO framework required rigid adherence to control principles that require sufficient and adequately trained personnel to operate the control system.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting were ineffective based on those criteria.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	This Annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1434110_13_ITEM13_P1_S0	In November of 2012, the Company entered into a debt for debt exchange with Joseph Abrams, a shareholder and related party of the Company.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P1_S1	Pursuant to the exchange, Mr. Abrams received a $320,000 convertible note in exchange for a non-interest bearing shareholder loan made by Mr. Abrams to the Company in the amount of $102,188 and five (5) promissory notes owned by Mr. Abrams, which notes had an aggregate balance due immediately prior to the exchange of $231,649, including interest accrued thereon of $51,649 (the five notes carried interest at the rate of 10% per annum and all five notes were in default at the time of the exchange).
1434110_13_ITEM13_P1_S2	Subsequent to the exchange Mr. Abrams assigned $250,500 of the $320,000 note to a number of private parties and retained $69,500 in the Joseph Abrams Trust.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P1_S3	Under the terms of the convertible note received by Abrams, the note is convertible at any time at a conversion price of $0.02 per share, pays interest at the rate of 6% per annum and matures on November 19, 2017.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P2_S0	During the period ending December 31, 2012 we issued two convertible notes in the principal amount of $20,000 and $25,000, respectively, to an investor who is also a shareholder.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P2_S1	The notes accrue interest at a rate per annum of 6% and, at the option of the holder, are convertible into shares of our common stock, at the higher of $.05 per share or 50% of the average closing price of our common stock on the three days prior to the conversion date.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P3_S0	During the period ending December 31, 2012, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Edward L. Bernstein, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, as payment of wages owed to Mr. Bernstein.
1434110_13_ITEM13_P4_S0	On March 6, 2013, John Zotos, our director, was also appointed to serve as the Corporate Secretary of the Company for an annual salary of $30,000 and received options exercisable for 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $.25 per share, of which 250,012 shares vested immediately and the remaining options are to vest on a monthly basis over a three-year period, subject to acceleration upon certain events.
1434110_13_ITEM14_P0_S0	On January 17, 2013, we dismissed Silberstein Unger, PLLC ( Silberstein ) as its independent registered public accounting firm, and retained Liggett, Vogt and Webb P.A. ( LVW ) as its new independent registered public accounting firm responsible for auditing its financial statements.
1434110_13_ITEM14_P1_S0	Silberstein s reports on our financial statements as of and for the two years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles except that each of those reports did contain an explanatory paragraph as to the existence of substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_13_ITEM14_P1_S1	The decision to dismiss Silberstein and the selection of LVW was unanimously approved by our board of directors.
1434110_13_ITEM14_P1_S2	During the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011, and in the subsequent interim period through January 17, 2013 (the date of dismissal of Silberstein), there were no disagreements with Silberstein, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Silberstein., would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on our financial statements for such periods.
1434110_13_ITEM14_P2_S0	The following is a summary of the fees billed to us by our independent registered public accounting firm for professional services rendered for the fiscal years 2012 and 2011:

1434110_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Propell Technologies Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1434110_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Propell Technologies Group, Inc. will continue as a going concern.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and will have to obtain additional capital to sustain operations.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P13_S3	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P13_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (fka Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,897 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,722 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P14_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved and the operations of CMI were discontinued.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Company has negative working capital, has incurred operating losses since inception, and its operating activities to date have required financing from outside institutions and related parties.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	The Company will continue to need outside financing to support its internal growth.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Management continues to seek funding to pursue its business plans.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	Such funding may be obtained in the form of debt or equity financing, debt/equity hybrid instruments (i.e., convertible debt) or a combination thereof.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	As such, the Company could incur additional leverage on its balance sheet and/or significant dilution of the current shareholders.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the financing or funding necessary to continue as a going concern.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the estimated useful lives for property and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P19_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S2	Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S3	In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S4	Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S5	Receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S6	Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P20_S7	There were no recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	These conditions not only limit our access to capital, but also make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company minimizes credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the balance did not exceed the federally insured limit.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	Items of property and equipment with costs greater than $1,000 are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, as follows:
1434110_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company has no inventory as of December 31, 2012.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company s share equivalents consist of 38,430 and 96,880 stock options for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	Since the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, all common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive; as such there is no separate computation for diluted earnings per share.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	The carrying amounts of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, due from others, inventory, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued interest, notes payable and advances related parties and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	The expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	A full valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	It is the Company s policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2012, there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.
1434110_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	On August 17, 2012 the Company effectuated a 1 for 50 reverse stock split.

1434110_13_ITEM15_P216_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Propell Technologies Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, John W. Huemoeller II , Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to Section 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1434110_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Novas Energy USA, Inc. ( Novas ), we are engaged in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil for which we have a perpetual exclusive license to utilize in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We began introducing the technology in the United States on a limited basis in March 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Prior to March 2013, all of our revenue had been derived from our e-commerce and other lines of business.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Since February 4, 2013, following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas Energy (USA), Inc. ( Novas ), under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our Common Stock, our primary focus has shifted to the further development of our licensed oil recovery technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	The oil recovery technology used by Novas is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license to engage in the commercial application of the proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology (the Technology ) entered into on January 30, 2013, with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which granted Novas the right to use the technology in the United States to enhance oil production.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the technology in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	In March 2014, the license was amended to, among other things, increase the territory in which Novas can practice the licensed process and utilize the Technology to include Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Although new to the United States and Mexico, the Plasma Pulse Technology has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of the Technology in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	The Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Since March 19, 2013, we have used the Technology to treat twenty seven oil wells located in five states; Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and Wyoming.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Technology has been shown to increase oil production in the vast majority of the wells that we have treated.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	The initial results of this treatment have been very encouraging, however the results on the wells treated may not be indicative of the results of treatment on additional wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	As such, we are continuing to monitor closely the longer-term results while, based upon the prior success from the use of Plasma-Pulse Technology outside of the United States, we expect the positive data from the treated wells in the United States to continue.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We currently have four tools that we use to perform the treatments.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the second quarter of 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	In August 2013, we signed one Oil Services Revenue Sharing Agreement to treat up to ten wells in Creek County Oklahoma and thus far have treated four wells under the agreement, which four wells are included in the twenty seven oil wells mentioned above.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The agreement provides that Novas pays for all expenses related to the treatment and is reimbursed for such expenses from the initial funds received from the increase in production until Novas expenses are paid in full and then Novas will receive 49% of the increased oil production revenue for a twelve month period after treatment of the wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	We have received some revenue and expect to receive additional revenue to at least recover some of our expenses incurred on the treatment of these wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	We have also agreed to treat four wells in Oklahoma for a service fee of which we have completed three of those treatments and have been paid on two of them.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We expect to continue to offer our services to independent oil wells based on our joint venture model in which we receive a percentage of the revenue that our customers derive from the additional production resulting from the use of our technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We also offer our services on a fee based model and charge a service fee for use of the technology as opposed to a percentage of revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, we may acquire wells and use the technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	In order to allow us to fully focus on our oil recovery business, in October 2013, we entered into a management agreement with a third party for the operation of our e-commerce business.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The terms of the management agreement provided that the third party would manage the operation of our e-commerce line of business and that the third party would be entitled to a fee equal to the revenue derived from the operations less a royalty of 10% of the net profit, if any that would be paid to us.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Inasmuch as the e-commerce line of business was not profitable after taking into account general and administrative expenses and other expenses and we believed that we did not have the finances or personnel available to us to promote such business line or increase sales, in December 2013, we disposed of this business for a consideration of 10% of the net profits of the business, up to a maximum of $100,000 earned over the next three years ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	In addition, effective December 31, 2013, in order to improve our balance sheet, we disposed of our wholly owned subsidiary, Crystal Magic, Inc., which had been inactive since June 2010 and sold the stock of Crystal Magic, Inc. to a third party for nominal consideration.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	To date we have derived $68,077 in revenue from our oil enhancement business.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Novas has financed its operations from loans it has received, which the majority of these loans were recently converted into shares of our common stock.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $5,393,672 through December 31, 2013 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our principal offices are located at 1701 Commerce Street, Houston, Texas 77002.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our telephone number is (713) 227-0480.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that the following are key attributes of our company:
1434110_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Plasma Pulse Technology treatment is fast and is typically completed in a matter of hours.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	After treatment with our licensed technology, the well goes back into production immediately.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	To date, our licensed technology has been safe with in excess of 200 wells treated with the technology with no know material damage.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our licensed technology does not use any chemicals or water.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our licensed technology has been shown to increase production as far as one mile from the treatment site.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (f/k/a Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012).
1434110_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated and effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our interest in CMI for nominal consideration.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	On July 6, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 5,000,000 preferred shares as Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	On August 17, 2012, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, which increased the number of shares of our authorized Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares, effectuated a 50:1 reverse split of the number of shares of our outstanding Common Stock and changed our name to Propell Technologies Group, Inc.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	On February 4, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Novas and Novas became our wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	Effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into an exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing license agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which was amended in March 2014 and granted Novas the right to practice, develop, use, market and commercialize the proprietary process of the Licensor, which consists of a specially designed apparatus and certain proprietary technology, methods and processes that may be applied to enhance the production of hydrocarbon deposits using metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band and elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	The amended license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Technology in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Although new to the United States and Mexico, the process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of its technology in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells and also horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the second quarter of 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	To date, we have used the Technology to treat twenty seven wells in the United States in five states; Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Seventeen of the wells experienced an increase in oil production after being treated with the Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	The average initial increase in oil production for the twenty seven wells was 295% and the average increase 60 days after treatment was 88%.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	Set forth below are more specific details of the initial results of the oil wells that we treated in the United States with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States in Russia and China.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone and increase the permeability of the reservoir at the same time.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The process once applied should be effective for approximately nine months to one year and thereafter can be reapplied as needed.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	The success of our application of our enhanced oil technology largely depends upon the correct selection of candidate wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The candidate well requirements are: no behind the casing flow; well bore inclination does not exceed 50 degrees; reservoir temperature is less than 110 degrees Celsius, porosity is no more than 30 degrees; permeability is at least 2-4mD; reservoir pressure is below 500 atm; presence of a drilling sump; fluid in the hole above the perforations, the number of perforation holes is greater than 10 per meter and the reservoir pressure is greater than the saturation pressure.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Additionally when selecting a target well or oil field we look at the various formations such as limestone, sandstone, tight sand, dolomite, shale or clay.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We look at well logs and do analysis on the reservoir drive system (water, gas, gravity) and water cuts.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Depending upon our analysis of a candidate well we develop a unique treatment plan.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	As an example a softer rock such as sandstone may receive 20 plasma pulses in each 12 - 18 inch perforation station compared to a limestone where we may release 50 or more plasma pulses.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	We may also vary the time in between pulses and the frequency and size of the pulses.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	United States crude-oil production grew by more than one million barrels a day in 2012, the largest increase in the world and the largest in United States history, jumping 14% last year to 8.9 million barrels a day, according to the Statistical Review of World Energy, an annual compilation of industry trends published by BP BP.LN -0.19% PLC for more than six decades.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	In volume terms, 2012 United States production gain of 1.04 million barrels a day surpassed the earlier biggest annual increase of 640,000 barrels per day, recorded in 1967.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to The Wall Street Journal, most of this new production is coming from dense shale-rock formations, such as the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas as a result of techniques developed in recent years to hydraulically fracture, or frack, these shale s, freeing up previously trapped oils.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is the fracturing of various rock layers by a pressurized liquid.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Some hydraulic fractures form naturally certain veins or dikes are examples and can create conduits along which gas and petroleum from source rocks may migrate to reservoir rocks.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Induced hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking, is a technique in which usually a large amount of water is mixed with sand and/or chemicals (a different technique where only chemicals are used is referred to as acidizing).
1434110_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	This mixture is injected at high pressure into faults to release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas, and coal seam gas), or other substances for extraction.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	This type of fracturing creates fractures from a wellbore drilled into reservoir rock formations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We intend to compete with other secondary fracking methods by providing to target customers the Plasma Pulse Technology for increasing oil production developed by Novas Energy Group Limited described above.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our initial target customers have been several smaller marginal or stripper oil wells that have experienced reduced oil production.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe that the United States and Mexican target market is indeed large.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Generally, these wells started their productive life producing much greater volumes using natural pressure.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Over time, the pressure decreases and production drops even if the reservoirs, which feed the wells, are not yet depleted.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also intend to target newer wells that were drilled in the last 10 years that have experienced declined production.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Of the approximately 45,000 total wells drilled in the United States during 2012 we estimated that 31,500 or 70.0% were oil wells and the remainder were gas wells that are not our target.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Of the 31,500 oil wells drilled approximately 15,750 or 50% were vertical wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	We believe that the size of the market will continue to grow for our technology as we already have the ability to treat certain existing wells, and we estimate that approximately 43 new wells are being drilled every day.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Initially, we have derived revenue from customers based upon our joint venture model in which we receive a percent of their increased oil production revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We typically provide customers with a free demonstration of our technology at one of their sites with an agreement that if successful and there is an oil recovery gain that we will share in the increased revenue derived from such gain.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	In May 2013, we entered into our first revenue share agreement with an owner of certain oil wells located in Creek County, Oklahoma, which agreement thereupon will be terminated when we receive reimbursement of our expenses.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	In August 2013, we signed one Oil Services Revenue Sharing Agreement to treat up to 10 wells in Creek County Oklahoma.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S4	The agreement provides that Novas pays for all expenses related to the treatment and is reimbursed for such expenses from the initial funds received from the increase in production until Novas expenses are paid in full and then Novas will receive 49% of the increased oil production revenue for a twelve month period after treatment of the wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S5	We received revenue from these treated wells in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S6	We have also agreed to treat four wells in Oklahoma for a service fee of which we have completed three of those treatments and have been paid on two of them.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S7	Alternatively, we also intend to perform enhancement services for customers based upon our fee based model pursuant to which we will charge a fixed fee per well or to sublicense the technology to others who will perform the services that we would otherwise perform and pay us a fee for such sublicense.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P36_S8	In addition, we may seek to acquire underperforming wells and use the technology on the wells we acquire to produce revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended in March 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide related services to third parties in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	The license is limited to the United States and Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the license agreement) and Non-Royalty Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S5	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S6	Royalties based on revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S7	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid with respect to one of the two territories, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to that particular territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P37_S8	We are obligated to pay a license fee of $150,000 on or prior to June 30, 2014 and an additional amount of $200,000 on or prior to June 30, 2015 for the additional rights under the amended license agreement.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	If Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	On August 20, 2012, the Licensor filed a Provisional Patent Application (No. 61/684,988 entitled Process and Apparatus For The Production Enhancement of Hydrocarbon Deposits Using Metallic Plasma-Generated, Directed, Non-linear, Wide-Band and Elastic Oscillations at Resonance Frequencies) with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	To date, we have presented our technology at several conferences focused on worldwide energy concerns.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have presented at Energy Prospectus Group, the Winter North American Prospect Expo (NAPE), HIS CERA Week 2013 and the Total Energy USA Conference.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Typically oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	Further, on May 4, 2012, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	We are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	In addition, Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state's Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	The term waters of the United States has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Competition in the oil industry is intense.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods, As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	We also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently focused on a new line of business and have very limited operating history and limited information.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company has recently engaged in a new business line involving its Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with our current management and structure.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our management has limited direct experience in our new lines of business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We are subject to the risks such as our ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our proposed business and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of our ability to generate revenues.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Even if we generate revenue, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We have insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends or even to make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	You should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We currently have limited revenues from our Plasma Pulse Technology and may not generate any revenue in the near future, if at all from the use of our technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We currently have generated limited revenues from the use of our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The majority of the twenty seven wells that were treated were treated as sample wells to demonstrate the ability of the Plasma Pulse Technology at no cost to the well owner.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Therefore there can be no assurance that well owners will determine that the price to be paid by our customers for our services, whether in the form of a cash payment or profit sharing arrangement, will be deemed to be reasonable and that customers will be willing to pay such price.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may not be able to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our consolidated audited financial statements, report a 2013 loss from operations of $(3,493,837) and a net loss of $(3,816,851).
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The opinion of our independent registered accounting firm on our audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2013 for Propell was qualified subject to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and the notes to our Financial Statements.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	For the year ending December 31, 2013, we had net revenues of $94,362 from our oil recovery and our e-commerce business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	For the year ending December 31, 2013, we sustained a net loss of $(3,816,651).
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	To date, we have not generated significant revenue from our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future plans and operations are dependent on our raising additional capital.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 we raised a total of $1,721,431 from financing activities, of which we received $1,599,500 in net proceeds from the sale of our long term and short term notes, the majority of which have conversion options, the remaining $121,931 was raised by the issuance of equity securities.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Subsequent to year end we raised an additional $750,000 in equity securities and a further $95,000 in convertible short term notes.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We do not believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to allow us to implement our anticipated plan of operations or meet our future anticipated cash flow requirements.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may not be able to service customers with the four down-hole tools that we currently have.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our ability to continue to service customers and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term to acquire additional apparatuses to be utilized with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We currently have only four down-hole tools.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If the tools should require repair we may be unable to service customers.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, with only four down-hole tools, we can only treat a limited number of wells at a time and are unable to treat wells on days when the down-hole tools are in transit from one customer s well to another well.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may not be able to retrofit the down-hole tool to fit a large number of well holes in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells and also horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the second quarter of 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	However, there can be no assurance that such tool will be able to be developed or if developed will be effective in treating wells in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of our Technology and products.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Plasma Pulse Technology that we license has been utilized in the United States on only a limited basis.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company has not yet generated significant revenue from the technology that it licenses and there can be no assurance that the Company s Plasma Pulse Technology will be accepted in the market or that the Company s commercialization efforts will be successful.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The results of our the application of our technology for initial well treatments may not support future well treatments and are not necessarily predictive of future long term results on the wells for which the initial data is favorable.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To date, we have applied our licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat only twenty seven wells, which treatments were performed fairly recently, and we do not have long terms results on the wells that were treated.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Of such wells, only seventeen had improved results.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Favorable results in our early treatments may not last and may not be repeated in later treatments of other wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Success in early treatments does not ensure that wells treated at a later date will be successful.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on a license to use the Plasma Pulse Technology that is material to our business and if the agreement were to be terminated, it would halt our ability to market our technology, as well as have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have a licensing agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we breach the terms of these licensing agreements, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required there under, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability to market our technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The license agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited requires us to pay minimum royalty payments of $1,000,000 per year; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to (i) December 31, 2015 with respect to Mexican operations and (ii) the three year anniversary of the license agreement with respect to the United States operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement with respect to a certain territory under certain circumstances and in certain other circumstances has the right to terminate the entire agreement.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, we are obligated to pay $150,000 to the Licensor on or prior to June 30, 2014 and an additional $200,000 on or prior to June 30, 2015 with respect to our rights in Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	To date, we have not generated enough revenue to pay the amount owed in June 2014 or any minimum royalty payments.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to make these minimum royalty payments.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any failure to make the payments would permit the licensor to terminate the license.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability to market our technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Demand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	State and local governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of oil recovery efforts on the environment.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our business and we can offer no assurances they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations and possibly our operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations and would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in several states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that include protections for proprietary information.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process if applicable to competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Existing or future laws, regulations, related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns).
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may acquire oil wells or form joint ventures or make investments in oil wells that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of oil wells.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We have no experience with acquiring oil wells or interests therein.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S7	We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P37_S8	We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	To finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our Common Stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If the price of our Common Stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, we may choose to incur additional debt in order to finance such acquisitions, which may also negatively affect our financial position.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us on wells that we acquire may not be productive.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may acquire properties upon which we believe recompletion activity will be successful.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The costs of recompleting, and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following unexpected drilling conditions:
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Certain of our future activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our amended license agreement grants us a license to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We will have limited control over the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we do not operate.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may acquire interests in oil wells that will be operated by other companies.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We will have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management, in particular John W. Huemoeller II, our Chief Executive Officer.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The loss of any key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We and they face intense competition for qualified individuals.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to implement our business plan.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The market in the oil and gas recovery industry is highly competitive.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We face competition from owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our technology and our ability to service our customers in a timely manner.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We intend to expend a significant amount of time and resources to develop additional down-hole tools and products related to our technology, and if the technology does not achieve commercial acceptance, ours operating results may suffer.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop additional down-hole tools and enhancements to our current down-hole tool.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In light of the long product development cycles, any developmental expenditure will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenues from the use of the technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The Company s ability to commercially introduce and successfully market its technology will be subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle that could delay introduction of these products.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If the Company does not achieve market acceptance of its technology, the Company s operating results will suffer.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	The Company s technology may also be priced higher than alternative competitive technologies, which may impair commercial acceptance.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P55_S5	The Company cannot predict whether its technology will achieve commercial acceptance.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Most of the Company s potential customers are owners of oil wells and are subject to risks faced by those industries.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the implementation of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, we will be subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the oil industry, such as availability of capital, weather and environmental issues, government regulation, and the uncertainty resulting from technological change.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The Company may need to depend on credit terms and lines of credit from lenders and may not generate sufficient revenue to be able to pay existing debt obligations when they come due.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Company had notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $767,525, of which $270,650 are either due on demand or by December 18, 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Each loan bears interest at rates ranging from 6%to 12% per annum.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	To date, the Company has not generated enough revenue to pay the amounts outstanding under these loans.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have no independent audit committee.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of five directors, three of whom are considered independent.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	This may hinder our Board of Directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of five directors, three of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P61_S5	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our Board of Directors, which consists of five directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the our operations or business prospects.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our Common Stock.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our Common Stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our Common Stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	There may be future dilution of our Common Stock.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In addition, holders of our convertible preferred A-1 shares have the right to convert their shares into 38,875,000 common shares; the holders of the convertible series B shares have the right to convert their shares into 7,500,000 common shares, holders of our long-term convertible notes have the right to convert their notes into 19,443,750 common shares; and holders of our short-term convertible notes have the option to convert into common shares at variable prices at discounts ranging from 50% to 65% of average trading prices immediately prior to conversion, which will result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment, (FASB ASC Topic 718-10).
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S4	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P72_S5	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTC-Bulletin Board.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends in the future.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Holders of shares of our Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or Common Stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Therefore, any return investors in our Preferred or Common Stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of Common Stock.
1434110_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.

1434110_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a Delaware corporation with principal offices located at 1701 Commerce Street, Houston, Texas 77002.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are engaged in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We began introducing the technology in the United States on a limited basis in March 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Prior to this, all of our revenue had been derived from our e-commerce and other lines of business, which we have recently discontinued, effective December 31, 2013, to enable us to focus all of our attention to our oil recovery business.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since February 4, 2013, following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our Common Stock, our primary focus has shifted to the further development of our licensed oil recovery technology.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The oil recovery technology held by Novas is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license to engage in the commercial application of the Technology entered into on January 30, 2013, with the Licensor which granted Novas the right to practice, develop, use, market and commercialize the proprietary process of the Licensor which consists of a specially designed apparatus and certain proprietary technology, methods and processes that may be applied to enhance the production of hydrocarbon deposits using metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band and elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the technology in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	In March 2014, the license was amended to, among other things, increase the territory in which Novas can practice the licensed process and utilize the Technology to Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although new to the United States, the process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States for several years.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of the Technology in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Since March 19, 2013, we have used the Technology to treat twenty seven oil wells located in five states; Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and Wyoming.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Technology has been shown to increase oil production in the vast majority of the wells that we have treated.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	The initial results of this treatment have been very encouraging, however the results on the wells treated may not be indicative of the results of treatment on additional wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	As such, we are continuing to monitor closely the longer-term results while, based upon the prior success from the use of Plasma-Pulse Technology outside of the United States, we expect the positive data from the treated wells in the United States to continue.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We currently have four tools that we use to perform the treatments.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our current technology and tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	We are currently in the process of developing a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	We anticipate the smaller diameter tool to be available in the second quarter of 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	In August 2013, we signed one Oil Services Revenue Sharing Agreement to treat up to ten wells in Creek County Oklahoma and thus far have treated four wells under the agreement, which four wells are included in the twenty seven oil wells mentioned above.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The agreement provides that Novas pays for all expenses related to the treatment and is reimbursed for such expenses from the initial funds received from the increase in production until Novas expenses are paid in full and then Novas will receive 49% of the increased oil production revenue for a twelve month period after treatment of the wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	We received revenue from these treated wells in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	We have also agreed to treat four wells in Oklahoma for a service fee of which we have completed three of those treatments and have been paid on two of them.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We expect to continue to offer our services to independent oil wells based on our joint venture model in which we receive a percentage of the revenue that our customers derive from the additional production resulting from the use of our technology.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	We may also offer our services on a fee based model and charge a service fee for use of the technology as opposed to a percentage of revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	In addition, we may acquire wells and use the technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We expect to continue to offer our services to independent oil wells for a percentage of the revenue that our customers derive from the additional production resulting from the use of our technology.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	We may also charge a service fee for use of the technology as opposed to a percentage of revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	In addition, we may acquire wells and use the technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	To date we have financed our operations, from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Novas has financed its operations from loans it has received.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $5,393,672 through December 31, 2013 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (f/k/a Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012).

1434110_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	On October 31, 2013, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with Seaside, pursuant to which Seaside has agreed to purchase and we have agreed to sell to Seaside up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock.

1434110_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	On January 16, 2014, we raised net proceeds of $95,000 by exercising our call right on the Gel Properties back end notes issued on July 30, 2013, each note having a face value of $50,000 (the Convertible Notes ) in exchange for two $50,000 back end notes (the Back End Notes ).
1434110_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Back End Notes are due and payable on June 1, 2014 and August 1, 2014 respectively.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock and each bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, which interest is payable in common stock.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The conversion price, as well as the formula for determining the number of shares needed to pay the interest on the note, is 65% of the lowest closing price for any five trading days prior to conversion or payment of interest.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Subsequent to year end, on March 27, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an individual, pursuant to which the individual agreed to purchase and we agreed to sell 75,000 shares of our newly created Series B Preferred Stock at an issue price of $10 per share for net proceeds of $750,000.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Of the total proceeds of $750,000, $550,000 was received on deposit, prior to the issuance of the Series B Preferred shares.

1434110_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	As a result of reverse merger accounting following the share exchange transaction with Novas, our results prior to the date of the merger reflect the results of Novas as the deemed acquirer.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	As a result of the fact that the inception date of Novas is June 19, 2012 Novas had no activity in the period ending December 31, 2012 other than $925 of general and administrative expenses.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	As such, we have no material financial data to present for the period ended December 31, 2012 for comparison against the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net revenues were $94,362 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net Revenue is broken down into revenue from our oil recovery business of $68,077 and revenue generated from our e-commerce shops of $26,285.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Revenue from our oil recovery business represents flat fees charged to customers for initial well treatments and cost recovery of expenses incurred to treat wells.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	The revenue from our e-commerce business remained low due to low sales volume due to the lack of adequate working capital.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	The e-commerce business was sold effective December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Cost of goods sold was $357,860 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Cost of sales from our oil recovery business amounted to $336,018; this included up-front costs incurred in the treatment of wells, engineering costs and equipment rental necessary to conduct our oil recovery business.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	These amounts were expensed as we are uncertain as to the amount of revenue we will generate from the wells we have treated.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Cost of sales from our e-commerce business amounted to $21,842 and consisted primarily of purchase from outside vendors to fulfill our e-commerce orders.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	The e-commerce business was sold effective December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Gross loss of $263,498 for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of a gross loss from our oil recovery business of $267,941, offset by a gross profit of $4,443 from our e-commerce business.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The gross loss on the oil recovery business is primarily due to the up-front costs incurred on wells prior to the generation of revenue.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The gross margin earned on our e-commerce business was 16.9%, which is in line with expectations due to the lack of working capital and consequently the lack of focus on this line of business.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	The e-commerce business was sold effective December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Total expenses of $3,230,339 consisted primarily of the following:
1434110_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Other income consists primarily of a gain of $44,125 realized on the release of an accrual for unpaid payroll liabilities which is not due and is longer required.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The profit on the disposal of the investment and assets is made up of the following:
1434110_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The disposal of the entire shareholding in Crystal Magic, Inc to a third party for $1.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Profit realized on the disposal of Propell Shops, an operating division within the Company, consisting primarily of the disposal of the intellectual Property, the trademarks and trade names and the website domain names of Propell Shops, less accrued liabilities of $4,586, for a consideration of $nil plus 10% of the net profit of Propell Shops, up to a maximum of $100,000, earned over the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The likelihood of receiving any significant further proceeds is considered remote and no provision has been made for any future profit on disposal.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Amortization of debt discount of $1,178,495 represents the annual amortization of debt discount raised on convertible notes of $311,152 and the accelerated amortization of debt discount amounting to $867,343 on notes payable which were converted into common stock during the year.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The debt discount is amortized over a five year period, the term of the convertible notes, any conversion of these notes or redemption of these notes results in an immediate amortization of the remaining debt discount associated with the note concerned.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Certain of the short-term notes with a face value of $678,278 issued during the year have variable priced conversion options, gave rise to a derivative liability of $201,382 on inception of these notes.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	This liability was reassessed at December 31, 2013, further increasing the liability by $36,417, amounting to a total liability of $237,799.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense of $176,099 includes interest on both long-term and short-term notes as well as the amortization of Original Issue Discounts and related fees on various short-term notes issued by the Company.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company incurred a net loss of $3,816,851 for the year ended December 31, 2013 which consists primarily of the various revenue and expense categories discussed above.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	As a result of reverse merger accounting following the share exchange transaction with Novas, our results prior to the date of the merger reflect the results of Novas as the deemed acquirer.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	As a result of the fact that the inception date of Novas is June 19, 2012 Novas had no activity in the period ended December 31, 2012 other than $925 of general and administrative expenses.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	As such, we have no material financial data to present for the period ended December 31, 2012 for comparison against the same period ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The results from inception are fully discussed under the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Prior to the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred administrative expenses of $925 on company formation.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from Novas Energy Group Limited, the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended on March, 2014.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide services to third parties related to the Technology in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Technology.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	The license is limited to the United States and Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the license agreement) and Non-Royalty Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	Revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S6	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S7	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid, Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to a particular territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S8	We are obligated to pay a license fee of $150,000 on or prior to June 30, 2014 and an additional $200,000 on or prior to June 30, 2015 for the additional rights under the amended license agreement.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S9	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S10	Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P51_S11	If Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The minimum commitments due under the license agreement for the next five years are summarized as follows:
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $5,393,672 through December 31, 2013 and incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business of $1,582,784.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2013 we had notes, in the principal amount outstanding of $1,250,433.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Subsequent to year end until March 31, 2013, we had converted notes in the principal amount of $224,000 into equity and had repaid notes in the principal amount of $358,908, offset by additional notes raised in the principal amount of $100,000.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	The Company does not currently have the resources to repay these loans as they become due.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	The Notes outstanding include convertible notes outstanding in the principal amount of $659,525.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P53_S6	The convertible Notes are convertible into common stock at varying discounts to closing trading prices prior to conversion (see notes 8 and 10 to the Notes to Financial Statements).
1434110_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Notes payable consisted of the following as of December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014:
1434110_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Subsequent to year end, on January 16, 2014, the Company raised net proceeds of $95,000 by exercising its call right on the Gel Properties back end notes issued on July 30, 2013, each note having a face value of $50,000 (the Convertible Notes ) in exchange for two $50,000 back end notes (the Back End Notes ).
1434110_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Back End Notes are due and payable on June 1, 2014 and August 1, 2014 respectively.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Convertible Notes are convertible into common stock of the Company and each bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, which interest is payable in common stock.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The conversion price, as well as the formula for determining the number of shares needed to pay the interest on the note, is 65% of the lowest closing price for any five trading days prior to conversion or payment of interest.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	On March 11, 2014, one of these $50,000 notes together with interest thereon and early settlement penalty was repaid for a net amount of $62,950.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Subsequent to year end, on March 27, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an individual, pursuant to which the individual agreed to purchase and we agreed to sell 75,000 Series B Shares at an issue price of $10 per share for net proceeds of $750,000.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The proceeds were primarily used to retire short-term convertible notes with a face value of $358,908 together with interest and early settlement penalties thereon, for a net amount of $466,317.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs in the next year.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our ability to continue to fulfill customer orders and expand our business is dependent upon us raising additional funding in the near term.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	We continue to develop our oil recovery business and expect revenues to start improving as the technology gains acceptance.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	We disposed of our e-commerce business effective December 31, 2013, the disposal of this business is expected to have a positive impact on our results and will enable management to focus fully on the oil recovery business.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this MD A, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note2, Accounting policies and estimates, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013, the period June 19, 2012 (Inception) to December 31, 2012 and for the period June 19, 2012 (Inception) to December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1434110_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013, the period June 19, 2012 (Inception) to December 31, 2012 and for the period June 19, 2012 (Inception) to December 31, 2013, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Propell Technologies Group, Inc., will continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	As more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and will have to obtain additional capital to sustain operations; these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 3.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (formerly known as Propell Corporation) (the Company ), is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (doing business as Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (doing business as Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,897 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,722 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved and the operations of CMI were discontinued.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S4	On February 4, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S5	( Novas ) whereby the Company exchanged 100,000,000 shares of its common stock for 100,000,000 shares of common stock in Novas.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S6	After the consummation of the share exchange, Novas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S7	As a result of the share exchange the shareholders of Novas obtained the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S8	As such, the exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of the Company and Novas was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P5_S9	The Company previously operated an on-demand e-commerce line of business which was disposed of effective December 31, 2013 to allow the Company to focus on its oil recovery technology business.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Novas, is an innovative technology and services company whose aim is to radically improve oil production by introducing modern and innovative technologies.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Novas has a unique and patented, Plasma-Pulse Treatment ( PPT ) technology, which is a new Enhanced Oil Recovery methodology and process that has been developed to be environmentally friendly, mobile, time efficient and extremely cost effective.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P6_S2	PPT has the potential to drive new and renewed revenue for energy producers and become a new standard for the entire petroleum industry.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1434110_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	All amounts referred to in the notes to the financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary in which it has a majority voting interest.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
1434110_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company s operations are carried out in the USA.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the USA and by the general state of the economy.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Any new accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	No segmental information is presented as the Company has disposed of its historical virtual trading store business which had minimal revenues.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company is focusing on developing its Novas Energy Plasma Pulse Technology for the petroleum industry.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company minimizes credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the balance did not exceed the federally insured limit.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S4	Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S5	Receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S6	Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P28_S7	There were no recoveries during the period ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company had no inventory as of December 31, 2013 or December 31, 2012.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Plant and equipment with costs greater than $1,000 are capitalized and depreciated.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:
1434110_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	A full valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	It is the Company s policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2013, there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Basic net loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Diluted net loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per share are excluded from the calculation (See Note 15, below).
1434110_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for options and warrants.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Dilution is computed by applying the if-converted method for convertible preferred shares.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Under this method, convertible preferred stock is assumed to be converted at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and preferred dividends (if any) will be added back to determine income applicable to common stock.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	The shares issuable upon conversion will be added to weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	Conversion will be assumed only if it reduces earnings per share (or increases loss per share).
1434110_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Any common shares issued as a result of the issue of stock options and warrants would come from newly issued common shares from our remaining authorized shares.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments from owners and distributions to owners.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	For the Company, comprehensive income for the periods presented includes net loss.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company, or own in aggregate, on a fully diluted basis 5% or more of the Company s stock.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company shall disclose all related party transactions.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P44_S3	All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P44_S4	Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related party.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,816,851 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,393,672.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company had a working capital deficiency of $1,110,828, including a non-cash derivative liability of $237,799 as of December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	These operating losses and working capital deficiency create an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S4	Although no assurances can be given, management of the Company believes that potential additional issuances of equity or other potential financing will provide the necessary funding for the Company to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P45_S5	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is economically dependent upon future capital contributions or financing to fund ongoing operations.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Management continues to seek funding to pursue its business plans.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Such funding may be obtained in the form of debt or equity financing, debt/equity hybrid instruments such as convertible debt, or a combination thereof.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	As such, the Company could incur additional leverage on its balance sheet and/or significant dilution of the current shareholders.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the financing or funding necessary to continue as a going concern.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Prepaid expenses consisted of the following as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

1434110_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The note payable advanced by Owl Holdings to the Company has no interest rate and is repayable on demand.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	In October 2013, Novas Energy USA, Inc, entered into an unsecured promissory note with JAZ-CEH Holdings LLC with a face value of $105,000.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The note bears interest at 7.5% per annum and matures on October 31, 2015.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	In terms of assignment agreements entered into, the following notes payable advanced to Novas Energy USA, Inc. by Pansies Limited, including accrued interest thereon of $22,074, were assigned to Strategic IR and then converted to 4,035,744 common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $0.10 per share, effective December 31, 2013:
1434110_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	These notes, each had an interest rate of 8% per annum, calculated on a 360 day year with maturity dates as disclosed above.
1434110_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Pansies Limited notes were funded pursuant to a Credit Agreement that allows for loans to be made to Novas up to an aggregate of $500,000.

1434110_14_ITEM9_P0_S0	There have been no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure with our independent auditors for the period ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P0_S4	The Company s CEO has concluded, that as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and that all material weaknesses and significant deficiencies have been completely remediated due to the retention of an additional bookkeeper and a consultant who are integrally involved in the preparation of the financial statements and all disclosure.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	This Annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1434110_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Propell Technologies Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2011 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, John Huemoeller II, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to Section 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1434110_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Novas Energy USA, Inc. ( Novas ), we are engaged in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil for which we have a perpetual exclusive license to utilize in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We began introducing the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States on a limited basis in March 2013.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Prior to March 2013, all of our revenue had been derived from our e-commerce and other lines of business which was disposed of effective December 31, 2013.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Since February 4, 2013, following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, our primary focus has shifted to the further development of our licensed oil recovery technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	The oil recovery technology used by Novas is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license (the License Agreement ) to engage in the commercial application of the proprietary Plasma-Pulse Technology (the Plasma Pulse Technology ) entered into on January 30, 2013, as amended in March 2014 and December 23, 2014 with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which granted Novas the right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States to enhance oil production.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	In March 2014, the license was amended to, among other things, increase the territory in which Novas can practice the licensed process and utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to include Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Although new to the United States and Mexico, the Plasma Pulse Technology has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Since March 19, 2013, we have used the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty oil and injector wells located in eight states; Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, California, Tennessee, Colorado and Wyoming.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology has been shown to increase oil production or injection rates in many of the wells that we have treated.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	The initial results of this treatment have been very encouraging, however the results on the wells treated may not be indicative of the results of treatment on additional wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	We currently have six tools that we use to perform the treatments, of which four only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	We developed U.S. made prototype tools to treat 4 -inch cased wells and treated three wells with the new tools.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Initially we offered our services to independent oil wells based on a joint venture model in which we received a percentage of the revenue that our customers derived from additional production resulting from the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology, we have not concluded any further agreements under this joint venture model.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also offer our services on a fee based model and charge a service fee for use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	In 2014 we treated sixteen wells for service fees.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	In addition, we may acquire wells and use the Plasma Pulse Technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells as well as major oil and oil service companies.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	In order to allow us to fully focus on our oil recovery business, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business for a consideration of 10% of the net profits of the business, up to a maximum of $100,000 earned over a three year period ending December 31, 2016.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	In addition, effective December 31, 2013, in order to improve our balance sheet, we disposed of our wholly owned subsidiary, Crystal Magic, Inc., which had been inactive since June 2010 and sold the stock of Crystal Magic, Inc. to a third party for nominal consideration.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	To date, we derived $258,104 in revenue from our oil enhancement business.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $10,412,155 through December 31, 2014 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our principal offices are located at 1701 Commerce Street, Houston, Texas 77002.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our telephone number is (713) 227-0480.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	On February 19, 2015, we entered into a Series C Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with Ervington Investment Limited, an entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus whose ultimate beneficial owner is Roman Abramovich ( Ervington ), and closed the first tranche of a private placement offering under the Purchase Agreement, raising $5,000,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of 1,525,424 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock ( Series C Preferred Stock ) at a purchase price of $3.277777778 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	We have agreed to use the net proceeds of the offering for research and development, commercialization of new products, sales and marketing, repayment of debt, accounts payable and administrative expenses.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Purchase Agreement also provides, subject to the conditions set forth therein, for the sale by us to Ervington of an additional 2,974,576 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an additional gross proceeds to us of $9,750,000.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Ervington has until May 31, 2015 to exercise the option to acquire the additional 2,974,576 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	The proceeds of the second closing are to be used by us for the acquisition, enhancement and maintenance of an oil field for deployment of our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into an Investors Rights Agreement with Ervington (the Investors Rights Agreement ).

1434110_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, James Fuller, Mark Kalow and Dan Steffens resigned from the Board of Directors effective upon the closing.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition, as a condition to the consummation of the Purchase Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designations to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware setting forth the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock, our Bylaws were amended and restated and we entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Ivan Persiyanov.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum equal to 4% of the stated price (which initially is $3.277777778) payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on our common stock, or any other class of preferred stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Subject to adjustment, each share of Series C Preferred Stock is currently convertible at the option of the holder into 26.67 shares of common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and other liquidation events (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations), holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive from proceeds remaining after distribution to our creditors and prior to the distribution to holders of common stock or any other class of preferred stock the (x) stated value (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) held by such holder and (y) all accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to certain weighted average anti-dilution protection as specified in the Series C Certificate of Designations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Generally holders of Series C Preferred Stock will, on an as-converted basis, vote together with the common stock as a single class.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Upon the issuance of at least 1,500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock as a class are entitled to elect either two directors holding one vote or one director holding two votes.

1434110_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	During June and August of 2014, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of $1,103,000 pursuant to a private placement agreement and individual securities purchase agreements entered into with new, qualified investors who acquired 7,353,329 of our units (the Units ) at a price of $0.15 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase one half of a share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	We paid share issue expenses of $156,890, resulting in net proceeds of $946,110.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	We also issued the placement agent and its employees a warrant exercisable for an aggregate of 1,102,999 Units at an exercise price of $0.15 per Unit, each Unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one half of a share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	Each investor also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with us under which we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) registering the common stock and shares of common stock underlying the warrants, which registration statement was declared effective on October 31, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	In March 2014, we raised $750,000 pursuant to an agreement entered into with an individual whereby we sold and he acquired 75,000 shares of our Convertible Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock ) at an issue price of $10 per share for net proceeds of $750,000.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	These proceeds were primarily used to settle short-term convertible notes for aggregate proceeds of $532,025, including interest, early settlement penalties, fees and original issue discounts thereon.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, at any time, into one hundred shares of our common stock and each holder of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on all matters that the common stock votes upon on an as converted basis.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to a liquidation preference equal to 120% of the stated value which is subordinate to payments to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock; however in connection with the consummation of the transactions under the Purchase Agreement, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has agreed to vote to subordinate the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preferences to the Series C Preferred Stock preferences.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend payable, at our election, in cash or shares of our common stock, at a rate of 8% per annum.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that the following are key attributes of our company:
1434110_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our licensed technology has been shown to increase production as far as one mile from the treatment site.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (f/k/a Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012).
1434110_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated and effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our interest in CMI for nominal consideration.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	On July 6, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 5,000,000 preferred shares as Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	On August 17, 2012, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, which increased the number of shares of our authorized Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares, effectuated a 50:1 reverse split of the number of shares of our outstanding common stock and changed our name to Propell Technologies Group, Inc.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	On February 4, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Novas and Novas became our wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	Effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S4	On March 14, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 500,000 preferred shares as Series B Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P28_S5	On February 17, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 4,500,000 preferred shares as Series C Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into the exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing License Agreement with the Licensor which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014 that granted Novas the right to practice, develop, use, market and commercialize the proprietary process of the Licensor, which consists of a specially designed apparatus and certain proprietary technology, methods and processes that may be applied to enhance the production of hydrocarbon deposits using metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band and elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The amended License Agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The amended License Agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Although new to the United States and Mexico, the process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of its technology in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Most of our tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	We developed U.S. made tools to treat 4 -inch cased wells and have recently begun using the tools.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	To date, we have used the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the United States in eight states; Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California, Tennessee, Colorado and Texas.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Many of the wells experienced an increase in oil production or injection rates after being treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Due to the fact that several wells we have treated had no prior operating history, operators that pay for the service are not required to deliver data and others have required that we maintain the confidentiality of the results of our treatments, we are unable to disclose the percent increase in oil production resulting from use of our technology for all wells that we have treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	On September 18, 2014, Novas entered into an exclusive limited use agreement with Pozotech Inc. ( Pozotech ), which was amended on December 23, 2014, for the exclusive right to the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Pozotech has established relationships with certain companies in the oil industry in Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	The terms of the use agreement allow Pozotech to retain a commission per well for each well treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology due to an introduction made by Pozotech and Pozotech pays Novas a flat fee of $25,000 per well treated upon its receipt of payment.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Novas has the right to terminate the agreement upon three months prior written notice and if so terminated Pozotech may continue to use the Plasma Pulse Technology to perform its obligations under third party contracts then in effect but may not enter into new contracts with respect to the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States in Russia and China.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone and clean up the permeability of the reservoir simultaneously.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The success of our application of our enhanced oil technology largely depends upon the selection of candidate wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The ideal candidate well requirements are as follows:
1434110_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	the reservoir pressure is greater than the saturation pressure.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Additionally when selecting a target well or oil field we analyze the various soil formations such as limestone, sandstone, tight sand, dolomite, shale or clay.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	We also analyze well logs and the reservoir drive system (water, gas, gravity) and water cuts.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	Depending upon our analysis of a candidate well we develop a unique treatment plan which includes the frequency, timing and magnitude of the plasma pulses.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	United States crude-oil production grew by more than one million two hundred thousand barrels per day in 2013, the largest increase in the world and the largest in United States history, jumping 11% last year to 12.3 million barrels a day, according to Energy International Statistics (EIA.gov).
1434110_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	In volume terms, 2013 United States production gain of 1.23 million barrels a day surpassed the earlier biggest annual increase of 990,000 barrels per day, recorded in 2012.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	According to The Wall Street Journal, most of this new production is coming from dense shale-rock formations, such as the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas as a result of techniques developed in recent years to hydraulically fracture, or frack, these shale s, freeing up previously trapped oils.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is the fracturing of various rock layers by a pressurized liquid.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Some hydraulic fractures form naturally certain veins or dikes are examples and can create conduits along which gas and petroleum from source rocks may migrate to reservoir rocks.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Induced hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking, is a technique in which usually a large amount of water is mixed with sand and/or chemicals (a different technique where only chemicals are used is referred to as acidizing).
1434110_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	This mixture is injected at high pressure into faults to release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas, and coal seam gas), or other substances for extraction.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	This type of fracturing creates fractures from a wellbore drilled into reservoir rock formations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We intend to compete with other secondary work over and rework methods by providing target customers with our Plasma Pulse Technology for increasing oil production, which we have licensed and further enhanced, as described above.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our initial target customers were smaller marginal or stripper oil wells that have experienced reduced oil production.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	In 2014, we treated seven wells for major oil companies under non-disclosure agreements.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe that the United States and Mexican target market is substantial.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	Generally, our target customers have wells that produced much greater volumes using natural pressure which has declined over time as pressure decreases even though the reservoirs which feed the wells are not yet depleted.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P46_S5	We also intend to target newer wells that were drilled in the last 10 years that have experienced production declines.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Of the approximately 45,000 total wells drilled in the United States during 2012 we estimated that 31,500 or 70.0% were oil wells and the remainder gas wells that are not part of our target market.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Of the 31,500 oil wells drilled approximately 15,750 or 50% were vertical wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	We believe that the size of the market will continue to grow for our technology as we already have the ability to treat certain existing wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	However due to the recent drop in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December 2014 to $45 per barrel on March 20, 2015, the number of drilling rigs have fallen by 734 from 1,803 on March 20, 2014 to 1,069 on March 20, 2015 (Baker Hughes Rig Counts).
1434110_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	Therefore the number of new wells that will be drilled in 2015 will be considerably less than the last few years.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Initially, in 2013, we derived revenue from customers based upon a joint venture model in which we received a percent of their increased oil production revenue.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We typically provided customers with a free demonstration of our technology at one of their sites with an agreement that if successful and there was an oil recovery gain that we would share in the increased revenue derived from such gain.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	Since then we have been treating wells for a service fee and in 2014 we treated sixteen wells for service fees.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	We also intend to perform enhancement services for customers based upon a fee based model pursuant to which we will charge a fixed fee per well or sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology to others who will perform the services under Joint Ventures that we would otherwise perform and pay us a fee for such sublicense.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In addition, upon exercise by Ervington of its option under the Purchase Agreement to acquire additional Series C Preferred Stock, we intend to acquire one or more underperforming wells and use the Plasma Pulse Technology on the wells we acquire to produce revenue; however, there can be no assurance that Ervington will exercise its option to acquire additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Without the proceeds we expect to receive upon the exercise of the option, it will be unlikely that we will have the financing available to acquire underperforming wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Plasma Pulse Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide related services to third parties in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	The license is limited to the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S4	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S5	Under certain circumstances, we have the right to make additional cash payments to cover certain royalty payment deficiencies.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S6	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S7	Royalties based on revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P51_S8	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid with respect to one of the two territories, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to that particular territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	We are obligated to pay a license fee of $200,000 on or prior to June 30, 2015 for the additional rights under the first amendment to the license agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	The Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	If the Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the Plasma Pulse Technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	On August 20, 2012, the Licensor filed a Provisional Patent Application (No. 61/684,988 entitled Process and Apparatus For The Production Enhancement of Hydrocarbon Deposits Using Metallic Plasma-Generated, Directed, Non-linear, Wide-Band and Elastic Oscillations at Resonance Frequencies) with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	To date, we have presented our technology at several conferences focused on worldwide energy concerns.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We have presented at Energy Prospectus Group, the Winter North American Prospect Expo (NAPE), GHS 100 Energy Conference, HIS CERA Week 2013 and the Total Energy USA Conference.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Typically oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	Further, on May 4, 2012, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (e.g., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S4	We are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P57_S5	Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	In addition, Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state's Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	(b) OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The term waters of the United States has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Competition in the oil industry is intense.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1_P66_S3	We also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves a high degree of risk.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our Company.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently focused on a new line of business and have very limited operating history and limited information.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have recently engaged in a new business line involving its Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with our current management and structure.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our management has limited direct experience in our new lines of business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We are subject to the risks such as our ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our proposed business and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of our ability to generate revenues.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Even if we generate revenue, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We have insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends or even to make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	You should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We currently have limited revenues from our Plasma Pulse Technology and may not generate any revenue in the near future, if at all, from the use of our technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We currently have generated limited revenues from the use of our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The majority of the wells that were treated were treated as sample wells to demonstrate the ability of the Plasma Pulse Technology at no cost to the well owner.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Therefore there can be no assurance that well owners will determine that the price to be paid by our customers for our services, whether in the form of a cash payment or profit sharing arrangement, will be deemed to be reasonable and that customers will be willing to pay such prices.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For the year ending December 31, 2014, we had net revenues of $190,035 from our oil recovery business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	For the year ending December 31, 2014, we sustained a net loss of $5,018,483.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	To date, we have not generated significant revenue from our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our future plans and operations are dependent on our raising additional capital.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014 we raised a total of $1,103,000 from our private placement that was consummated during June, July and August of 2014 and $750,000 from the sale of our Series B Preferred Stock in March 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Subsequent to year-end we raised an additional $5,000,000 from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock to Ervington and Ervington has an option until May 31, 2015 to acquire an additional $9,750,000 worth of Series C Preferred Stock; however there can be no assurance that Ervington will exercise its option.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may not be able to service customers with the five tools that we currently have.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our ability to continue to service customers and expand our business is dependent upon us acquiring additional apparatuses to be utilized with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We currently have four down-hole tools that can treat 5 inch cased wells and one new tool that treats 4 -inch cased wells and horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If the tools should require repair we may be unable to service customers.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, with only five tools, we can only treat a limited number of wells at a time and are unable to treat wells on days when the tools are in transit from one customer s well to another well.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, only one of the tools can treat the 4 -inch cased wells and horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may not be able to retrofit the down-hole tool to fit a large number of well holes in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Four of our tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We recently developed a tool to treat 4 -inch cased wells and also horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such tool will be effective in treating wells in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of the Plasma Pulse Technology and products.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Plasma Pulse Technology that we license has been utilized in the United States on a limited basis.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have not yet generated significant revenue from the Plasma Pulse Technology that it licenses and there can be no assurance that the Plasma Pulse Technology will be accepted in the market or that our commercialization efforts will be successful.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The results of our the application of our technology for initial well treatments may not support future well treatments and are not necessarily predictive of future long term results on the wells for which the initial data is favorable.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	To date, we have applied our licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells, which treatments were performed fairly recently, and we do not have long terms results on the wells that were treated.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Of such wells, we have seen improvement results in many wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Favorable results in our early treatments may not last and may not be repeated in later treatments of other wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Success in early treatments does not ensure that wells treated at a later date will be successful.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Additionally, collecting treatment data results is not always possible as operators that pay for the service are not required to deliver data or we are required to work under non-disclosure agreements.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We rely on a license to use the Plasma Pulse Technology that is material to our business and if the agreement were to be terminated, it would halt our ability to market our technology, as well as have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have a License Agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If we breach the terms of this agreement, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability to market the Plasma Pulse Technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The License Agreement with Novas Energy Group Limited requires us to pay aggregate minimum royalty payments of $1,000,000 per year; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to (i) December 31, 2015 with respect to Mexican operations and (ii) the three year anniversary of the license agreement with respect to the United States operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement with respect to a certain territory under certain circumstances and in certain other circumstances has the right to terminate the entire agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, we are obligated to pay an additional $200,000 on or prior to June 30, 2015 with respect to our rights in Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	To date, we have not generated enough revenue to pay minimum royalty payments.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue to make these minimum royalty payments.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Any failure to make the payments would permit the Licensor to terminate the license.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability to market our technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives Ervington effective control of us, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Ervington currently beneficially owns approximately 22.3% of our voting shares on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments) and has an option to acquire an additional 2,974,576 shares of Series C Preferred Stock from us; 700,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and 56,677,477 shares of common stock from certain of our stockholders.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If the option is fully exercised, Ervington will beneficially own 50.9% of our voting stock on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments).
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, Ervington currently has the right to appoint two board members and if it fully exercises its option it will have the right to appoint three board members, which shall constitute a majority of our board of directors.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result of these appointment rights and its voting control of our company, Ervington has the power to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors, our business strategy, our day-to-day operations and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Ervington s control of our company could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, preventing a change in control of our company that might be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders, and possibly depress the trading price of our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to Ervington s ownership and control of our company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Demand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The recent decline in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December 2014 to $45 per barrel in March 2015 has resulted in a decline in oil drilling rigs which has depressed the immediate level of exploration, development, and production activity which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	State and local governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of oil recovery efforts on the environment.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our business and we can offer no assurances they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations and possibly our operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations and would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in several states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that include protections for proprietary information.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process if applicable to competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Existing or future laws, regulations, related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns).
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may acquire oil wells or form joint ventures or make investments in oil wells that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue acquisitions of oil wells.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In fact, Ervington s exercise of its option to acquire additional shares of our Series C Preferred Stock is conditioned upon us identifying an oil field for acquisition and having entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of such oil field.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We have no experience with acquiring oil wells or interests therein.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S8	We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P37_S9	We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We intend to use the proceeds of our second closing with Ervington to finance our initial oil field acquisition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	To finance any additional acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, we may choose to incur additional debt in order to finance such acquisitions, which may also negatively affect our financial position.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us on wells that we acquire may not be productive.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may acquire properties upon which we believe recompletion activity will be successful.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The costs of recompleting, and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following unexpected drilling conditions:
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Certain of our future activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our amended license agreement grants us a license to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We will have limited control over the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we do not operate.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may acquire interests in oil wells that will be operated by other companies.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We will have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management, in particular John W. Huemoeller II, our Chief Executive Officer.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The loss of any key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We and they face intense competition for qualified individuals.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to implement our business plan.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The market in the oil and gas recovery industry is highly competitive.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We face competition from owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our technology and our ability to service our customers in a timely manner.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We intend to expend a significant amount of time and resources to develop additional down-hole tools and products related to our technology, and if the Plasma Pulse Technology does not achieve commercial acceptance, ours operating results may suffer.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop additional down-hole tools and enhancements to our current down-hole tool.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In light of the long product development cycles, any developmental expenditure will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenues from the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market our Plasma Pulse Technology will be subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle that could delay introduction of these products.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If we do not achieve market acceptance of our technology, our operating results will suffer.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Our technology may also be priced higher than alternative competitive technologies, which may impair commercial acceptance.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We cannot predict whether our technology will achieve commercial acceptance.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Most of our potential customers are owners of oil wells and are subject to risks faced by those industries.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the implementation of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, we will be subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the oil industry, such as availability of capital, weather and environmental issues, government regulation, and the uncertainty resulting from technological change.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We have no separate independent audit committee.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of three directors, none of whom are considered to be independent.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	This may hinder our Board of Directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of three directors, one of whom who has two votes and none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our Board of Directors, which does not have a majority of independent directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Trading on the OTCQB may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	There may be future dilution of our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If Ervington exercises its option to acquire additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, holders of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares into 35,125,000 shares of common stock and; the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to convert his shares into 7,500,000 common shares and Ervington, the sole holder of the Series C Preferred Stock has the right to convert its shares of series C Preferred Stock into 40,677,973 shares of common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P68_S3	We also have warrants outstanding that are convertible into 6,339,498 shares of our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow the accounting standards on share based payments.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S4	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P70_S5	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTCQB.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Our management discovered insufficient controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions and a lack of segregation of duties.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 4% per annum of the stated price which initially is $3.277777778 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, our Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum of the stated price which initially is $10.00 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Other than dividend payments on the preferred stock we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	In the event of such an issuance, the Preferred Stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over the then current market price per share.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S5	We currently have 3,512,500 Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding, 75,000 Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and have recently designated 4,500,000 preferred shares as Series C Preferred Stock, of which 1,525,424 are outstanding and Ervington has an option to acquire the remaining 2,974,576 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S6	The Series C Preferred Stock has the right to annual dividends in preference to all other preferred stock and the common stock and the Series B Preferred Stock is also entitled to an annual dividend.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S7	The Series A-1, B and C Preferred Stock all have liquidation preferences over the common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S8	In addition the vote of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock will be required for the (i) merger, sale of substantially all of our assets or our recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (ii) redemption or acquisition of shares of our common stock other than in limited circumstances, (iii) declaration or payment of a dividend or distribution with respect to our capital stock, (iv) making any loan or advance, (v) amending our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (vi) authorizing or creating any new class or series of equity security, (vii) increasing the number of authorized shares for issuance under any existing stock or option plan, (viii) materially changing the nature of the business, (ix) incurring any indebtedness, (x) engaging in or making investments not authorized by the Board of Directors, (xi) acquiring or divesting a material amount of assets (xii) selling, assigning, licensing, pledging or encumbering our material technology or intellectual property, and (xiii) entering into any corporate strategic relationship involving payment, contribution or assignment by us or to us of any assets.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P84_S9	The vote of two-thirds of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is also required to take certain actions similar to those set forth above.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	If we fail to meet the new eligibility requirements of the OTC Market Group, we will no longer be eligible to have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	If we fail to maintain a minimum bid price of $.01 per share one day per each thirty consecutive days, our stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on the OTCQB and will be traded on the pink sheets.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Effective May 1, 2014, the OTC Market Group implemented new eligibility standards for companies traded on the OTCQB that will be gradually phased in over a one year period.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Investors of companies that do not meet the eligibility requirements will not have the benefit of the additional disclosure requirements of the OTCQB and trading may be more difficult.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, and other information with the SEC.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	You may read and copy any document we file at the SEC s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	You may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the public reference room.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information that issuers (including Propell) file electronically with the SEC.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The SEC s website is www.sec.gov .
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	It provides a link to the SEC s website at www.sec.gov that provides, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; current reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports and forms.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We will voluntarily provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request.
1434110_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1434110_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We sub-leases approximately 1,800 square feet of loft space in Houston, Texas from a related party for a one year lease which commenced on September 1, 2014 and expires August 31, 2015 for $3,220 per month.
1434110_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We sub-leases approximately 1800 square feet of loft space in Houston, Texas from a related party for a one year lease which commenced on September 1, 2014 and expires August 31, 2015 for $3,220 per month.
1434110_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no material legal proceedings that are pending or have been threatened against us of which management is aware.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin board since April 23, 2010 under the symbol PROP.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that date, there was no active market for our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for our common stock for the periods indicated.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin board on March 23, 2015 was $0.18 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of March 23, 2015, there were approximately 118 holders of record of our common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we have no intention of paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a Delaware corporation with principal offices located at 1701 Commerce Street, Houston, Texas 77002.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are engaged in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	We began introducing the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States on a limited basis in March 2013.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Prior to this, all of our revenue had been derived from our e-commerce and other lines of business, which we discontinued, effective December 31, 2014, to enable us to focus all of our attention to our oil recovery business.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since February 4, 2013, following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, our primary focus has been to the further development of our licensed oil recovery technology.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology used by Novas is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license to engage in the commercial application of the proprietary Plasma Pulse Technology entered into on January 30, 2013, as amended in March 2014 and December 23, 2014 with Novas Energy Group Limited, as licensor which granted Novas the right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States to enhance oil production.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The License Agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	In March 2014, the License Agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the territory in which Novas can practice the licensed process and utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to include Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although new to the United States and Mexico, the Plasma Pulse Technology has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Licensor has filed for patent protection of the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Since March 19, 2013, we have used the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty oil and injector wells located in eight states; Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, California, Tennessee, Colorado and Wyoming.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology has been shown to increase oil production or injection rates in many of the wells that we have treated.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The initial results of this treatment have been very encouraging, however the results on the wells treated may not be indicative of the results of treatment on additional wells.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	We currently have six tools that we use to perform the treatments, of which four only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	We developed U.S. made prototype tools to treat 4 -inch cased wells and treated 3 wells with the new tools.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We offer our services on a fee based model and charge a service fee for use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, we may acquire wells and use the Plasma Pulse Technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our anticipated customers are the owners of independent oil wells and major oil and oil service companies.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	In order to allow us to fully focus on our oil recovery business, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business for a consideration of 10% of the net profits of the business, up to a maximum of $100,000 earned over the three years ended and ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, effective December 31, 2013, in order to improve our balance sheet, we disposed of our wholly owned subsidiary, Crystal Magic, Inc., which had been inactive since June 2010 and sold the stock of Crystal Magic, Inc. to a third party for nominal consideration.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	To date, we derived $258,104 in revenue from our oil enhancement business.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and should we require additional funding we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $10,412,155 through December 31, 2014 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	On February 19, 2015, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Ervington and closed the first tranche of a private placement offering under the Purchase Agreement, raising $5,000,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of 1,525,424 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $3.277777778 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	We have agreed to use the net proceeds of the offering for research and development, commercialization of new products, sales and marketing, repayment of debt, accounts payable and administrative expenses.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Purchase Agreement also provides, subject to the conditions set forth therein, for the sale by us to Ervington of an additional 2,974,576 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an additional gross proceeds to us of $9,750,000.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	The proceeds of the second closing are to be used by us for the acquisition, enhancement and maintenance of an oil field for deployment of our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	On October 31, 2014, we issued a note in the principal amount of $107,000 to LG Capital Funding, LLC ( LG ) upon receipt of $100,000 from LG.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	This note was subsequently repaid on February 20, 2015.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	The conversion price, as well as the formula for determining the number of shares needed to repay the note and any interest thereon is 58% of the average of the lowest closing price for any three trading days during the last ten day trading period prior to conversion or payment of interest.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	This note was subsequently repaid on February 20, 2015.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	During June and August of 2014, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of $1,103,000 pursuant to a private placement agreement and individual securities purchase agreements entered into with new, qualified investors who acquired 7,353,329 of our units at a price of $0.15 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase one half of a share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	We paid share issue expenses of $156,890, resulting in net proceeds of $946,110.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	In March 2014, we raised $750,000 pursuant to an agreement entered into with an individual whereby we sold and he acquired 75,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at an issue price of $10 per share for net proceeds of $750,000.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	These proceeds were primarily used to settle short-term convertible notes for aggregate proceeds of $532,025, including interest, early settlement penalties, fees and original issue discounts thereon.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	On January 16, 2014, we raised net proceeds of $95,000 by exercising our call right on the Gel Properties back end notes issued on July 30, 2013, each note having a face value of $50,000 (the Convertible Notes ) in exchange for two $50,000 back end notes (the Back End Notes ).
1434110_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Back End Notes were due and payable on June 1, 2014 and August 1, 2014 respectively.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Convertible Notes were convertible into shares of our common stock and each bore interest at the rate of 6% per annum, which interest was payable in common stock.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The conversion price, as well as the formula for determining the number of shares needed to pay the interest on the note was 65% of the lowest closing price for any five trading days prior to conversion or payment of interest.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net revenues were $190,035 and $94,362 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively, an increase of $95,673 or 101.4%.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Revenue in the current year consists of: (i) the amortization of a once off licensing fee and initial set up revenues amounting to $40,000 for a well treatment project undertaken in Mexico, which has subsequently been terminated due to non-performance with the reversal of all deferred revenue and receivables under that project; and (ii) $150,027 earned on the treatment of several wells in the USA.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	The gross loss on the oil recovery business is primarily due to the incurrence of engineering costs prior to the generation of revenue.

1434110_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The disposal of the entire shareholding in Crystal Magic, Inc. to a third party for $1.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Profit realized on the disposal of Propell Shops, an operating division within our company, consisting primarily of the disposal of the intellectual Property, the trademarks and trade names and the website domain names of Propell Shops, less accrued liabilities of $4,586, for a consideration of 10% of the net profit of Propell Shops, up to a maximum of $100,000, earned over the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	To date we have not received any proceeds and now believe that the likelihood of receiving any significant further proceeds is considered remote and no provision has been made for any future profit on disposal.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Amortization of debt discount and finance costs was $527,830 and $1,354,594 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the current year includes a penalty interest of $122,399 on the early settlement of convertible debt before conversion took place, the amortization of debt discount on long-term notes of $295,979 which includes the accelerated amortization of debt discount on long term notes which were converted into common stock during the current year, the amortization of $56,913 on short-term convertible notes which was also accelerated due to the conversion and repayment of some of the outstanding short-term notes into equity and an interest accrual of $52,173.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The prior year amortization of debt discount and finance costs consisted primarily of the amortization of debt discount raised on convertible notes of $311,152 and the accelerated amortization of debt discount amounting to $867,343 on notes payable which were converted into common stock during the prior year and an interest accrual of $176,099 on long-term and short-term notes.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The debt discount is amortized over the term of the convertible notes, which ranges from a few months to five years, any conversion of these notes or redemption of these notes results in an immediate amortization of the remaining debt discount associated with the note concerned.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The decrease in interest accrual is primarily due to the conversion and repayment of substantially all of the interest bearing long and short term notes during the last quarter of the prior year and the first two quarters of the current year.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The change in fair value of derivative liabilities was $449,411 and $237,799 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively, an increase of $211,612 or 89.0%.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The current year includes a charge of $668,756 representing the mark-to-market of equities issued to short-term convertible note holders who converted their debt into equity at deeply discounted prices based on variable pricing options, offset by a mark-to-market credit of $242,404 on short-term convertible notes prior to conversion to equity and the creation of a derivative liability of $23,060 on short term debt issued during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The prior year change in derivatives was due to creation and revaluation of derivative liabilities on short-term convertible debt issued.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We incurred a net loss of $5,018,483 and $3,816,851 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, an increase of $1,201,632 or 31.5%, respectively and which consists of the various revenue and expense items discussed above.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	A deemed preferred stock dividend of $1,604,335 has been disclosed in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	This amount represents the in-the-money value of the conversion feature of the newly issued Series B Preferred Stock as of the date of issue.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	These Shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	The valuation of this beneficial conversion feature was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	We raised gross proceeds of $5,000,000 from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock in February 2015, $750,000 from our sale of our Series B Preferred Stock in March 2014 and $1,103,000 from the sale of our common stock and warrants in June and August of 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised proceeds of $340,000 from the sale of our debt securities, none of which remain outstanding on the date hereof.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $10,412,155 through December 31, 2014 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $1,360,826 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our primary financial commitments on the date hereof are payments owed under the License Agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The minimum commitments due under the license agreement for the next five years are summarized as follows:
1434110_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2014 we had notes, in the principal amount outstanding of $310,250.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Subsequent to year end until March 30, 2015, we had converted notes in the principal amount of $11,250 into equity and had repaid notes in the principal amount of $296,000 out of the proceeds of $5,000,000 received on the issuance of Series C Preferred stock, fully disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements below.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Notes payable consisted of the following as of December 31, 2014 and March 30, 2015:
1434110_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Subsequent to year end the following notes were converted into common shares or repaid:
1434110_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this Management Discussion Analysis, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The recorded derivative liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were noted as subject to level III fair value measurements.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Accounting policies and estimates, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1434110_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (formerly known as Propell Corporation) (the Company ), is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (doing business as Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (doing business as Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,897 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,722 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved and the operations of CMI were discontinued.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S4	On February 4, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S5	( Novas ) whereby the Company exchanged 100,000,000 shares of its common stock for 100,000,000 shares of common stock in Novas.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S6	After the consummation of the share exchange, Novas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S7	As a result of the share exchange the shareholders of Novas obtained the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P3_S8	As such, the exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of the Company and Novas was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Novas, is an innovative technology and services company whose aim is to radically improve oil production by introducing modern and innovative technologies.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Novas has a unique and patent pending, Plasma-Pulse Treatment ( PPT ) technology, which is a new Enhanced Oil Recovery methodology and process that has been developed to be environmentally friendly, mobile, time efficient and extremely cost effective.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	PPT has the potential to drive new and renewed revenue for energy producers and become a new standard for the entire petroleum industry.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1434110_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	All amounts referred to in the notes to the financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary in which it has a majority voting interest.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
1434110_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P8_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.

1434110_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.

1434110_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.

1434110_15_ITEM8_P17_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company s operations are carried out in the USA and Mexico.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the USA and Mexico and by the general state of those economies.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	The update gives entities a single comprehensive model to use in reporting information about the amount and timing of revenue resulting from contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	The proposed ASU, which would apply to any entity that enters into contracts to provide goods or services, would supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	Additionally, the update would supersede some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S4	The update removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S5	In addition, the update improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S6	The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P21_S7	This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation .
1434110_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	The update removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	In addition, the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to the company s current activities.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	Furthermore, the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity which may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P22_S4	The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	We have elected to adopt the provisions of this ASU early, accordingly all of the past disclosures and presentations on development stage accounting have been eliminated.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period .
1434110_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period.
1434110_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.

1434110_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1434110_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.

1434110_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

1434110_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	WHEREAS, Director is a director of Propell.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Propell considers Director s continued services by Propell to be important to its growth, and consequently Propell wishes to grant to Director, shares of Propell restricted common stock, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	The parties therefore agree as follows:
1434110_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Propell hereby issues to Director [_________] shares of Propell common stock, subject to vesting as provided in section 2 (those shares and any securities issued in respect of or as replacements for those shares, the Shares ).
1434110_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	On each of the first three anniversaries of the date of this Agreement, 33 1/3% of the Shares will vest (any Shares that vest, Vested Shares any Shares remaining unvested, Restricted Shares ).
1434110_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	If shares of Propell common stock are subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares, or Propell pays any stock dividend or otherwise issues any securities in respect of Propell common stock, or upon a merger, consolidation, reorganization, split-up, combination, or recapitalization or the like of Propell, or upon exchange of shares of Propell common stock or other securities issued in respect of Propell common stock for other securities of Propell or of another corporation, all references under this Agreement to the Shares, Vested Shares, or Restricted Shares will be appropriately adjusted or revised to reflect that change.

1434110_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	(b) Subject to restrictions on transferability of the Shares stated elsewhere in this Agreement, Director shall not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any Shares or any beneficial interest therein unless (1) the Shares or beneficial interest, as the case may be, that he proposes to dispose of are registered in an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or (2) if required by Propell, Propell has received an opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to Propell, from Propell s legal counsel to the effect that disposition of those Shares or that beneficial interest, as the case may be, does not require registration under the Securities Act, or any applicable state securities laws.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	(c) Director acknowledges that neither Propell nor any agent of Propell is required to recognize any transfer of any Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for Propell, that transfer would result in violation by Propell of any federal or state law with respect to the offering, issuance, or sale of securities.

1434110_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Nothing contained in this Agreement confers on Director any right with respect to continuation of his directorship by Propell or interferes in any way with the right of Propell at any time to terminate Director s directorship or otherwise modify the terms of Director s directorship by Propell, subject to the terms of any directorship or other agreement, any provision of law, or Propell s organizational documents, to the contrary.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	(a) Director understands that under section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), as of the date that any forfeiture restrictions applicable to any Restricted Shares lapse, the excess of the fair market value of those Restricted Shares on that date over the purchase price paid for those Restricted Shares will be reportable as ordinary income.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Director understands, however, that he may elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Shares are acquired under this Agreement, rather than when the Restricted Shares cease to be subject to the forfeiture restrictions of this Agreement, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the date of this Agreement.
1434110_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	(b) Director acknowledges that it is his/her/its sole responsibility, and not Propell s, to file a timely election under section 83(b), even if Director requests that Propell or its representatives make this filing on Director s behalf.

1434110_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Propell Technologies Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, John Huemoeller, II, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to Section 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1434110_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Propell Technologies, Inc. intends to be an oil exploration and production ( E P ) acquisition company with the intention to build and grow a base of producing assets by leveraging M A and operational expertise, and by using advanced technology including Plasma Pulse well treatment which uses no acidization, hydrofracking or other chemicals.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Novas Energy USA, Inc., and now through its indirect majority owned subsidiary, Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ), the intention is to improve oil production using (the Plasma Pulse Technology ).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Novas has an exclusive, perpetual license to engage significantly in the commercial application of a unique proprietary Plasma-Pulse Treatment (the Plasma Pulse Technology ) technology in the United States and Mexico, which it licenses from Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) and sublicenses on an exclusive basis to its majority owned subsidiary, NENA, for use in the United States and Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology is an Enhanced Oil Recovery methodology and process that has been developed to be environmentally friendly, mobile, time efficient and cost effective.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is patented in the USA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	We expect the Plasma Pulse Technology to continue to drive new and renewed revenue for energy producers and we believe it has the potential to become a new standard for the entire petroleum industry.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Since February 4, 2013, following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, our primary focus has shifted to the further development of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	The oil recovery technology used by Novas is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license (the License Agreement ) to engage in the commercial application of the Plasma Pulse Technology entered into on January 30, 2013, as amended in March 2014 and December 23, 2014 with Novas Energy Group Limited ( Licensor ) which granted Novas the right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico to enhance oil production.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	The license agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	On October 22, 2015, Novas entered into an operating agreement with Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. ( Technovita ) (the Joint Venture Agreement ) through a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, NENA, whereby Novas agreed to contribute $1,200,000 ($600,000 to be delivered on the effective date (October 22, 2015) of the Joint Venture Agreement, $300,000 on November 1, 2015 and $300,000 on the two month anniversary of the Effective Date) to the capital of NENA for 60% of the membership interests of NENA and Technovita agreed to contribute an aggregate of $800,000 to the capital of NENA for 40% of the membership interests of NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	In terms of a side agreement entered into on November 18, 2015, the revenue and expenses incurred by Technovita prior to entering into the operating agreement have been included in the joint venture and consolidated into the Company s results effective September 1, 2015.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	In October 2015, Novas entered into a sublicense agreement (the Novas Sublicense Agreement ) with NENA and the Licensor pursuant to which NENA was granted the right, subject to certain exceptions to be the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of Sublicense Agreements (the Technovita Sublicense Agreement ) that was entered into between Technovita, NENA and Licensor, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Both Novas and Technovita will retain the right to deploy the Plasma Pulse Technology on vertical wells owned by Novas or Technovita in the United States or Canada, respectively.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Although relatively new to the United States and Mexico, the Plasma Pulse Technology has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology is patented in the USA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Since March 19, 2013, Novas has used the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty oil and injector wells located in eight states; Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, California, Tennessee, Colorado and Wyoming.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology has been shown to increase oil production or injection rates in many of the wells that we have treated.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	The initial results of this treatment have been very encouraging, however the results on the wells treated may not be indicative of the results of treatment on additional wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	We currently have six tools that we use to perform the treatments in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch and 4 casings, but not in horizontal wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Initially we offered our services to independent oil wells based on a joint venture model in which we received a percentage of the revenue that our customers derived from additional production resulting from the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology, we have not concluded any further agreements under this joint venture model.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	We also offered our services on a fee-based model and charged a service fee for use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	In 2014 we treated sixteen wells for service fees.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the Novas Sublicense Agreement, we transferred our exclusive right to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat vertical wells in the United States to NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	As such, NENA now has the exclusive right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P8_S5	We retained, however, the right to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat wells that we acquire in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	In addition, it is our intention to acquire producing oil fields to generate revenues and we may use the Plasma Pulse Technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	To date, we derived $349,194 in revenue from our oil enhancement business, no revenue has been recognized from the joint venture arrangement.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $14,393,474 through December 31, 2015 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	On October 22, 2015, Novas entered into an operating agreement with Technovita through a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, NENA, whereby Novas agreed to contribute $1,200,000 ($600,000 to be delivered on the effective date (October 22, 2015) of the Joint Venture Agreement, $300,000 on November 1, 2015 and $300,000 on the two month anniversary of the Effective Date) to the capital of NENA for 60% of the membership interests of NENA and Technovita agreed to contribute an aggregate of $800,000 to the capital of NENA for 40% of the membership interests of NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	In terms of a side agreement entered into on November 18, 2015, the revenue and expenses incurred by Technovita prior to entering into the operating agreement have been included in the joint venture and consolidated into the Company s results effective September 1, 2015.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	To date we have contributed $900,000 to the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of a Novas Sublicense Agreement that was entered into between Novas, NENA and the Licensor, NENA will be the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology to third parties in the United States for the vertical treatment of wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of the Technovita Sublicense Agreement that was entered into between Technovita, NENA and Licensor, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology to third parties in Canada for the vertical treatment of wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, both Novas and Technovita have the right to deploy the Plasma Pulse Technology on wells owned by Novas or Technovita in the United States or Canada, respectively.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	If either Novas or Technovita terminates the Sublicense Agreement with NENA and Licensor, the non- terminating party will receive 100% of the terminating member s membership interest in NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The business and affairs of NENA are to be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, consisting of five (5) members, three (3) of whom to be appointed by Novas and two (2) of whom to be appointed by Technovita.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Currently, the Board consists of four members, of which two of whom have been appointed by Novas.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	Novas retains the right to appoint an additional Board member.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Board approval is required to: (i) incur any indebtedness, pledge or grant liens on any assets or guarantee, assume, endorse or otherwise become responsible for the obligations of any other person, except to the extent approved or authorized in NENA s budget; (ii) make any loan, advance or capital contribution in any person, except to the extent approved or authorized in the budget; (iii) transfer any equipment necessary in the deployment of the Vertical Technology to any third party; (iv) enter into or effect any transaction or series of related transactions involving the sale of NENA or the sale, lease, license, exchange or other disposition (including by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or similar business transaction) by NENA of any assets in excess of $300,000; (v) appoint or remove NENA s auditors or make any changes in the accounting methods or policies of NENA (other than as required by GAAP); (vi) enter into or effect any transaction or series of related transactions involving the purchase, lease, license, exchange or other acquisition (including by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or acquisition of assets) by NENA of any assets and/or equity interests of any person and/ or assets in excess of $300,000; or (v) enter into or effect any commercial transaction or series of related commercial transactions involving anticipated liabilities or revenues of NENA in excess of $500,000 or that materially vary from NENA s existing strategy or business plan.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Joint Venture has provided NENA with access to Technovita s experienced team, the ability to build one North American brand, the ability to leverage the strength of the combined entity expanding our geographic reach beyond the United States and into Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	To date NENA has treated a total of fourteen wells, two in the USA, one in Colorado and one in Kansas and twelve in Alberta, Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	No revenue has been recognized as yet for these treatments.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	On January 1, 2016, we entered into a three-year employment agreement with C. Brian Boutte (the Boutte Employment Agreement ) to serve as our Chief Executive Officer.

1434110_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that the following are key attributes of our company:
1434110_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The ability to acquire conventional assets with existing production and upside in known hydrocarbon plays, and enhance production with selective applications of Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our licensed technology does not use any chemicals or water.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Propell Technologies Group, Inc. (f/k/a Propell Corporation) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P35_S4	In September 2010, CMI s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated and effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our interest in CMI for nominal consideration.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	On July 6, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 5,000,000 preferred shares as Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	On August 17, 2012, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, which increased the number of shares of our authorized Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares, effectuated a 50:1 reverse split of the number of shares of our outstanding common stock and changed our name to Propell Technologies Group, Inc.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	On February 4, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Novas and Novas became our wholly owned subsidiary.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	Effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	On March 14, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 500,000 preferred shares as Series B Preferred Stock.

1434110_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our fiscal year end is December 31.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into the exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing License Agreement with the Licensor, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014, that granted Novas the right to practice, develop, use, market and commercialize the proprietary process of the Licensor, which consists of a specially designed apparatus and certain proprietary technology, methods and processes that may be applied to enhance the production of hydrocarbon deposits using metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band and elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The amended License Agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	The amended License Agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The process has been successfully utilized outside of the United States and Mexico for several years.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Most of our tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	We developed U.S. made tools to treat 4 -inch cased wells and have recently begun using the tools.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	To date, we have used the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the United States in eight states; Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California, Tennessee, Colorado and Texas, and twelve wells in Alberta, Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Many of the wells experienced an increase in oil production or injection rates after being treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Due to the fact that several wells we have treated had no prior operating history, operators that pay for the service are not required to deliver data and others have required that we maintain the confidentiality of the results of our treatments, we are unable to disclose the percent increase in oil production resulting from use of our technology for all wells that we have treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	On September 18, 2014, Novas entered into an exclusive limited use agreement with Pozotech Inc. ( Pozotech ), which was amended on December 23, 2014, for the exclusive right to the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Pozotech has established relationships with certain companies in the oil industry in Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	The terms of the use agreement allow Pozotech to retain a commission per well for each well treated with the Plasma Pulse Technology due to an introduction made by Pozotech and Pozotech pays Novas a flat fee of $25,000 per well treated upon its receipt of payment.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Novas has the right to terminate the agreement upon three months prior written notice and if so terminated Pozotech may continue to use the Plasma Pulse Technology to perform its obligations under third party contracts then in effect but may not enter into new contracts with respect to the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States in Russia and China.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The success of our application of our enhanced oil technology largely depends upon the selection of candidate wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The ideal candidate well requirements are as follows:
1434110_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	the reservoir pressure is greater than the saturation pressure.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Additionally, when selecting a target well or oil field NENA analyze the various soil formations such as limestone, sandstone, tight sand, dolomite, shale or clay.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	NENA also analyzes well logs and the reservoir drive system (water, gas, gravity) and water cuts.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Depending upon the analysis of a candidate well a unique treatment plan is developed which includes the frequency, timing and magnitude of the plasma pulses.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) 2014, the United States produced an estimated 3.2 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate in 2014 (over 8.7 million barrels/day), an increase of about 17% from 2013.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	This level represents the country's sixth consecutive annual production increase.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Production from the Lower 48 states was 19% above the 2013 level.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	Alaska experienced a 2% production decline.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	According to U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves, 2014, released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil proved reserves increased in 2014 for the sixth year in a row exceeding 39 billion barrels for the first time since 1972 with a net addition of 3.4 billion barrels of proved oil reserves (a 9% increase).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	U.S. natural gas proved reserves increased 10% in 2014, raising the U.S. total to a record 388.8 trillion cubic feet.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Texas added 2.1 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves (the largest increase of any state in 2014), mostly located within the Texas portion of the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale play.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	North Dakota added 0.4 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves (the second-largest increase in 2014) mostly from the Bakken Shale play.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The vast majority of US production increases and reserve additions is due to hydraulic fracturing of unconventional resources (tight sands and shales).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is the fracturing of various rock layers by a pressurized liquid.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	Some hydraulic fractures form naturally certain veins or dikes are examples and can create conduits along which gas and petroleum from source rocks may migrate to reservoir rocks.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Induced hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, is a technique in which usually a large amount of water is mixed with sand and/or chemicals (a different technique where only chemicals are used is referred to as acidizing).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	This mixture is injected at high pressure into faults to release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas, and coal seam gas), or other substances for extraction.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	This type of fracturing creates fractures from a wellbore drilled into reservoir rock formations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Of the approximately 45,000 total wells drilled in the United States during 2012 we estimated that 31,500 or 70.0% were oil wells and the remainder gas wells that are not part of our target market.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Of the 31,500 oil wells drilled approximately 15,750 or 50% were vertical wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We believe that the size of the market will continue to grow for our technology as we already have the ability to treat certain existing wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	However due to the recent drop in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December 2014 to $45 per barrel on March 20, 2015, the number of drilling rigs have fallen by 734 from 1,803 on March 20, 2014 to 1,069 on March 20, 2015 (Baker Hughes Rig Counts).
1434110_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	Therefore, the number of new wells that were drilled in 2015 were considerably less than the last few years.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	On a go forward basis, we intend to acquire and grow a base of conventional producing assets by leveraging M A and operational expertise, and by using Plasma Pulse well treatment, coupled with the expectation of a corresponding development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves once oil supply/ demand rebalances and prices rebound to produce revenue; however, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating costs.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Since entering into the Sublicense Agreement with NENA, we no longer directly perform well treatment services and instead such services are performed by NENA in the USA and through the Technovita Sublicense Agreement, NENA has the exclusive right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology in Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	The joint venture provides us with access to Technovita s experienced team, the ability to build one North American brand, the ability to leverage the strength of the combined entity expanding our geographic reach beyond the United States and into Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	To date, we have not derived any revenue form the operations of NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Plasma Pulse Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide related services to third parties in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	The license is limited to the United States and Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S4	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S5	Under certain circumstances, we have the right to make additional cash payments to cover certain royalty payment deficiencies.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S6	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S7	Royalties based on revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S8	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid with respect to one of the two territories, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to that particular territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P62_S9	Subsequent to year end, the additional $200,000 due to the Licensor on June 30, 2015 was waived.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	If the Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the Plasma Pulse Technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	To date, we have presented our technology at several conferences focused on worldwide energy concerns.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	See Thru Investor Convention and the Total Energy USA Conference.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Typically oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S4	Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P66_S5	Further, on May 4, 2012, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (e.g., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S4	We are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P67_S5	Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	In addition, Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state's Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	(b) OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	The term waters of the United States has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Competition in the oil industry is intense.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	We also actively compete against other oil companies with substantial financial and other resources.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves a high degree of risk.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our Company.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently focused on a new line of business and a new business strategy and have very limited operating history and limited information.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have recently engaged in a new business line involving our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have also recently switched our business model with our entry into a Joint Venture Agreement with Technovita.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	There is a risk that the joint venture will be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with Technovita s management and structure.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The joint venture estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The joint venture management has limited direct experience in this new line of business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	The joint venture is subject to the risks such as their ability to implement their business plan, market acceptance of the proposed business and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of their ability to generate revenues.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	There is no assurance that the joint venture activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of their success must be considered in light of the stage of development.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	To date, we have not derived any revenue from the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Even if the joint venture generates revenue, there can be no assurance that it will be profitable.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	In addition, no assurance can be given that the joint venture will be able to consummate its business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force the joint venture to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The joint venture has insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends or even to make quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating results.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	You should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We currently have limited revenues from our Plasma Pulse Technology and may not generate any revenue in the near future, if at all, from the use of our technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We currently have generated limited revenues from the use of our Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	To date, we have not derived any revenue from the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The majority of the wells that were treated were treated as sample wells to demonstrate the ability of the Plasma Pulse Technology at no cost to the well owner.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, there can be no assurance that well owners will determine that the price to be paid by the joint venture customers for their services, whether in the form of a cash payment or profit sharing arrangement, will be deemed to be reasonable and that customers will be willing to pay such prices.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we had net revenues of $91,000 and $190,035, respectively, from our oil recovery business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sustained a net loss of $4,331,980 and $5,018,483, respectively.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	To date, we have not generated significant revenue from the Plasma Pulse Technology and NENA has not generated any revenue from the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business and our recent changes in business strategy.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our future plans and operations may require that we raise additional capital.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014 we raised a total of $14,750,000 from our private placement of Series C Preferred stock to Ervington consummated during February and June 2015 and $1,103,000 during the period June to August of 2014 and an additional $750,000 from the sale of our Series B Preferred Stock in March 2014.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes and intend to acquire an oil well with the funds that were recently raised.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goals with the cash on hand or the cash generated from operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The joint venture may not be able to service customers with the six tools that we currently have.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The joint ventures ability to continue to service customers and expand its business is dependent upon it acquiring additional apparatuses to be utilized with the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We currently have six down-hole tools that can treat 5 inch cased wells and one new tool that treats 4 -inch cased wells and horizontal wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If the tools should require repair the joint venture may be unable to service customers.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, with only nine tools, the joint venture can only treat a limited number of wells at a time and are unable to treat wells on days when the tools are in transit from one customer s well to another well.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, only one of the tools can treat the 4 -inch cased wells and horizontal wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There is no guarantee that the planned joint venture will be successful .
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	To date, Technovita has treated very limited wells with the Plasma Pulse Technology and therefore there is no guarantee that the Technovita team will be successful in meeting its milestones.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Due to limited data about well treatment it is difficult to assess the revenue to be derived from the Canadian wells, which may not perform as expected and may contribute less than 40% to the revenue of the planned joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We will only have a 60% interest in revenue derived from treatment of U.S. wells instead of our current 100% interest.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Although Novas has the right to terminate the joint venture if certain milestones are not met, if the milestones are met there can be no assurance that the revenue derived from U.S. wells will not exceed 60% of the revenue of the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We did not receive a valuation or fairness opinion regarding the joint venture and Novas percent ownership in the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	To date, we have contributed $900,000 to the joint venture and are required to contribute and additional $300.000 to the joint venture that may not be recovered in the event that the joint venture dissolves.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, the joint venture will bear the additional costs associated with the additional Technovita management team.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of the Plasma Pulse Technology and products.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Plasma Pulse Technology that we license has been utilized in the United States on a limited basis.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	NENA has not yet generated any revenue from the Plasma Pulse Technology and prior to sublicensing the Plasma Pulse Technology to NENA, we had not generated significant revenue from the Plasma Pulse Technology and there can be no assurance that the Plasma Pulse Technology will be accepted in the market or that NENA s commercialization efforts will be successful.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The results of the application of our technology for initial well treatments may not support future well treatments and are not necessarily predictive of future long-term results on the wells for which the initial data is favorable.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To date, we have applied the licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the USA and an additional twelve wells in Canada, and we do not have long terms results on the wells that were treated.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Of such wells, we have seen improvement results in many wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Favorable results in our early treatments may not last and may not be repeated in later treatments of other wells.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Success in early treatments does not ensure that wells treated at a later date will be successful.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Additionally, collecting treatment data results is not always possible as operators that pay for the service are not required to deliver data or we are required to work under non-disclosure agreements.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on a license to use the Plasma Pulse Technology that is material to our business and if the agreement were to be terminated, it would halt our ability to market our technology, as well as have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have a License Agreement with the Licensor granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property, which we have sub-licensed to NENA.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we or NENA breach the terms of this agreement, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we or NENA were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability or that of NENA to market the Plasma Pulse Technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum royalties under our license agreement.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The License Agreement with the Licensor requires us to pay aggregate minimum royalty payments of $1,000,000 per year; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to (i) December 31, 2015 with respect to Mexican operations and (ii) the three-year anniversary of the license agreement with respect to the United States operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement with respect to a certain territory under certain circumstances and in certain other circumstances has the right to terminate the entire agreement.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Subsequent to year end, the $200,000 due with respect to our license to operate in Mexico was waived.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	To date, we have not generated enough revenue to pay minimum royalty payments.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	No assurance can be given that the joint venture or we will generate sufficient revenue to make these minimum royalty payments.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any failure to make the payments would permit the Licensor to terminate the license.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability to market our technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives Ervington effective control of us, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Ervington currently beneficially owns approximately 50.9% of our voting shares on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments).
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, Ervington currently has the right to three votes on our board of directors and has appointed two members with an aggregate of three votes, which constitutes a majority of the votes on our board of directors.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As a result of these appointment rights and its voting control of our company, Ervington has the power to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors, our business strategy, our day-to-day operations and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Ervington s control of our company could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, preventing a change in control of our company that might be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders, and possibly depress the trading price of our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to Ervington s ownership and control of our company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Demand for the services and products of the joint venture or oil derived from wells we acquire is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The recent decline in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December 2014 to $40 per barrel in December 2015 has resulted in a decline in oil drilling which has depressed the immediate level of exploration, development, and production activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	State and local governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of oil recovery efforts on the environment.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our business and we can offer no assurances they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations and possibly our operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations and would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in several states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that include protections for proprietary information.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process if applicable to competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements for wells we acquire and treat and the joint venture will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements for wells it treats.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Strict liability means that in some situations we or the joint venture could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our or the joint ventures conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Existing or future laws, regulations, related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for the services of the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns).
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that the joint venture uses in its services and products.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and that of the joint venture.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us on wells that we acquire may not be productive.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may acquire properties upon which we believe recompletion activity will be successful.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The costs of recompleting, and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following unexpected drilling conditions:
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Certain of our future activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We intend to become an exploitation and production stage company .
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock to acquire oil fields and intend to become an exploitation and production stage company which will face a high risk of business failure because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas exploitation ventures.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Potential investors should be aware of the risks and uncertainties normally encountered by oil and gas companies and the high rate of failure of such companies.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that could be encountered in connection with our planned exploitation and followed drilling.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	These potential problems include, but are not limited to, possible problems relating to exploitation and additional costs and expenses that may reduce our current forecast of income and asset value.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Additional expenditures related to exploitation may not result in the confirmation of anticipated oil and gas reserves.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral development and often result in unsuccessful efforts.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The acquisition of additional fields will be dependent upon us possessing capital resources at that time in order to purchase and/or maintain such concessions.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If no funding is available, we may be forced to cease our exploitation activities.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our anticipated future oil drilling and producing operations will involve various risks.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Once we acquire wells and commence oil exploitation activities, we will be subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including:
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We intend to maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, insurance will not protect us against all risks.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Uncertainty of economic conditions, worldwide and in the United States may have a significant negative effect on operating results, liquidity and financial condition .
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Effects of change in domestic and international economic conditions could include a decline in demand for oil and natural gas resulting in decreased oil, and natural gas reserves due to curtailed drilling activity; A decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production, and either a production decline, or a decrease in oil, and natural gas prices, would have a negative impact on our cash flow, profitability and value.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There is competition in the oil and gas industry for acquisition of oil wells and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is extremely intense in all aspects, including but not limited to raising investment capital and obtaining qualified managerial and technical employees.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We are an insignificant participant in the oil and gas industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our competition includes large established oil and gas companies, with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than we have, as well as the myriad of other small stage companies.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	These companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define, evaluate, bid for, purchase and subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	As a result of this competition, we may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P53_S5	If we are unable to successfully compete for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed, suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Shortages of oil field equipment, services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, resulting in periodic shortages.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	When demand for rigs and equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	These shortages or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of the Company s wells, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flow and operating results.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our operations will be subject to permitting requirements.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Oil drilling operations will be subject to permitting requirements, which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our operations, including but not limited to any exploitation program, require permits from the U.S. government.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration and/or exploitation, may be materially and adversely affected.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our amended license agreement grants us a license, which has been sub-licensed to NENA, to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico and the joint venture is anticipated to conduct business in Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm the future international expansion and operations of the joint venture and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We will have limited control over the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we do not operate.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may acquire interests in oil wells that will be operated by other companies.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We will have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The loss of any key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We face intense competition for qualified individuals.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S4	We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to implement our business plan.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The market in the oil and gas recovery industry is highly competitive.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We face competition from owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies The ability of the joint venture to compete effectively depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our technology and the joint ventures ability to service its customers in a timely manner.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	There can be no assurance that the joint venture will be able to compete effectively or that it will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Most of the potential customers of the joint venture are owners of oil wells and are subject to risks faced by those industries.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We expect the joint venture to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the implementation of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	As a result, it will be subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the oil industry, such as availability of capital, weather and environmental issues, government regulation, and the uncertainty resulting from technological change.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have no separate independent audit committee.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of four directors, none of whom are considered to be independent.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	This may hinder our Board of Directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of four directors, one of whom has two votes and none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our Board of Directors, which does not have a majority of independent directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers that are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Trading on the OTCQB may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There may be future dilution of our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Holders of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares into 31,375,000 shares of common stock and; the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to convert his shares into 4,000,000 common shares and Ervington, the sole holder of the Series C Preferred Stock has the right to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 120,000,000 shares of common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We also have warrants outstanding that are convertible into 6,339,498 shares of our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S2	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow the accounting standards on share based payments.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S4	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P84_S5	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTCQB.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P87_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Our management discovered insufficient controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions and a lack of segregation of duties.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Our Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 4% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $3.277777778 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S3	In addition, our Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $10.00 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Other than dividend payments on the preferred stock we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.
1434110_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are engaged in the commercial application of a proprietary Plasma Pulse Technology to enhance the recovery of oil in the United States and Mexico.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We began introducing the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States through Novas on a limited basis in March 2013.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Prior to this, all of our revenue had been derived from our e-commerce and other lines of business, which we discontinued, effective December 31, 2013, to enable us to focus all of our attention to our oil recovery business.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since February 4, 2013, our primary focus has been to the further development of our licensed oil recovery technology.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Plasma Pulse Technology used by Novas, which has been sublicensed to NENA for use in the United States, is based on an exclusive, perpetual royalty-bearing license to engage in the commercial application of the proprietary Plasma Pulse Technology entered into on January 30, 2013, as amended in March 2014 and December 23, 2014 with the Licensor which granted Novas the right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico to enhance oil production.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	The License Agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	During 2014, we offered our services to independent oil wells based on a joint venture model in which we received a percentage of the revenue that our customers derived from additional production resulting from the use of the Plasma Pulse Technology, we have not concluded any further agreements under this joint venture model.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We also offered our services on a fee based model and charged a service fee for use of the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	In 2014 we treated sixteen wells for service fees.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the Novas Sublicense Agreement, we no longer have the right to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat vertical wells in the United States and instead NENA now has the exclusive right to use the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	We do have the right to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to treat wells that we acquire in the United States.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	It is our intention to acquire oil fields to generate revenues and to use the Plasma Pulse Technology on our acquired wells to increase their production.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	To date, we derived $349,194 in revenue from our oil enhancement business, no revenue has been recognized from the joint venture arrangement.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $14,393,474 through December 31, 2015 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of the Novas Sublicense Agreement, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology to third parties in the United States for the treatment of vertical wells.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of Technovita Sublicense Agreement, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Vertical Technology to third parties in Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, both Novas and Technovita retained the right to deploy the Vertical Technology on wells owned by Novas or Technovita in the United States or Canada, respectively.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	If either Novas or Technovita terminates the Sublicense Agreement with NENA and Licensor, the non- terminating party will receive 100% of the terminating member s membership interest in NENA.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Revenue has been sporadic as the business is being developed and comparison to prior periods during this development stage has limited value in aiding a business analysis.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	There has been no recognizable revenue produced by the joint venture for the current year, primarily due to the current market conditions faced by the oil and gas industry, with market prices of hydrocarbon products currently at multi-year low points.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	In the prior year the derivative liability movement reflected a mark-to-market of equities issued to short-term note holders who converted their debt to equity at deeply discounted prices based on variable priced conversion rates which was offset by a mark-to-market credits on the remaining short-term convertible notes and a new derivative liabilities raised on short term debt issued in the prior year.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	We raised gross proceeds of $14,750,000 from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock in February 2015 and June 2015.

1434110_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $14,393,474 through December 31, 2015 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $2,956,543 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our primary commitments include the minimum commitments under the license agreements and our commitment to invest a further $300,000 in NENA, over and above the $900,000 invested in NENA as of December 31, 2015, based on their cash flow needs.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our primary financial commitments on the date hereof are payments owed under the License Agreement.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The minimum commitments due under the license agreement for the next five years are summarized as follows :
1434110_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this Management Discussion Analysis, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The recorded derivative liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2015 were noted as subject to level III fair value measurements.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Accounting policies and estimates, in the Notes to Financial Statements.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P7_S5	( Novas ) whereby the Company exchanged 100,000,000 shares of its common stock for 100,000,000 shares of common stock in Novas.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P7_S6	After the consummation of the share exchange, Novas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P7_S7	As a result of the share exchange the shareholders of Novas obtained the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P7_S8	As such, the exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of the Company and Novas was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Novas, and majority owned subsidiary, NENA, is an innovative technology and services company whose aim is to improve oil production by introducing modern and innovative technologies.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
1434110_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company s operations are carried out in the USA, Mexico and Canada.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the USA, Mexico and Canada and by the general state of those economies.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.

1434110_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1434110_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

1434110_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Brian Boutte, Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to Section 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1434110_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology ( PPT )) has not been found.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible sale of our technology and PPT assets, forming a special committee to investigate a possible share buyback of the majority shareholder, Ervington Investments, and/or a possible dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	In July 2015, when we closed the final tranche of our private placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, we shifted our operational focus from being a direct provider of well services based upon PPT to actively seeking to acquire producing oil fields to generate revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves .
1434110_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	As a result, in August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved through the formation of a joint venture, the exclusive sublicense to our majority owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ) of our rights to use certain plasma pulse technology that we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the Licensor ) pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement (the License Agreement ), for treatment of vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology ).
1434110_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	We retained the right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of our own assets located in the United States as well as treatment of assets outside of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology refers to the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse technology as covered by Licensor s patent rights.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Although we were indirectly engaged in the oil recovery business through NENA and directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico, it was not our foundational business strategy.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	In October 2016, we terminated the joint venture due to its failure to meet certain milestones, including its generation of minimal revenue.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	We intend to terminate our agreement with our Mexican partner in the near future.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,512,441 through December 31, 2016 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. ( Novas USA ), our wholly owned subsidiary, delivered a notice to its joint venture partner, Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. ( Technovita ) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the Joint Venture ), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ), dated October 22, 2015 (the Operating Agreement ), by and among Novas USA and Technovita.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement provides that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails to satisfy any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the Year 1 Milestone ).
1434110_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the Year 1 Key Performance Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015 each of: (1) sales from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and (4) EBITDA from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	In fact, NENA has not generated more than nominal revenue.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets of the Joint Venture, including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to Technovita solely for use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and its territories.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, Novas USA had entered into a sublicense agreement (the Novas Sublicense Agreement ) with NENA and Novas Energy Group Limited for NENA to be the exclusive provider of Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Sublicense Agreement was terminated upon termination of the Joint Venture.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Operating Agreement also provided, among other things, that Novas USA would contribute an aggregate of $1,200,000 to the capital of the Joint Venture for its 60% interest in the Joint Venture.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	Novas USA has contributed $900,000 to the Joint Venture to date and believes that it has valid defenses to any claim that may be made that it contribute additional funds.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from the Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Novas has recently been contacted by the Licensor with a request for settlement discussions; however there can be no assurance that such discussions will occur or what the outcome of any such discussions will be.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and further intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and we believe that such failures on Licensor s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, although the Licensor has not accepted our claim.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Going forward, if we decide to continue to treat oil wells, our intent is to deploy our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, however, if we were to seek to continue to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, by reason of the termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, we would be required to pay royalties to Licensor.

1434110_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	The amended License Agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma- generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Most of our tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 -inch casings and not in horizontal wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We developed U.S. made tools to treat 4 -inch cased wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States in Russia and China.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States produced an estimated 3.25 billion barrels of crude oil in 2016, a decrease of about 5% from the estimated 3.4 billion barrels produced in 2015.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Previous to 2016, annual crude oil production in the United States had increased for seven consecutive years.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	According to U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves, 2015, released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in December 2016, U.S. crude oil proved reserves decreased between year end 2014 and year end 2015 from 39.9 billion barrels to 35.2 billion barrels, an 11.8% decrease and the average price of oil dropped 47% in 2015 compared to 2014.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	U.S production of crude oil and lease condensate increased in 2015 for the seventh consecutive year by 7% from 2014.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Texas has the largest proved reserves of any state but also the largest decline, a net decrease of $1 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves from 2014 to 2015.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	North Dakota has the second largest proved reserves, mostly from the Bakken Shale, and the second largest decline in 2015, a net decrease of 838 million barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	We license the Plasma-Pulse Technology from the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Plasma Pulse Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide related services to third parties in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	The license is limited to the United States and Mexico.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S4	It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three-year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S5	Under certain circumstances, we have the right to make additional cash payments to cover certain royalty payment deficiencies.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S6	All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S7	Royalties based on revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P30_S8	If the minimum royalty is not timely paid with respect to one of the two territories, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to that territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	If the Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the Plasma Pulse Technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from the Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Novas has recently been contacted by the Licensor with a request for settlement discussions; however there can be no assurance that such discussions will occur or what the outcome of any such discussions will be.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and we believe that such failures on Licensor s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	We also believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, although the Licensor has not accepted our claim.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	Going forward, if we decide to continue to treat oil wells, our intent is to deploy our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, however, if we were to seek to continue to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, by reason of the termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, we would be required to pay royalties to Licensor.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	We have a provisional patent application pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO ) filed on August 5, 2016 and directed to our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	One of the listed co-inventors of the patent application, a former contractor (the Contractor ), currently refuses to execute a confirmatory assignment agreement confirming that he assigned all rights, title and interest to us for publically recording with the USPTO.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	While the Contractor s consulting agreement states that we own all of the intellectual property he development relating to the pulse tool, we are currently negotiating an assignment agreement with the Contractor to remove any doubt that we exclusively own the intellectual property.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	There can be no assurance that the Contractor will assign his rights to us or that additional action, such as litigation, may be required to settle the matter.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P34_S4	There can also be no assurance that the pending patent application will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	If a third party asserts a claim against us, we may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our tools, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our system.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	Additionally, we plan to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	Patent litigation can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Typically, oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The EPA has published rules that establish air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Among other things, these rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	The NESHAPS rules also include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	Compliance with the EPA s rules and requirements, especially any new green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Any such new regulations may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could further adversely impact our business and ability to market and deploy effectively the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the areas effected by such regulations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	(b) OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The term waters of the United States has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Competition in the oil industry is intense.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	We also actively compete against other oil companies with substantial financial and other resources.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves a high degree of risk.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our Company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We had intended to become an exploitation and production stage company but to date have not found any suitable oil wells to acquire, therefore we are reevaluating our business plan and strategy, making it difficult to evaluate our company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We intended to use the proceeds from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock to acquire oil fields and intend to become an exploitation and production stage company; however, to date we have not found an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the PPT).
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has suspended operations and reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible sale of our technology and PPT assets, forming a special committee to investigate a possible share buyback of the majority shareholder, Ervington Investments, and/or a possible dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Until such time as the Board determines its strategy, it will be difficult for an investor to evaluate our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we should find a suitable acquisition target and become an exploitation and production stage company, for which no decision has yet been made, we will face many risk associated therewith.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we should become an exploitation and production stage company, we will face a high risk of business failure because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas exploitation ventures.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Potential investors should be aware of the risks and uncertainties normally encountered by oil and gas companies and the high rate of failure of such companies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that could be encountered in connection with our planned exploitation and followed drilling.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These potential problems include, but are not limited to, possible problems relating to exploitation and additional costs and expenses that may reduce our current forecast of income and asset value.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Additional expenditures related to exploitation may not result in the confirmation of anticipated oil and gas reserves.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral development and often result in unsuccessful efforts.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The acquisition of additional fields will be dependent upon us possessing capital resources at that time in order to purchase and/or maintain such concessions.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If no funding is available, we may be forced to cease our exploitation activities.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	To date, we have not successfully acquired any fields and have limited funding from which to do so.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Despite our cash position, we believe we do not have sufficient capital to become an exploration and production company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our acquisition of a field is dependent upon market conditions and pricing.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The competition for the acquisition of fields is intense.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire a suitable field with our existing resources.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is difficult to evaluate because our most recent business model has been terminated and we have not formulated a new business model.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In 2015, we switched our business model with our entry into a Joint Venture Agreement with Technovita and announced that we were seeking to acquire oil wells and use a plasma pulse technology on our acquired oil wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	To date we have not acquired any wells and all of our revenue, although minimal, has been derived from operations under the Joint Venture Agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Effective November 1, 2016, we terminated the Joint Venture Agreement for its failure to meet certain specified milestones.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	To date, the joint venture has generated minimal revenue.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	With respect to any new business line that we enter into we will be subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We currently have limited revenues and may not generate any revenue in the near future, if at all, from the use of our technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have generated limited revenues from the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	During the period ended October 31, 2016, the joint venture had treated four wells using our down-hole tools.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The majority of the wells that were treated as sample wells to demonstrate the ability of plasma pulse technology at no cost to the well owner.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Effective November 1, 2016, we terminated the Joint Venture Agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Therefore, there can be no assurance that there will be any revenue from the operation of wells or from future customers of our services that utilize a plasma pulse technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had net revenues of $0 and $91,000 from our plasma pulse oil recovery business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016 we have sustained a net loss of $4,118,967 after taking into account the non-controlling shareholders share of losses and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sustained a net loss of $3,981,319 after taking into account the non-controlling shareholders share of losses and $5,018,483, respectively.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	To date, we have not acquired any oil wells, we have not generated significant revenue from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and we have generated insufficient revenue from our operations in Mexico.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to find acquisition candidates or assets that generate revenue, to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business and our recent changes in business strategy.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern .
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have incurred recurring operating losses and had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have also suspended our business operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our future plans and operations may require that we raise additional capital.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 we raised a total of $14,750,000 from our private placement of Series C Preferred stock to Ervington consummated during February and June 2015.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes and intended to acquire an oil well with the funds that were raised.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As we are currently re-evaluating our business plans, we cannot estimate how much money we will require to meet our new business plans and goals.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In evaluating various business opportunities, our limited cash will be considered and may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our new goals with the cash on hand or the cash generated from operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we acquire wells and commence oil exploitation activities, our anticipated future oil drilling and producing operations will involve various risks.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we acquire wells and commence oil exploitation activities, we will be subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including:
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We intend to maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	However, insurance will not protect us against all risks.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Uncertainty of economic conditions, worldwide and in the United States may have a significant negative effect on operating results, liquidity and financial condition .
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Effects of change in domestic and international economic conditions could include a decline in demand for oil and natural gas resulting in decreased oil, and natural gas reserves due to curtailed drilling activity; A decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production, and either a production decline, or a decrease in oil, and natural gas prices, would have a negative impact on our cash flow, profitability and value.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Due to the competition in the oil and gas industry for acquisition of oil wells and our limited financial and personnel resources we will have had and will continue to have difficulty competing for acquisition targets.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is extremely intense in all aspects, including but not limited to raising investment capital and obtaining qualified managerial and technical employees.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We are an insignificant participant in the oil and gas industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our competition includes large established oil and gas companies, with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than we have, as well as the myriad of other small stage companies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	These companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define, evaluate, bid for, purchase and subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As a result of this competition, we have not been successful in finding suitable acquisition targets and may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If we are unable to successfully compete for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed, suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If we should acquire an oil well, shortages of oil field equipment, services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, resulting in periodic shortages.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	When demand for rigs and equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we were to acquire a well, these shortages or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of our wells, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and operating results.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we should acquire an oil well, our operations will be subject to permitting requirements.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Oil drilling operations will be subject to permitting requirements, which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our operations, including but not limited to any exploitation program, require permits from the U.S. government.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration and/or exploitation, may be materially and adversely affected.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We will have limited control over the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we do not operate.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may acquire interests in oil wells that will be operated by other companies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We will have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The market in the oil and gas recovery industry is highly competitive.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We face competition from owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our technology and our ability to service customers in a timely manner.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will respond appropriately to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Although we believe the Licensor does not have the right to terminate the License Agreement, if the Licensor is successful in its claims, the result could have material adverse outcomes.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Novas has recently been contacted by Licensor with a request for settlement discussions; however, there can be no assurance that such discussions will occur or what the outcome of any such discussions will be.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and that such failures on Licensor s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Although we and Novas believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory, our termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, will impact our ability to maintain this license from and thereafter, If minimum royalties are found to be due and not otherwise waived or deferred, any failure to make the required payments would permit the Licensor to terminate the license.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Although we believe that no payment is due with respect to the territory of the United States and that other payments have been waived or excused, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with our position.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability to market the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The termination of the License Agreement or loss of the United States as a Licensed Territory could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum royalties under our license agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The License Agreement with the Licensor requires us to pay aggregate minimum royalty payments of $1,000,000 per year.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	To date, we have not generated enough revenue to pay minimum royalty payments and the Licensor has threatened to terminate the License Agreement for our failure to pay the royalty that the Licensor claims is due.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue to make these minimum royalty payments.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of the plasma pulse technology and products.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Plasma pulse technology has been utilized in the United States on a limited basis.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Neither us nor NENA were able to generate any significant revenue from the application of plasma pulse technology and there can be no assurance that any plasma pulse technology will be accepted in the market or that our commercialization efforts will be successful.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The results of the application of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for initial well treatments may not support future well treatments and are not necessarily predictive of future long-term results on the wells for which the initial data is favorable.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	To date, we have applied the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the USA and an additional twelve wells in Canada, and we do not have long term results on the wells that were treated.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Long-term results are critical insofar as favorable results that are achieved in early well treatments may not last and may not be repeated in later treatments of other wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The inability to show long-term results increases the difficulty of establishing to potential customers the economic benefit of applying the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The b eneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives Ervington effective control of us, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Ervington currently beneficially owns approximately 50.9% of our voting shares on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments).
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, Ervington currently has the right to three votes on our board of directors and has appointed one member with an aggregate of three votes, which constitutes a majority of the votes on our board of directors.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The Ervington appointee to the Board of Directors has also been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result of this appointment rights and its voting control of our company, Ervington has the power to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors, our business strategy, our day-to-day operations and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Ervington s control of our company could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, preventing a change in control of our company that might be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders, and possibly depress the trading price of our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to Ervington s ownership and control of our company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have experienced several management changes.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We have had significant changes in management in the past few years.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	On April 25, 2017, Mr. Persiyanov was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer in the place of Mr. Boutte who resigned as our Chief Executive Officer.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	On January 1, 2016, Mr. Boutte was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Changes in our key positions, as well as additions of new personnel and departures of existing personnel, can be disruptive, might lead to additional departures of existing personnel and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial results and internal controls over financial reporting.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Demand for our services and products if we continue in the oil recovery business or oil derived from any wells that we may acquire will be particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The decline in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December 2014 to $52 per barrel in December 2016 has resulted in a decline in oil drilling which has depressed the immediate level of exploration, development, and production activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations if we continue in the oil recovery line of business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	State and local governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of oil recovery efforts on the environment.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our business and we can offer no assurances they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations and possibly our operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations and would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in several states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that include protections for proprietary information.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process if applicable to competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements if we acquire any wells or treat any wells .
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In the United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Existing or future laws, regulations, related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for oil treatment services.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns).
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition if we should continue to treat wells.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In this regard, while we believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, the Licensor has not accepted our claim.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	If our claim were to be invalidated or challenged, we will not be able to deploy our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S4	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In addition, we are in dispute with the manufacturer of our plasma pulse tools over the assignment of the rights to the plasma pulse tool, we firmly believe that we own the proprietary rights to the plasma pulse tool.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us on wells that we acquire may not be productive.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may acquire properties upon which we believe recompletion activity will be successful.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The costs of recompleting, and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following unexpected drilling conditions:
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Certain of our future activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have no separate independent audit committee.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of three directors, none of whom are considered to be independent.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	This may hinder our Board of Directors effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of three directors, one of whom has three votes and none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our Board of Directors, which does not have a majority of independent directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these executive officers that are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Trading on the OTCQB may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	There currently is not an active public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Therefore, purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There may be future dilution of our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Ervington as the sole holder of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock has the right to convert its shares into 31,375,000 shares of common stock and; the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to convert his shares into 4,000,000 common shares and Ervington, the sole holder of the Series C Preferred Stock has the right to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 120,000,000 shares of common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We also have warrants outstanding that are convertible into 6,339,498 shares of our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of operations in future periods.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S2	In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow the accounting standards on share based payments.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S4	We expect that we will use stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation expense.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P84_S5	This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTCQB.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P87_S3	These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Our Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 4% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $3.277777778 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	In addition, our Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $10.00 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Other than dividend payments on the preferred stock we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In the event of such an issuance, the Preferred Stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over the then current market price per share.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S5	We currently have 3,137,500 Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding, 40,000 Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and have 4,500,000 Series C Preferred Stock outstanding.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S6	The Series C Preferred Stock has the right to annual dividends in preference to all other preferred stock and the common stock and the Series B Preferred Stock is also entitled to an annual dividend.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S7	The Series A-1, B and C Preferred Stock all have liquidation preferences over the common stock.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S8	In addition the vote of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock will be required for the (i) merger, sale of substantially all of our assets or our recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (ii) redemption or acquisition of shares of our common stock other than in limited circumstances, (iii) declaration or payment of a dividend or distribution with respect to our capital stock, (iv) making any loan or advance, (v) amending our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (vi) authorizing or creating any new class or series of equity security, (vii) increasing the number of authorized shares for issuance under any existing stock or option plan, (viii) materially changing the nature of the business, (ix) incurring any indebtedness, (x) engaging in or making investments not authorized by the Board of Directors, (xi) acquiring or divesting a material amount of assets (xii) selling, assigning, licensing, pledging or encumbering our material technology or intellectual property, and (xiii) entering into any corporate strategic relationship involving payment, contribution or assignment by us or to us of any assets.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P98_S9	The vote of two-thirds of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is also required to take certain actions similar to those set forth above.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	If we fail to meet the new eligibility requirements of the OTC Market Group, we will no longer be eligible to have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we fail to maintain a minimum bid price of $.01 per share one day per each thirty consecutive days, our stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on the OTCQB and will be traded on the pink sheets.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Effective May 1, 2014, the OTC Market Group implemented new eligibility standards for companies traded on the OTCQB that include enhanced disclosure requirements.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Due to uncertainties surrounding our liabilities and whether we are able to realize the full value of our assets, we cannot make any assurances regarding the amount available for distribution to our shareholders.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We have made certain projections relating to the amount of cash the Company expects to have to distribute to its shareholders upon dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	These projections generally relate to the amount of liabilities which must be satisfied before our company is dissolved and the amount we expect preferred stockholders to receive for their equity interest.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Each of the above projections is subject to multiple variables, including the timing of a dissolution affecting the amount of dividends payable and the amount of liabilities owed at the time of dissolution.
1434110_17_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Based upon current estimates, if we were to dissolve this quarter, it is unlikely that common shareholders will receive any such distribution.
1434110_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We entered into lease agreement for approximately 3,733 square feet of office and warehouse space in Houston, the term of the lease is for 39 months commencing on March 1, 2016 and terminating on May 31, 2019.

1434110_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We do not own any real property.
1434110_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that we have adequate space for our anticipated needs and that suitable additional space will be available at commercially reasonable prices as needed.
1434110_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no material legal proceedings that are pending or have been threatened against us of which management is aware.

1434110_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	In addition to historical information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the SEC.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	This report and other documents that we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management s assumptions.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

1434110_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Since July 2015, when we closed the final tranche of our private placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, we shifted our operational focus from being a direct provider of well services based upon plasma pulse technology to actively seeking to acquire producing oil fields to generate revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, in August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved through the formation of a joint venture, the exclusive sublicense to our majority owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ) of our rights to use certain plasma pulse technology that we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the Licensor ) pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement (the License Agreement ), for treatment of vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology ).
1434110_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	We retained the right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of our own assets located in the United States as well as treatment of assets outside of the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology refers to the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse technology as covered by Licensor s patent rights.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although we were indirectly engaged in the oil recovery business through NENA and directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico, it was not our foundational business strategy.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	In October 2016, we terminated the joint venture due to its failure to meet certain milestones.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	including its generation of minimal revenue.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	We intend to terminate our agreement with our Mexican partner in the near future.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the PPT) has not been found.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible sale of our technology and PPT assets, forming a special committee to investigate a possible share buyback of the majority shareholder, Ervington Investments, and/or a possible dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	To date, we derived $545,522 in revenue from our oil enhancement business.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,512,441 through December 31, 2016 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.

1434110_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

1434110_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Amortization of debt discount and finance costs was $(326) and $52,663 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	All debt was repaid during the first quarter of the prior period, all interest due was repaid and the remaining debt discount was fully amortized.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The change in fair value of derivative liabilities was $0 and $18,455 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively, a decrease of $18,455.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	In the prior period the derivative liability movement reflected the mark-to-market of equities issued to short-term note holders who converted their debt to equity at deeply discounted prices based on variable priced conversion rates which was offset by a mark-to-market credits on the remaining short-term convertible notes.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	We incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $2,719,242 and $3,455,328, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $736,086 or 21.3%, which consists primarily of the reduction in total expenses and the forgiveness of the license fee discussed above.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We incurred a loss from discontinued operations of $1,649,064 and $876,652 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $772,412 or 88.1%, primarily due to the joint venture only operating for four months in the prior year as opposed to ten months in the current year.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Due to the inability of the Joint Venture to meet its operating milestones, the Joint Venture is being dissolved in terms of the operating agreement.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of discontinued operations of $249,339 and $350,661 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is due to the losses in the Joint Venture being shared as to 40% by the non-controlling party until the full value of their investment of $600,000 was depleted.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The loss attributable to controlling interest of $4,118,967 and $3,981,319 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is primarily due to the reduction in total expenses, the forgiveness of the license fees due, offset by the operating losses incurred by the Joint Venture, as discussed above.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	A deemed preferred stock dividend of $0 and $2,456,781 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	This amount represents the in-the-money value of the conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock as of the date of issue.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	These shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at an exercise price of $0.12291665 per share.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	A deemed preferred stock dividend of $627,714 and $460,734 has been disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	This amount represents the dividends that are due, but remain undeclared, to Series B and Series C preferred stock holders.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We incurred a net loss of $4,746,681 and $6,898,834 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, a decrease of $2,152,153 or 31.2%, respectively and which consists of the various items discussed above.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Although the Company has cash balances of $9,170,286 as of December 31, 2016, we have a history of annual losses from operations since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company has recently suspended its operations and reduced its operating expenses as the Board of Directors are considering various options as to the future direction of the Company, including a possible dissolution.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Should the Board of Directors decide to dissolve the Company, due to uncertainties surrounding our liabilities and whether we are able to realize the full value of our assets, we cannot make any assurances regarding the amount available for distribution to our shareholders.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We have made certain projections relating to the amount of cash the Company expects to have to distribute to its shareholders upon dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	These projections generally relate to the amount of liabilities which must be satisfied before our company is dissolved, the amount we expect preferred stockholders to receive for their equity interest.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Each of the above projections is subject to multiple variables, including the timing of a dissolution affecting the amount of dividends payable and the amount of liabilities owed at the time of dissolution.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	Based upon current estimates, if we were to dissolve this quarter, no assurance can be given that common shareholders or subordinate preferred shareholders will receive any such distribution.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	No additional funds were raised during the current financial period.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	We have spent $200,899 on plant and equipment for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily on new down hole tools acquired.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,512,441 through December 31, 2016 and incurred negative cash flow from continuing operations of $1,855,185 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our primary commitments include the minimum commitments under the license agreements.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We do not anticipate investing the additional $300,000 into the joint venture which we had originally committed.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Based upon our current plans, we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next twelve months, subject to any business strategy decisions taken by the Board of Directors.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our minimum commitments under the License Agreement for the next five years (assuming the License Agreement remains in effect and the $500,000 annual royalty payment with respect to the United States territory is not required to be paid), is summarized as follows:
1434110_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this Management Discussion Analysis, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to the individual Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The recorded derivative liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2015 were noted as subject to level III fair value measurements.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Accounting policies and estimates, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pledge Petroleum Corp. (f/k/a Propell Technologies Group Inc.) (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1434110_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Pledge Petroleum Corp. will continue as a going concern.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	As more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	The Company has also suspended its business operations.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P4_S4	Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 3.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	Pledge Petroleum Corp. (formerly Propell Technologies Group, Inc. and Propell Corporation) (the Company ), is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (doing business as Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (doing business as Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,897 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,722 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved and the operations of CMI were discontinued.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S4	On February 4, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S5	( Novas ) whereby the Company exchanged 100,000,000 shares of its common stock for 100,000,000 shares of common stock in Novas.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S6	After the consummation of the share exchange, Novas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S7	As a result of the share exchange the shareholders of Novas obtained the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P6_S8	As such, the exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of the Company and Novas was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the PPT) has not been found.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	The Board continues to evaluate its options including the possible sale of our technology and PPT assets, forming a special committee to investigate a possible share buyback of the majority shareholder, Ervington Investments, and/or a possible dissolution of the Company.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. ( Novas USA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. ( Technovita ) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the Joint Venture ), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ), dated October 22, 2015 (the Operating Agreement ), by and among Novas USA and Technovita.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement provides that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails to satisfy any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the Year 1 Milestone ).
1434110_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the Year 1 Key Performance Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015 each of: (1) sales from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and (4) EBITDA from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets of the Joint Venture, including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to Technovita solely for use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and its territories.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1434110_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	All amounts referred to in the notes to the financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary in which it has a majority voting interest.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
1434110_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other then quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The recorded derivative liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was noted as subject to level III fair value measurements.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).

1434110_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company s operations are carried out in the USA and Mexico.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the USA and Mexico and by the general state of those economies.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.

1434110_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the reporting entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and, therefore, consolidates the VIE.
1434110_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	A reporting entity has an indirect interest in a VIE if it has a direct interest in a related party that, in turn, has a direct interest in the VIE.

1434110_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have concluded that based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1434110_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1434110_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology ( PPT )) had not been found.
1434110_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	As a result, and in lieu of a potential dissolution, on March 23, 2018, we sold substantially all of our assets, including all pertinent intellectual property rights comprising our business of implementing plasma pulse technology (the Asset Sale ), to Norma Investments Limited ( Norma ), the parent company of Ervington Investments Limited ( Ervington ), the current holder of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, for $650,000 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement ) with Norma, dated February 12, 2018 (the Asset Purchase Agreement ).

1434110_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated.

1434110_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	In addition to historical information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the SEC.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	This report and other documents that we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management s assumptions.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	Words such as expect, outlook, forecast, would, could, should, project, intend, plan, continue, sustain , on track , believe, seek, estimate, anticipate, may, assume, and variations of such words and similar expressions are often used to identify such forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S5	Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P2_S6	Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the PPT) has not been found.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, and in lieu of a potential dissolution, on March 23, 2018, we sold substantially all of our assets, including all pertinent intellectual property rights comprising our business of implementing plasma pulse technology, to Norma I for $650,000 pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In connection with the Asset Sale, we also repurchased all of our outstanding securities held by Ervington for $8,500,000 pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible acquisition of a technology and oilfield services business, of which two of our current directors own a minority equity interest .
1434110_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	To date we have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,078,065 through December 31, 2017 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net revenues were $25,000 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The revenue during the current year is derived from one well treatment in Mexico.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Other than the treatment of one well in Mexico, all of our operations were directed through our 60% held joint venture, Novas Energy North America, LLC.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Effective November 1, 2016 we discontinued our NENA joint venture and the NENA operations are reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of non-controlling interest.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Cost of goods sold was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	All cost of goods sold related to our operations are reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of non-controlling interest.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross profit was $25,000 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to the revenue earned on the Mexican well treatments.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Total expenses were $627,732 and $2,913,235 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $2,285, 503 or 78.5%.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Total expenses consisted primarily of the following:
1434110_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Impairment charges of $0 and $899,254 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to the following; (i) impairment of the plasma pulse tools due to the Board of Directors abandoning the previous business plan with no new plan formulated as yet and no revenues forecast for the foreseeable future; and (ii) impairment of the remaining Mexican license agreement of $157,500 as no revenue has been generated from this market.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Other income was $0 and $193,667 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $193,667 or 100.0%, primarily due to the forgiveness of the once off license fee for the Mexican market of $200,000, which was due in June 2015.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $601,892 and $2,719,242 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $2,117,350 or 77.9%, which consists primarily of the reduction in total expenses of $2,285,503, offset by the forgiveness of the license fee income in the prior year as discussed above.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We incurred a net loss of $0 and $(1,649,064) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $1,649,064 or 100%.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The loss in the prior year was incurred by the NENA joint venture prior to its termination in November 2016.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of discontinued operations in the prior year of $249,339 is due to the losses in the Joint Venture being shared as to 40% by the non-controlling party until the full value of their investment of $600,000 was depleted.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The loss attributable to controlling interest of $601,892 and $4,118,967 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $3,517,075 or 85.4%.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease is primarily due to the discontinuance of the NENA joint venture in the prior year and a concerted effort by management to reduce operating costs while the directors contemplated the business strategy.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	A deemed preferred stock dividend of $626,000 and $627,714 has been disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	This amount represents the dividends that are due, but remain undeclared, to Series B and Series C preferred stock holders.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	We incurred a net loss of $1,227,892 and $4,746,681 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, a decrease of $3,518,789 or 74.1%, respectively and which consists of the various items discussed above.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Although we had a cash balance of $8,599,620 as of December 31, 2017, of which $749,620 is not restricted, we have a history of annual losses from operations since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	We have recently disposed of substantially all of our assets for $650,000 and simultaneously therewith acquired the entire shareholding of Ervington, for gross proceeds of $8,500,000.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	We are actively looking to acquire businesses in a similar field which may require substantial cash.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	No additional funds were raised during the current financial period.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $19,114,333 through December 31, 2017 and incurred negative cash flow from continuing operations of $570,136 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this Management Discussion Analysis, where such policies have a material effect on reported and expected financial results.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to the individual Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the service is completed without further obligation, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near-term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	We did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	We did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	For a discussion of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Accounting policies and estimates, in the Notes to Financial Statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pledge Petroleum Corp. and Subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, will require additional capital to fund its current operating plan, and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P4_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	Pledge Petroleum Corp. (formerly Propell Technologies Group, Inc. and Propell Corporation) (the Company ), is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. ( CMI ), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Propell s, and the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	On May 6, 2008, the Company acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (doing business as Arrow Media Solutions) ( AMS ) and Auleron 2005, LLC (doing business as Auleron Technologies) ( AUL ) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,897 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,722 shares of the Company s common stock to the members of AUL.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S3	In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved and the operations of CMI were discontinued.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S4	On February 4, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Novas Energy (USA), Inc.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S5	( Novas ) whereby the Company exchanged 100,000,000 shares of its common stock for 100,000,000 shares of common stock in Novas.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S6	After the consummation of the share exchange, Novas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S7	As a result of the share exchange the shareholders of Novas obtained the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P7_S8	As such, the exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of the Company and Novas was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	During the past year, the Company s management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, had evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the PPT) had not been found.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	On March 23, 2018, after obtaining approval of the majority shareholder and the majority of the minority of the shareholders we sold substantially all of our assets for $650,000 and simultaneously therewith the entire shareholding of the majority shareholder, Ervington was purchased by us for gross proceeds of $8,500,000.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are currently exploring the acquisition of assets or businesses in the oil and water treatment segments.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. ( Novas USA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. ( Technovita ) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the Joint Venture ), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ), dated October 22, 2015 (the Operating Agreement ), by and among Novas USA and Technovita.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement provided that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails to satisfy any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the Year 1 Milestone ).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the Year 1 Key Performance Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015 each of: (1) sales from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and (4) EBITDA from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets of the Joint Venture, including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to Technovita solely for use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and its territories.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	All amounts referred to in the notes to the financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary in which it has a majority voting interest.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
1434110_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near-term due to one or more future confirming events.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
1434110_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including the potential risk of business failure.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company s operations were carried out in the USA and Mexico.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the USA and Mexico and by the general state of those economies.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	The Company s results could have been adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2017-02, an amendment to Topic 805, Business Combinations.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The amendments in this Update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	The amendments in this Update affect all reporting entities that must determine whether they have acquired or sold a business.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	The amendments in this Update provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S4	The amendments in this Update apply to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S5	The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S6	No disclosures are required at transition.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P30_S7	The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, an amendment to Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, an entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	Because these amendments eliminate Step 3 from the goodwill impairment test, they should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	An entity should apply the amendments in this Update on a prospective basis.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	The amendments in this Update are effective for Goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P31_S5	We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, an amendment to Subtopic 610-20, Other Income Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	The amendments in this Update are required for public business entities and other entities that have goodwill reported in their financial statements, under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	The amendments in this Update modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S3	An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S4	An entity should apply the amendments in this Update on a prospective basis.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S5	The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S6	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P32_S7	We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2017-05 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	This Update is being issued primarily to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	This Update also includes amendments to the Overview and Background Sections of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), defined benefit pension cost and postretirement benefit cost (net benefit cost) comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Those components are aggregated for reporting in the financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	The amendments in this Update apply to all employers, including not-for-profit entities, that offer to their employees defined benefit pension plans, other postretirement benefit plans, or other types of benefits accounted for under Topic 715.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	The amendments in this Update require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	The amendments also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allow only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those 3 annual periods.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	For other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit in assets.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2017-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20) Premium Amortization of Purchased Callable Debt Securities.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The amendments in this Update affect all entities that hold investments in callable debt securities that have an amortized cost basis in excess of the amount that is repayable by the issuer at the earliest call date (that is, at a premium).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	The amendments in this Update shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Under current GAAP, premiums and discounts on callable debt securities generally are amortized to the maturity date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	The amendments in this Update more closely align the amortization period of premiums and discounts to expectations incorporated in market pricing on the underlying securities.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	As a result, the amendments more closely align interest income recorded on bonds held at a premium or a discount with the economics of the underlying instrument.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S4	For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S5	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S6	If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S7	An entity should apply the amendments in this Update on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S8	Additionally, in the period of adoption, an entity should provide disclosures about a change in accounting principle.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P39_S9	We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2017-08 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation, an amendment to Topic 718.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. 2.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met:
1434110_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	If the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The current disclosure requirements in Topic 718 apply regardless of whether an entity is required to apply modification accounting under the amendments in this Update.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	The amendments proposed in this ASU are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-10, service concession arrangements, an amendment to Topic 853.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Topic 853 provides guidance for operating entities when they enter into a service concession arrangement with a public-sector grantor who both:
1434110_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Controls, through ownership, beneficial entitlement, or otherwise, any residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	In a service concession arrangement within the scope of Topic 853, the operating entity should not account for the infrastructure as a lease or as property, plant, and equipment.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	An operating entity should refer to other Topics to account for various aspects of a service concession arrangement.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	For example, an operating entity should account for revenue relating to construction, upgrade, or operation services in accordance with Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The amendments in this Update apply to the accounting by operating entities for service concession arrangements within the scope of Topic 853.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	These updates are effective when the Company adopts the updates to Topic 606.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The amendments proposed in this ASU are not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	In July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).
1434110_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The amendments in this Update provide guidance about:
1434110_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered.
1434110_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS.

1434110_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The amendments in Part 1 of this Update should be applied in either of the following ways: 1.

1434110_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	Retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature for each prior reporting period presented in accordance with the guidance on accounting changes in paragraphs 250-10-45-5 through 45-10.

1434110_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	Other than disclosed above, in accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to December 31, 2017 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), who also serves as our principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO who also serves as our principal financial and accounting officer concluded that due to a lack of segregation of duties and insufficient controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Once we acquire a new business, we intend to retain additional individuals to remedy the ineffective controls.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our year ended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	It also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1434110_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
