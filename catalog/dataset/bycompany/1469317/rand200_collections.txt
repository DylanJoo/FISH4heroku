1469317_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Partnership may in the future trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts (together with futures contracts and currencies, Commodity Interests ).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Under the Partnership s Agreement of Limited Partnership (the Limited Partnership Agreement ), Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds), an Arkansas corporation ( Altegris Funds or the General Partner ), serves as general partner of the Partnership and has sole responsibility for management and administration of all aspects of the Partnership s business.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	Investors purchasing limited partnership interests (the Interests ) in the Partnership ( Limited Partners and together with the General Partner, Partners ) have no rights to participate in the management of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Altegris Funds is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) as a Commodity Pool Operator ( CPO ), and is a member of National Futures Association ( NFA ).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Quantitative Investment Management LLC, a Virginia limited liability company formed in May 2003, acts as the Partnership s trading advisor ( QIM or the Advisor ).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	QIM became registered as a Commodity Trading Advisor ( CTA ) in 2004 and a CPO in 2005 and is a member of NFA.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	Effective as of December 31, 2010, Altegris Funds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. ( Genworth ).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	Genworth became a principal of Altegris Funds and Altegris Futures, L.L.C. ( Altegris Futures ), an affiliate of the General Partner, in January 2011.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Altegris Investments, Inc.

1469317_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Partnership s term will end upon the first to occur of the following: receipt by the General Partner of an election to dissolve the Partnership at a specified time by Limited Partners owning more than 50% of the Interests then outstanding, notice of which is sent by registered mail to the General Partner not less than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of such dissolution; withdrawal, admitted or court decreed insolvency or dissolution of the General Partner unless at such time there is at least one remaining General Partner in the Partnership; or any event that makes it unlawful for the existence of the Partnership to be continued or requiring termination of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Partnership is not required to be, and is not, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of February 28, 2011, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $127,683,106.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership offers three classes of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a Class of Interest ).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors over 50 tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in U.S. government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	QIM will target an average margin to equity level of between 5% and 20%.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at Newedge USA in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership as described under Charges.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at Newedge USA could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at Newedge USA as described above, but deposited with Wilmington Trust Company (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its sub-advisor, Wilmington Trust Investment Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Custodian that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as an investment adviser.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances, commercial paper and repurchase agreements subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or Newedge USA, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Altegris Funds receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	QIM receives a 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Newedge USA paid Altegris during 2010 and will pay Altegris Futures from and after January 1, 2011 a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, during the first twelve months after the Partnership commenced trading, the General Partner agreed to limit the operating expenses paid by the Partnership to 1/12 th of 0.5% of the month-end capital account balances of all Interests for such month.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to Altegris Funds equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as Altegris Funds, commodity trading advisors such as QIM and commodity brokers or FCMs such as Newedge USA and introducing brokers such as Altegris Futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	All accounts owned or managed by QIM will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	QIM could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S5	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P32_S6	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for QIM to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Currency forward contracts currently are not subject to regulation by any U.S. government agency.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	In January 2011, the CFTC proposed a separate position limits regime for 28 so-called exempt (i.e. metals and energy) and agricultural futures and options contracts and their economically equivalent swap contracts.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Position limits in spot months are proposed to be 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a non-spot month a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	The General Partner believes that the proposed limits are sufficiently large that if adopted, they should not restrict the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Currency forward contracts are not currently subject to regulation by any United States ( U.S. ) Government agency.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets for the first time.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Reform Act will mandate that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Reform Act also amended the definition of eligible contract participant, and the CFTC is interpreting that definition in a such manner that the Partnership may no longer be permitted to engage in forward currency transactions by directly accessing the interbank market.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Rather, when the Reform Act goes into effect in July 2011, the Partnership may be limited to engaging in retail forex transactions which could limit the Partnership s potential forward currency counterparties to futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	Limiting on the Partnership s potential forward currency counterparties in this manner could lead to the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	The retail forex markets could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	Moreover, the creditworthiness of the futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers with which the Partnership may be required to trade could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which the Partnership currently engages for its forward currency transactions.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P38_S5	Although the impact of requiring the Partnership to conduct forward currency transactions in the retail market could be substantial, the full scope is currently unknown and the ultimate effect could also be negligible.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.
1469317_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Employees of Altegris, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. as of December 31, 2010, perform all administrative services for the Partnership from offices at 1202 Bergen Parkway, Suite 212, Evergreen, Colorado 80439 or at 1200 Prospect St., Suite 400, La Jolla, California 92037.
1469317_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving Altegris Funds or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2011 the Partnership had 1,824 holders of Interests.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	Altegris Funds has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and Altegris Funds has no present intention to make any.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2010:
1469317_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2010 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by Newedge USA and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2010, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $275,424 from its trading of commodity futures contracts including brokerage commissions of $1,178,732.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued net expenses of $2,520,021, including $375,888 in incentive fees, $904,887 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,094,195 in service and professional fees.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $340,113 in interest income during 2010.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2010 is set forth below.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in October of 2010 as the Partnership exploited falling US Government debt yields which pushed the US Dollar lower against the Japanese yen.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Volatility in gold futures proved to be profitable for the Partnership during the month and soybean futures trading added significantly to the month s returns.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Trading in silver and natural gas futures also made a meaningful contribution to the gains achieved for the month.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in November of 2010 as performance trailed off during the month s second and third weeks.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Corn and sugar futures accounted for the biggest gains in agricultural trading, as sugar hit a 30-year high during the month.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	The Partnership later profited from a short position during a sharp sell-off of sugar.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	After an excellent start to the month in crude oil futures trading, the Partnership suffered losses as crude oil made significant downward moves mid month.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Partnership experienced a gain in December with trading in stock index futures, interest rates and currencies contributing to profits.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Euro currency trading was profitable as the Partnership moved between long and short positions in the currency.
1469317_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	Futures trading in crude oil, equity indexes and bonds also yielded solid profits to help achieve gains during the month.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and the results of its operations and changes in partners' capital for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period October 7, 2009 (inception of trading) to December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) (formerly APM QIM Futures Fund, L.P.) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) Government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and Futures Commission Merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Partnership follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	The FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) that the Partnership follows to ensure consistent reporting of the Partnership s financial condition, results of operations, and changes in partners capital.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	References to GAAP issued by the FASB in these footnotes are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification referred to as ASC .
1469317_11_ITEM15_P18_S3	The FASB finalized the ASC effective for periods ending on or after September 15, 2009.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of certain estimates made by the Partnership s management.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Pursuant to the Cash Flows Topic of the Codification, the Partnership qualifies for an exemption from the requirement to provide a statement of cash flows and has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and other highly liquid investments with financial institutions with original maturity dates of 90 days or less.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Security transactions are recorded on the trade date.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	Realized gains and losses from security transactions are determined using the identified cost method.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the statement of operations.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Brokerage commissions and other trading fees are reflected as an adjustment to cost or proceeds at the time of the transaction.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	Gains or losses on futures contracts and options on futures contracts are realized when contracts are liquidated.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	Net unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and quoted market price) are reflected in the statement of financial condition.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the statement of operations.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	Brokerage commissions on futures and options on futures contracts include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Partnership values its investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 - Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820 ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	Under ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Partnership has the ability to access.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Valuation adjustments and blockage discounts are not applied to Level 1 assets and liabilities.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Because valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these assets and liabilities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P36_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Partnership values futures and options on futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Partnership includes futures and options on futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	The fair value of U.S. Government bonds is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs that include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	U.S. Government bonds are generally categorized in Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	The fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), bond spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as of the bond.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Corporate bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	In instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The industry classifications included in the condensed schedule of investments represent the General Partner s belief as to the most meaningful presentation of the classification of the Partnership s investments.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:
1469317_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Financial Derivative Instruments for the fair value in each type of contract within this category.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the statement of financial condition.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P50_S3	Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Partnership accounts for subscriptions, allocations and redemptions on a per partner capital account basis.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Partnership consists of the General Partner s Interest, Special Interests, Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests (collectively referred to as Interests ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests were first issued by the Partnership on October 1, 2009.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Income or loss (prior to management fees, administrative fees, service fees and incentive fees) are allocated pro rata among the partners based on their respective capital accounts as of the end of each month in which the items accrue pursuant to the terms of the Partnership s agreement of limited partnership, as may be amended and restated from time to time (the Agreement ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	Special Interests, Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests are then charged with their applicable management fee, administrative fee, service fee and incentive fee in accordance with the Agreement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Partnership is not subject to federal income taxes; each partner reports his allocable share of income, gain, loss, deductions or credits on its own income tax return.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Partnership classifies interest and penalties, if any, as interest expense.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Partnership files U.S. federal and state tax returns.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	The 2010 and 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Partnership applies the provisions of Codification Topics 740, Income Taxes ; and 835, Interest , which prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity before being measured and recognized in the financial statements.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	This accounting standard requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Partnership s financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	Tax positions with respect to tax at the Partnership level not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P57_S3	The General Partner has concluded there is no tax expense or interest expense related to uncertainties in income tax positions for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and the 2009.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The General Partner has incurred all expenses in connection with the initial organization of the Partnership, totaling approximately $64,000.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	The General Partner bills the Partnership in monthly installments for such expenses over a sixty month period beginning in the thirteenth month after the Partnership commenced operations.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	If the Partnership were to cease operations prior to the end of the sixty month period, the Partnership would not be obligated to pay the General Partner for the unbilled costs.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Offering costs incurred in connection with the ongoing offering of the Partnership s interests are borne by the Partnership.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	These costs include, but are not limited to, legal fees pertaining to updating Partnership s offering documents and materials, accounting and printing costs.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	These costs are charged to partners capital as incurred.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC, nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	ASU 2010-06 amends the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the Codification to add new disclosure requirements about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	It also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to the levels of disaggregation for fair value measurement and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P65_S3	ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on the Partnership s financial statements.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Partnership s trading activities are conducted pursuant to an advisory contract with Quantitative Investment Management LLC (QIM) ( Advisor ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Partnership pays the Advisor a quarterly incentive fee of 30% of the trading profits (as defined).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	However, the quarterly incentive fee is payable only on cumulative profits, calculated separately for each partner s interest, achieved from commodity trading (as defined).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Newedge USA, LLC is the Partnership s commodity broker (the Clearing Broker ), pursuant to the terms of a brokerage agreement.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	Altegris has entered into a selling agreement with the Partnership whereby it receives 2% per annum as continuing compensation for Class A Interests sold by Altegris that are outstanding at month end.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P75_S2	Altegris, as the Partnership s introducing broker, also receives a portion of the commodity brokerage commissions paid by the Partnership to the Clearing Broker and interest income retained by the Clearing Broker.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	Brokerage charges may exceed the flat rate described above, depending on commission and trading volume levels, which may vary.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	Investments in the Partnership are made by subscription agreement, subject to acceptance by the General Partner.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Partnership is not required to make distributions, but may do so at the sole discretion of the General Partner.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	The General Partner may request and receive redemption of capital, subject to the same terms as any Limited Partner.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P79_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	However if, in the future, the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Partnership s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Partnership has cash deposited with Wilmington Trust Company ( Custodian ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	For cash not held with the Clearing Broker, the Partnership receives cash management services from an affiliate of the Custodian, Wilmington Trust Investment Management ( WTIM ).
1469317_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with WTIM in U.S. Government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	Management of the Partnership evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	There are no subsequent events to disclose.

1469317_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	Total return and the ratios to average net asset value are calculated for each class of Limited Partners capital taken as a whole.
1469317_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.

1469317_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of February 29, 2012, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $118,884,093.

1469317_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership offers three classes of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a Class of Interest ).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors over 50 tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	QIM will target an average margin to equity level of between 4% and 18%.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at Newedge USA in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership as described under Charges.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at Newedge USA could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at Newedge USA as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate, J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances, commercial paper and repurchase agreements subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or Newedge USA, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Altegris Funds receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	QIM receives a 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Newedge USA paid Altegris during 2011 and will pay Altegris Futures from and after January 1, 2012 a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	However, during the first twelve months after the Partnership commenced trading, the General Partner agreed to limit the operating expenses paid by the Partnership to 1/12 th of 0.5% of the month-end capital account balances of all Interests for such month.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to Altegris Funds equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as Altegris Funds, commodity trading advisors such as QIM and commodity brokers or FCMs such as Newedge USA and introducing brokers such as Altegris Futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	All accounts owned or managed by QIM will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S4	QIM could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S5	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P31_S6	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for QIM to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Currency forward contracts currently are not subject to regulation by any U.S. government agency.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	In January 2011, the CFTC proposed a separate position limits regime for 28 so-called exempt (i.e. metals and energy) and agricultural futures and options contracts and their economically equivalent swap contracts.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Position limits in spot months are proposed to be 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a non-spot month a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	The General Partner believes that the proposed limits are sufficiently large that if adopted, they should not restrict the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Currency forward contracts are not currently subject to regulation by any U.S. Government agency.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets for the first time.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Reform Act will mandate that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Reform Act also amended the definition of eligible contract participant, and the CFTC may interpret that definition in such a manner that the Partnership may no longer be permitted to engage in forward currency transactions by directly accessing the interbank market.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	If is does so (final rules are still pending), the Partnership may be limited to engaging in retail forex transactions which could limit the Partnership s potential forward currency counterparties to futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	Limiting on the Partnership s potential forward currency counterparties in this manner could lead to the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	The retail forex markets could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	Moreover, the creditworthiness of the futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers with which the Partnership may be required to trade could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which the Partnership currently engages for its forward currency transactions.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	Although the impact of requiring the Partnership to conduct forward currency transactions in the retail market could be substantial, the full scope is currently unknown and the ultimate effect could also be negligible.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.
1469317_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Employees of Altegris, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. as of December 31, 2010, perform all administrative services for the Partnership from offices at 1202 Bergen Parkway, Suite 212, Evergreen, Colorado 80439 or at 1200 Prospect St., Suite 400, La Jolla, California 92037.
1469317_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving Altegris Funds or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 29, 2012 the Partnership had 1,769 holders of Interests.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Altegris Funds has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and Altegris Funds has no present intention to make any.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2011:
1469317_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2011 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by Newedge USA and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2011, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $4,717,099 from its trading activities, including brokerage commissions of $1,941,056.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $4,497,909, including $969,544 in incentive fees, $1,462,413 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,714,967 in service and professional fees.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Trading in Euro futures continued to be strong as the currency gained in conjunction with renewed investor confidence.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	Crude oil futures also played a positive role in the month s final tally.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	On the first of the month, when the program was largely short stock index futures and long interest rates, the Greek government called for a referendum on the latest bailout package causing the markets to fall and interest rate futures to rally sharply, producing large gains.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	Euro-Bund and Dax futures were the most profitable contracts during the month, as the Partnership took advantage of continued volatility in Europe.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Trading in futures contracts on US Treasury notes and bonds proved challenging as news continued to fuel uncertainty regarding the European monetary union.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Euro currency and Euro-Bund trading were among the Partnership s most lucrative contracts.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Performance was boosted by gold and silver trading as the gold markets reached an all-time high.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The end of the month saw global markets falter and the Partnership s short stock index positions and long interest rate positions, generated gains for the month.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Partnership began the month with gains primarily from its positions in US and European stock index futures, but concerns regarding the European debt crisis and the downgrade of US Government debt drove markets significantly lower.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2011, as news of the severity of the Japanese nuclear crisis hurt long positions the Partnership held in futures contracts on global equities, the U.S. dollar and crude oil.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Partnership also held short positions in futures contracts in silver, as the price of silver posted its largest monthly gain in nearly 30 years, making silver the worst performing market this month.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Gains in trading futures contracts in gold, the Australian dollar and European interest rates were not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in May 2011.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Long positions in futures on the U.S. dollar and short crude positions exploited weaknesses in those markets and led to modest gains.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Despite these early gains, the Partnership closed the month with six consecutive down days on trading in futures contracts on foreign currencies, silver, and U.S. equities.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	February saw the Partnership s performance fall slightly during the month.

1469317_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Partnership s long positions in foreign currencies dropped as the U.S. Dollar reacted strongly to better than expected U.S. employment numbers.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Partnership s interest rate trading also suffered as rates reacted strongly to the employment report.
1469317_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Interest rate futures contributed positively, but gold trading experienced losses.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the period October 7, 2009 (inception of trading) to December 31, 2009, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years and period then ended.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P18_S2	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable, however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that differences could be material.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Partnership has the ability to access.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Partnership values futures and options on futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Partnership includes futures and options on futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	The fair value of U.S. Government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs that include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	U.S. Government agency bonds and notes are generally categorized in Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	There were no fair value U.S. Government agency bonds and notes at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as of the notes.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Corporate notes are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	In instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	There were no fair value corporate notes at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	There were no changes in the Fund s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010:

1469317_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Brokerage commissions on futures and options on futures contracts include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Partnership may engage in futures contracts as part of its investment strategy to hedge against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the value of securities it intends to purchase.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the change in value of the investments that are intended to hedge against.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2011 are reflected within the Condensed Schedule of Investments.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the statement of financial condition.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and other highly liquid investments with financial institutions containing original maturity dates of 90 days or less.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	A portion of the cash designated as Equity in Newedge USA, LLC is restricted and held as margin collateral for futures transactions.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Partnership maintains a custody account with a major financial institution.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	At times, the Partnership s cash balance could exceed the insured amount under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).

1469317_12_ITEM15_P55_S3	The Partnership has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not subject to any significant credit risk related to its cash account.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The General Partner has incurred all expenses in connection with the initial organization of the Partnership, totaling approximately $64,000.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	The General Partner bills the Partnership in monthly installments for such expenses over a sixty month period beginning in the thirteenth month after the Partnership commenced operations.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	If the Partnership were to cease operations prior to the end of the sixty month period, the Partnership would not be obligated to pay the General Partner for the unbilled costs.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Partnership prepares and files calendar year U.S. and applicable state information tax returns and reports to the partners their allocable shares of the Partnership s income and expenses.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Partnership is required to determine whether its tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners capital.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	Based on its analysis, the Partnership has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P59_S4	However, the Partnership s conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Partnership is not required to make distributions, but may do so at the sole discretion of the General Partner.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	A Limited Partner may request and receive redemption of capital, subject to restrictions set forth in the Agreement.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	The General Partner may request and receive redemption of capital, subject to the same terms as any Limited Partner.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	No Limited Partner shall be liable for any debts or liabilities of the Partnership or any losses thereof in excess of such Limited Partner's capital contributions, except as may be required by law.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Partnership accounts for subscriptions, allocations and redemptions on a per partner capital account basis.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Partnership consists of the General Partner s Interest, Special Interests, Class A Interests, Class B Interests and Institutional Interests (collectively referred to as Interests ).
1469317_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	Income or loss (prior to management fees, administrative fees, service fees and incentive fees) is allocated pro rata among the partners based on their respective capital accounts as of the end of each month in which the items accrue pursuant to the terms of the Partnership s agreement of limited partnership, as may be amended and restated from time to time (the Agreement ).

1469317_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Altegris Investments, Inc. and Altegris Futures, L.L.C.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	Altegris Investments, Inc. ( Altegris Investments ), an affiliate of the General Partner, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification, nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P83_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the statement of financial condition.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following presents the trading results of the Partnership s derivative trading and information related to the volume of the Partnership s derivative activity for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the period ended October 7, 2009 (inception of trading) to December 31, 2009.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the statement of operations.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	However if, in the future, the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	For cash not held with the Clearing Broker, the Partnership receives cash management services from an affiliate of the Custodian, J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_12_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. Government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-04 Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) .

1469317_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to disclose the following information for fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, the valuation processes used by the reporting entity, and a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs.
1469317_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	In addition, ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to make disclosures about amounts and reasons for all transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.

1469317_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.

1469317_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of February 28, 2013, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $131,791,155.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership offers three classes of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a Class of Interest ).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors over 50 tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).

1469317_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at J.P. Morgan Securities in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership as described under Charges.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at J.P. Morgan Securities could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at J.P. Morgan Securities as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances and commercial paper subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or J.P. Morgan Securities, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Altegris Funds receives a management fee of 0.104% of the prior month ending net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the prior month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	QIM receives a 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Partnership s clearing broker paid during 2012 and will pay from and after January 1, 2013 to Altegris Futures a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Newedge USA, LLC ( Newedge ) served as the clearing broker for the Partnership until August 2012, at which point J.P. Morgan Securities became the clearing broker for the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Newedge continues to serve as a reserve clearing broker for the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	However, during the first twelve months after the Partnership commenced trading, the General Partner agreed to limit the operating expenses paid by the Partnership to 1/12 th of 0.5% of the month-end capital account balances of all Interests for such month.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to Altegris Funds equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, swap dealers , major swap participants and, in most cases, their respective associated persons, as well as floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as Altegris Funds, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as J.P. Morgan Securities and introducing brokers such as Altegris Futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Similar position limits may in the future be put in place with respect to swaps that are exchange-traded or are economically equivalent to exchange-traded swaps or futures contracts.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Certain deliverable currency forward contracts are subject to limited regulation in the United States, including reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to the registration requirements described above, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	The CFTC may in the future also implement position limits for certain exempt commodity contracts, including metals and energy contracts, with respect to futures, options on futures, and economically equivalent swaps.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Position limits in spot months are proposed to be 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a non-spot month a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	If such position limits are adopted, they could materially affect the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Deliverable currency forward contracts are currently subject to only limited regulation in the United States.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets for the first time.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.

1469317_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving Altegris Funds or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.

1469317_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2012:
1469317_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2012 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by J.P. Morgan Securities and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2012, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $9,028,017 from all trading; gains of $8,912,060 from trading of futures contracts including brokerage commissions of $1,916,974.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $7,804,749, including $4,320,095 in incentive fees, $1,454,056 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,503,361 in service and professional fees.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $146,654 in interest income during 2012.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2012 is set forth below.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2012 as losses in interest rates eclipsed modest gains in European equities, currencies, and energies.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The month started strong, with long equities and encouraging U.S. economic data delivering positive returns.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Performance eventually sagged, however, as long U.S. Treasury and European bond positions contravened market trends.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in November 2012 as performance was dominated by positions in futures contracts on the S P 500.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Long equity signals failed to anticipate heavy losses after the U.S. presidential election.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	These losses worsened when equity signals switched to short the following week just prior to an unexpected surge in these same markets.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Partnership achieved modest gains throughout the month in its trading of futures contracts on European bonds and the Japanese Yen, but not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2012 primarily through profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices on high volatility during the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European equities, and short positions on U.S. Treasuries capitalized on a generally upward trend in stock markets during the first half of the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	The second half of the month saw stock markets turn downward; however, by this time the Partnership s futures contracts on U.S equities positions had switched to short through the remainder of the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	Performance during the month was also driven by gains on a long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund, as well as profits in currency futures trading.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2012 as poor employment numbers in the U.S. and continued concern about the fiscal health of Spain and Italy caused the equity markets to slide and treasury prices to rise, both working against the Partnership s positions.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Eurobund accounted for over half of the losses for the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The Partnership also struggled in the stock index sector, with futures contracts on the S P being the worst performer.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Short positions in Crude Oil also hurt performance as prices spiked during the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Short positions in most of the foreign currencies contributed positively with a short Euro position being the best performer.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	The Partnership finished August 2012 with a slight gain.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S6	Long stock index futures positions drove performance during the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S7	The month began negatively for stocks and treasuries, but the outlook changed with an unexpectedly positive U.S. employment report.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S8	Interest rates generated significant losses for the month, with a short Eurobund position in the second half of the month being the biggest loser.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S9	Crude oil prices rose steadily, contravening our mostly month-long short position.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S10	Currencies additionally dragged down returns as long positions in the Australian Dollar and Euro yielded losses.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S11	The Partnership ended September relatively flat with equity positions having delivered the bulk of the gains, offset by losses in interest rate positions.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P12_S12	Other notable contributors were profitable positions in futures contracts on energies, particularly Crude Oil, as well as lucrative positions in Gold and Copper.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Interest rate futures and currency futures hurt performance considerably.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in April 2012.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Partnership held long positions for the entire month in interest rate futures contracts, as poor March U.S. employment data and Spain s downgrade by S P drove interest rate futures higher.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Partnership started the month short futures contracts on stock indices and reversed to a long position after the S P declined five consecutive days.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	The Partnership stayed with that long position for the rest of the month as the S P was able to recover most of its losses from earlier in the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	Trading in currency, metal, energy and agricultural sectors all produced losses, but the Partnership s exposure in these sectors was less significant.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in May 2012, as poor U.S. employment data in the beginning of the month started equities on a downward slide.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices were well positioned to profit during the decline.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Partnership also benefitted from its long positions in the 10-year note and 30-year bond throughout the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The most significant contributions to performance during the month came from trading in futures contracts on stock indices, interest rates and currencies.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in June 2012 based largely on long futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Equity markets rallied on the release of strong U.S. economic data.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Futures contracts on crude oil led the Partnership s energy sector trading.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Trading in futures contracts on currencies was the worst performing sector during the month as the dollar struggled during the first three weeks of the month, while the Partnership held short positions.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2012, with losses highly concentrated in the interest rate sector.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Positions in futures contracts on US Treasuries were the worst performing during the month, however, the Partnership also struggled with positions in futures contracts on the Euro currency, Euro-Bund and Dax.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Partnership earned gains in its trading of futures contracts on US equity indices, but it was not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2012 on poor trading in interest rate futures for the second consecutive month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Energy trading buoyed the month s performance with futures contracts on crude oil and brent crude representing the month s two best performing contracts as the Partnership took advantage of the long rally in oil prices.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in March 2012.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	During the first half of March, the positive economic data in the US drove interest rate futures down at a time when the Partnership was heavily short that sector.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	Subdued data from China, Europe and the US housing market also contributed to the rally in interest rate futures for the remainder of the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	While the Partnership lightened its exposure to US interest rates, positions in the European rates lead to losses in those markets.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P17_S9	The Partnership profited from its trading of futures contracts on the short side of the Yen and on the long side of E-mini S P contracts during the month.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2011 is set forth below.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in October 2011 as the program continued to benefit from turbulence in stock index and interest rate futures.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Equity markets rebounded strongly from their five-month free fall; however, markets began to sell off again at month-end.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Partnership profitably traded Euro-Bund futures contracts and took advantage of rising interest rates on the long end of the US yield curve.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Trading in Euro futures continued to be strong as the currency gained in conjunction with renewed investor confidence.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	Crude oil futures also played a positive role in the month s final tally.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in November 2011 booking large gains on the first and last day of the month, and was profitable on five of the last six trading days of November.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S6	On the first of the month, when the program was largely short stock index futures and long interest rates, the Greek government called for a referendum on the latest bailout package causing the markets to fall and interest rate futures to rally sharply, producing large gains.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P19_S7	Euro-Bund and Dax futures were the most profitable contracts during the month, as the Partnership took advantage of continued volatility in Europe.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2011.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Trading in futures contracts on US Treasury notes and bonds proved challenging as news continued to fuel uncertainty regarding the European monetary union.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Partnership also lost money in futures contracts on the Nasdaq and S P 500.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Euro currency and Euro-Bund trading were among the Partnership s most lucrative contracts.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Performance in July was positive as trading in interest rate futures showed solid gains.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Performance was boosted by gold and silver trading as the gold markets reached an all-time high.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The end of the month saw global markets falter and the Partnership s short stock index positions and long interest rate positions, generated gains for the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	August saw mixed performance for the Partnership as world equity markets, which had fallen significantly in the last week of July, fell even more rapidly in the first week of August.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Partnership began the month with gains primarily from its positions in US and European stock index futures, but concerns regarding the European debt crisis and the downgrade of US Government debt drove markets significantly lower.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P23_S6	The Partnership profited by reversing its positions as the markets rallied during the second week of the month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2011, as news of the severity of the Japanese nuclear crisis hurt long positions the Partnership held in futures contracts on global equities, the U.S. dollar and crude oil.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The Partnership also held short positions in futures contracts in silver, as the price of silver posted its largest monthly gain in nearly 30 years, making silver the worst performing market this month.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Gains in trading futures contracts in gold, the Australian dollar and European interest rates were not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Long positions in futures on the U.S. dollar and short crude positions exploited weaknesses in those markets and led to modest gains.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	The Partnership traded well in futures contracts on U.S. and European bonds boosting returns in interest rates, however performance overall was negative at month end.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Partnership was well positioned to take advantage of movements in the price of futures contracts on the Euro, which secured some gains.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	An extended short position in futures contracts on Silver also added positively to performance.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Partnership ended the month down on difficult trading of crude oil futures at the end of the month.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	The Partnership participated on both sides of the market as volatility in the medium and long-term U.S. treasury futures helped to generate profits.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P26_S11	Gains in trading futures contracts on the Euro were offset by losses in futures contracts on the U.S. Treasury markets, as the Partnership ended the month down.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	During 2010, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $275,424 from all trading; gains of $248,920 from trading of futures contracts including brokerage commissions of $1,178,732.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Partnership started the month strongly, spurred by long positions in gold, silver and copper contracts.

1469317_13_ITEM7_P32_S8	Stock index futures trading generated positive returns as equity market volatilities retreated.
1469317_13_ITEM7_P32_S9	A positive month in metals trading was primarily attributable to continued increases in the price of gold which again reached an all-time high.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. (the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, statements of changes in partners capital and financial highlights for each of the two years in the periods then ended.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P10_S3	The financial statements and financial highlights of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2010, were audited by other auditors whose report dated March 25, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1469317_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P11_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P11_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2012, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	The financial statements and financial highlights of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2010, were audited by other auditors whose report dated March 25, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds) ("General Partner").
1469317_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and Futures Commission Merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Partnership has the ability to access.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P28_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs which include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	U.S. government agency bonds and notes are generally categorized in Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	No U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Corporate notes are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	No corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011:

1469317_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Partnership may invest in futures contracts as part of its investment strategy.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss) on futures contracts.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the Statements of Financial Condition.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners capital.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Partnership pays brokerage commissions to the Clearing Broker for clearing trades on its behalf, which are reflected in the Statements of Operations as Brokerage Commissions.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Partnership engages in futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification, nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following presents the trading results of the Partnership s derivative trading and information related to the volume of the Partnership s derivative activity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Operations.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P87_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Partnership has cash deposited with the Custodian.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	For cash not held with the Clearing Broker, the Partnership receives cash management services from an affiliate of the Custodian, J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_13_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	Total return and the ratios to average net asset value are calculated for each class of Limited Partners capital taken as a whole.
1469317_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.

1469317_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	General Partner of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.

1469317_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership is not required to be, and is not, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	As of February 28, 2014, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $77,778,805.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership offers three classes of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a Class of Interest ).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors over 50 tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	QIM will generally maintain an average margin to equity level of between 0% and 20%.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	It is expected that between 5% and 20% of the Partnership s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or U.S. Treasury Department ( Treasury ) securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ( J.P. Morgan Securities ), a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at J.P. Morgan Securities in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership as described under Charges.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at J.P. Morgan Securities could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at J.P. Morgan Securities as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances and commercial paper subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or J.P. Morgan Securities, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Altegris Funds receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	QIM receives a 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	J.P. Morgan Securities paid during 2013 to Altegris Futures a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, during the first twelve months after the Partnership commenced trading, the General Partner agreed to limit the operating expenses paid by the Partnership to 1/12 th of 0.5% of the month-end capital account balances of all Interests for such month.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to Altegris Funds equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, swap dealers , major swap participants and, in most cases, their respective associated persons, as well as floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as Altegris Funds, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as J.P. Morgan Securities and introducing brokers such as Altegris Futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	Similar position limits may in the future be put in place with respect to swaps that are exchange-traded or are economically equivalent to exchange-traded swaps or futures contracts.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Certain deliverable currency forward contracts are subject to limited regulation in the U.S., including reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	In addition to the registration requirements described above, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	The CFTC may in the future also implement position limits for certain exempt commodity contracts, including metals and energy contracts, with respect to futures, options on futures, and economically equivalent swaps.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Position limits in spot months are proposed to be 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a non-spot month a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	If such position limits are adopted, they could materially affect the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Deliverable currency forward contracts are currently subject to only limited regulation in the United States.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets for the first time.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.
1469317_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Employees of the General Partner and its affiliates, perform all administrative services for the Partnership from offices located at 1200 Prospect Street, Suite 400, La Jolla, CA 92037.
1469317_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving Altegris Funds or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2014 the Partnership had 1,192 holders of Interests.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Altegris Funds has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and Altegris Funds has no present intention to make any.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2013:
1469317_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2013 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by J.P. Morgan Securities and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2013, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized losses of $4,630,395 from its trading of commodity futures contracts including brokerage commissions paid of $1,650,361.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $3,218,902, including $95,825 in incentive fees, $1,263,038 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,354,170 in service and professional fees.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $122,398 in interest income during 2013.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2013 is set forth below.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership was down slightly in October 2013.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gains made throughout the month in trading of futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices were offset by losses in every other sector.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Short positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European interest rates provided additional profit during the beginning of the month, but began generating losses as those markets surged later in the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	A long position in futures contracts on the S P profited as U.S. equities continued a nearly month-long rally, which reversed in the last few days of the month, eliminating most of the previous gains.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Partnership had significant losses in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices resulting from generally long positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	Other losses came from short positions in brent crude and gas oil, especially during the month s last four trading days.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	The Partnership achieved gains in November 2013, with long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and Japanese stock indices combining with long and short positions in futures contracts on interest rates to provide particularly robust returns.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S7	Positions in futures contracts on crude oil, currencies, and metals added to profits.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S8	Steady long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and Euro- Bund continued to add profit during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S9	Other winners for the month included short Yen positions, both sides of the Australian Dollar, and short positions in gold, silver, and crude oil.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S10	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2013 as profitable positions in futures contracts on stock indices and currencies combined with short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and metals to boost performance.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S11	Futures contracts on stock indices were the most significant driver of performance, exploiting a sustained rally in U.S. and European stock indices that began in the middle of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S12	Spanning the entire month, steady short signals in the U.S. 10-Year Note and Euro-Bund added further gains.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P10_S13	Short positions in futures contracts in the Japanese Yen, gold, and silver and long positions in futures contracts on the Euro also contributed to performance.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Partnership was nearly flat in July 2013 as the strength of short positions in U.S. Treasuries and long positions in energies, gold, and U.S. and European stock indices was offset by losses from short European interest rates, as well as poor positioning in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices and all currencies.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The primary driver of July performance was short futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries that delivered impressive month-long returns.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices and energies contributed further to profits as those markets rallied through month-end.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Positive performance was tempered by short positions in futures contracts on European interest rates, and a long Nikkei position.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2013 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices exploited a surge in U.S. equities.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S6	A long crude oil position delivered steady profits, which continued for practically the entire month as tensions in the Middle East bolstered prices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S7	A short position on futures contracts on U.S. equities provided a welcome offset to otherwise poor performance during the last few days of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in September 2013 with the bulk of the poor performance driven by futures contracts on U.S. stock indices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P11_S9	Gains from Nikkei, interest rates, and currencies provided only partial offset, while energies and metals contributed additional losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Partnership took a strong short position in futures contracts on the S P for the first half of the month, hampering performance as all U.S. stock indices trended higher.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Losses were compounded when the Partnership switched to a long position in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices just as the markets began to fall in the last week of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Long positions in crude oil and gold delivered further setbacks as both markets receded.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and the Euro compensated for some of the losses during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2013 as futures positions in equity indices, energies, and gold suffered disappointing reversals and dragged into negative territory.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	When the Bank of Japan announced a desire to double the monetary base within two years, a steady, month-long rally moved against short positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	A short S P signal proved profitable through the middle of the month, until a sustained rally delivered heavy losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Additional losses were averted by moving to long positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Also in April, Gold plunged on its biggest single day selloff, in percentage terms, since 1983.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Further losses were delivered by long positions in energies as those markets receded.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	The Partnership experienced a loss in May 2013 as strong returns in non-Japanese stock indices, non-Yen currencies, and energies were flattened by negative results in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices, Yen, U.S. Treasuries, and Gold.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	The Partnership had temporary relief and saw gains towards the end of May, but losses increased on long positions in futures contracts on stock indices against a lockstep global retreat.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	Further losses were added by short positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries and long signals in Gold.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in June 2013 when losing positions in futures contracts on currencies, energies, non-U.S. stock indices, and Gold eclipsed winning positions in interest rates and U.S. stock indices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S9	The Partnership suffered losses from short positions in Japanese and European stock indices, and unprofitable short positions in most currencies.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S10	After these losses, the Partnership realized temporary gains from short Japanese equities and a short position on futures contracts on the S P as U.S. equities dropped.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P14_S11	However, the end of the quarter delivered frustrating setbacks as short Japanese and U.S. equities, long Gold, and short currencies dragged performance into negative territory.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2013 as an equity rally that began in December continued into January causing losses in the Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	A corresponding long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund added to losses as that market fell.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The markets that contributed positively to performance were a long position on the Euro, and long positions in futures contracts on energies as those markets rose steadily.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2013 as short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and long positions on futures contracts on energies furnished losses that marginally exceeded gains from varied positions in contracts on stock indices and steady short signals in Gold and Silver.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	Early in the month, long positions in Yen, German interest rates, and U.S. Treasuries teamed with short positions across the Japanese stock indices to produce heavy losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	Later in the month, the Partnership suffered from the combined effects of long positions in the S P and short positions in Japanese stock indices, as both markets moved sharply opposite these signals.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	The Partnership experienced a loss in March 2013.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	Trading in futures contracts on interest rates and Japanese stock indices accounted for the bulk of the month s losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S8	U.S. and European stock indices delivered positive returns that slightly offset other losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S9	Trading futures contracts on the U.S. 10-Year Note generated the bulk of the losses in the portfolio for the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P15_S10	For the entire month, the Partnership maintained a short position in futures contracts on all Japanese stock indices that added to losses as the Nikkei surged upward.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	During 2012, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $9,028,017 from all trading; gains of $8,754,416 from trading of futures contracts including brokerage commissions paid of $1,916,974.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $7,804,749, including $4,320,095 in incentive fees, $1,454,056 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,503,361 in service and professional fees.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Partnership earned $146,654 in interest income during 2012.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2012 is set forth below.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2012 as losses in interest rates eclipsed modest gains in European equities, currencies, and energies.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The month started strong, with long equities and encouraging U.S. economic data delivering positive returns.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Performance eventually sagged, however, as long U.S. Treasury and European bond positions contravened market trends.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in November 2012 as performance was dominated by positions in futures contracts on the S P 500.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Long equity signals failed to anticipate heavy losses after the U.S. presidential election.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	These losses worsened when equity signals switched to short the following week just prior to an unexpected surge in these same markets.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Partnership achieved modest gains throughout the month in its trading of futures contracts on European bonds and the Japanese Yen, but not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2012 primarily through profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices on high volatility during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European equities, and short positions on U.S. Treasuries capitalized on a generally upward trend in stock markets during the first half of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	The second half of the month saw stock markets turn downward; however, by this time the Partnership s futures contracts on U.S equities positions had switched to short through the remainder of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	Performance during the month was also driven by gains on a long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund, as well as profits in currency futures trading.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2012 as poor employment numbers in the U.S. and continued concern about the fiscal health of Spain and Italy caused the equity markets to slide and treasury prices to rise, both working against the Partnership s positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Eurobund accounted for over half of the losses for the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Partnership also struggled in the stock index sector, with futures contracts on the S P being the worst performer.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Short positions in Crude Oil also hurt performance as prices spiked during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	Short positions in most of the foreign currencies contributed positively with a short Euro position being the best performer.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	The Partnership finished August 2012 with a slight gain.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S6	Long stock index futures positions drove performance during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S7	The month began negatively for stocks and treasuries, but the outlook changed with an unexpectedly positive U.S. employment report.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S8	Interest rates generated significant losses for the month, with a short Eurobund position in the second half of the month being the biggest loser.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S9	Crude oil prices rose steadily, contravening our mostly month-long short position.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S10	Currencies additionally dragged down returns as long positions in the Australian Dollar and Euro yielded losses.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S11	The Partnership ended September relatively flat with equity positions having delivered the bulk of the gains, offset by losses in interest rate positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P19_S12	Other notable contributors were profitable positions in futures contracts on energies, particularly Crude Oil, as well as lucrative positions in Gold and Copper.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Interest rate futures and currency futures hurt performance considerably.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in April 2012.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Partnership held long positions for the entire month in interest rate futures contracts, as poor March U.S. employment data and Spain s downgrade by S P drove interest rate futures higher.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The Partnership started the month short futures contracts on stock indices and reversed to a long position after the S P declined five consecutive days.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Partnership stayed with that long position for the rest of the month as the S P was able to recover most of its losses from earlier in the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Trading in currency, metal, energy and agricultural sectors all produced losses, but the Partnership s exposure in these sectors was less significant.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in May 2012, as poor U.S. employment data in the beginning of the month started equities on a downward slide.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices were well positioned to profit during the decline.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Partnership also benefitted from its long positions in the 10-year note and 30-year bond throughout the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	The most significant contributions to performance during the month came from trading in futures contracts on stock indices, interest rates and currencies.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in June 2012 based largely on long futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Equity markets rallied on the release of strong U.S. economic data.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Futures contracts on crude oil led the Partnership s energy sector trading.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Trading in futures contracts on currencies was the worst performing sector during the month as the dollar struggled during the first three weeks of the month, while the Partnership held short positions.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2012, with losses highly concentrated in the interest rate sector.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Positions in futures contracts on US Treasuries were the worst performing during the month, however, the Partnership also struggled with positions in futures contracts on the Euro currency, Euro-Bund and Dax.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Partnership earned gains in its trading of futures contracts on US equity indices, but it was not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2012 on poor trading in interest rate futures for the second consecutive month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Energy trading buoyed the month s performance with futures contracts on crude oil and brent crude representing the month s two best performing contracts as the Partnership took advantage of the long rally in oil prices.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in March 2012.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S6	During the first half of March, the positive economic data in the US drove interest rate futures down at a time when the Partnership was heavily short that sector.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S7	Subdued data from China, Europe and the US housing market also contributed to the rally in interest rate futures for the remainder of the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S8	While the Partnership lightened its exposure to US interest rates, positions in the European rates lead to losses in those markets.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P24_S9	The Partnership profited from its trading of futures contracts on the short side of the Yen and on the long side of E-mini S P contracts during the month.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	During 2011, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $4,717,099 from all trading: losses of $4,619,789 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions paid of $1,941,056.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $4,578,825, including $969,544 in incentive fees, $1,462,413 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $1,482,904 in service and professional fees.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The Partnership earned $266,259 in interest income during 2011.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2011 is set forth below.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in October 2011 as the program continued to benefit from turbulence in stock index and interest rate futures.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Equity markets rebounded strongly from their five-month free fall; however, markets began to sell off again at month-end.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Partnership profitably traded Euro-Bund futures contracts and took advantage of rising interest rates on the long end of the US yield curve.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	Trading in Euro futures continued to be strong as the currency gained in conjunction with renewed investor confidence.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	Crude oil futures also played a positive role in the month s final tally.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in November 2011 booking large gains on the first and last day of the month, and was profitable on five of the last six trading days of November.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S6	On the first of the month, when the program was largely short stock index futures and long interest rates, the Greek government called for a referendum on the latest bailout package causing the markets to fall and interest rate futures to rally sharply, producing large gains.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P26_S7	Euro-Bund and Dax futures were the most profitable contracts during the month, as the Partnership took advantage of continued volatility in Europe.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2011.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Trading in futures contracts on US Treasury notes and bonds proved challenging as news continued to fuel uncertainty regarding the European monetary union.
1469317_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Partnership also lost money in futures contracts on the Nasdaq and S P 500.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	The General Partner and Partners of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. (the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of income (loss), statements of changes in partners capital and financial highlights for each of the three years then ended.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P9_S1	These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1469317_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P10_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds) ("General Partner").
1469317_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and Futures Commission Merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P18_S2	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	Level 3 Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
1469317_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P31_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs which include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	U.S. government agency bonds and notes are categorized in Level I or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

1469317_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency denominated other assets and liabilities arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss) on futures contracts.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners capital.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Partnership pays brokerage commissions to the Clearing Broker for clearing trades on its behalf, which are reflected in the Statements of Income (Loss) as Brokerage Commissions.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Partnership pays to its Clearing Broker a monthly brokerage commission equal to the greater of: (1) actual brokerage commissions, which are based upon trading volume, or (2) a flat rate of 0.125% (1.5% annually) (the Minimum Amount ) of the Partnership s management fee net asset value.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	If actual brokerage commissions paid to the Clearing Broker are less than the Minimum Amount, the Partnership will pay to the introducing broker, the difference.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	However, if actual brokerage commissions are greater than the Minimum Amount, the Partnership only pays the actual brokerage commissions.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following presents the trading results of the Partnership s derivative trading and information related to the volume of the Partnership s derivative activity for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Income (Loss) for gain (loss) on trading derivatives contracts.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the number of futures contracts closed was 92,471.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the number of futures contracts closed was 150,019.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the number of futures contracts closed was 122,024.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	Effective January 1, 2013, the Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (the ASU, ASU 2011-11 ).
1469317_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	The amendments to this standard require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	With respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker to liquidate the Partnership s positions.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	These events include the following: (i) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership, (ii) failure to maintain initial margin or failure to make timely payment of additional variation margin, (iii) failure to pay the premium on any option purchased, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection of creditors against the Partnership, (v) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, or (vi) if the Partnership s registration status is suspended or is pending suspension.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The following table summarizes the disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities:
1469317_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P92_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P93_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P93_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P93_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	Total return and the ratios to average net asset value are calculated for each class of Limited Partners capital taken as a whole.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Total return is calculated on a monthly compounded basis.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	Management of the Partnership evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	General Partner of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.
1469317_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	I, Jon C. Sundt, the Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer of Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds), the General Partner of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.

1469317_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	General Partner of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. (the Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009 and commenced operations following an initial closing on October 1, 2009.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged in speculative trading across a broad range of futures contracts and currencies.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Partnership may in the future trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts (together with futures contracts and currencies, Commodity Interests ).

1469317_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	By operation of law and pursuant to Paragraph 17 of Partnership s First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, effective as of July 26, 2010, Advisors then assumed the general partner interest of Partnership previously held by APM.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	The officers of Advisors are the same persons with the same titles as the officers of APM prior to the Transaction, and the managers of Advisors were also the directors of APM prior to the Transaction.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The General Partner has sole responsibility for management and administration of all aspects of the Partnership s business.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Investors purchasing limited partnership interests (the Interests ) in the Partnership ( Limited Partners and together with the General Partner, Partners ) have no rights to participate in the management of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The General Partner is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) as a Commodity Pool Operator ( CPO ) and Commodity Trading Advisor ( CTA ), and is a member of National Futures Association ( NFA ).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Quantitative Investment Management LLC, a Virginia limited liability company formed in May 2003, acts as the Partnership s trading advisor ( QIM or the Advisor ).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	QIM became registered as a Commodity Trading Advisor ( CTA ) in 2004 and a CPO in 2005 and is a member of NFA.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Altegris Investments, LLC ( Altegris ), an affiliate of the General Partner, serves as a selling agent of the Interests and acted as the Partnership s introducing broker until January 1, 2011, when Altegris Futures LLC ( Altegris Futures ) replaced Altegris as the Partnership s introducing broker.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	On December 31, 2014, Altegris Futures merged with and into its affiliate, Altegris Clearing Solutions, LLC.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Altegris Clearing Solutions, LLC is registered with the CFTC as an Introducing Broker ( Clearing Solutions or the Introducing Broker ).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Partnership s term will end upon the first to occur of the following: receipt by the General Partner of an election to dissolve the Partnership at a specified time by Limited Partners owning more than 50% of the Interests then outstanding, notice of which is sent by registered mail to the General Partner not less than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of such dissolution; withdrawal, admitted or court decreed insolvency or dissolution of the General Partner unless at such time there is at least one remaining General Partner in the Partnership; or any event that makes it unlawful for the existence of the Partnership to be continued or requiring termination of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Partnership is not required to be, and is not, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of February 28, 2015, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $38,915,474.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership offers three classes of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a Class of Interest ).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors a broad range of tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	QIM will generally maintain an average margin to equity level of between 0% and 20%.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	It is expected that between 5% and 20% of the Partnership s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or U.S. Treasury Department ( Treasury ) securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker, SG Americas Securities, LLC ( SGAS ), a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	On January 2, 2015, Newedge USA, LLC ("Newedge USA") merged with and into SGAS, with the latter the surviving entity.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Interest on Partnership assets held at SGAS in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at SGAS could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	In December 2014, the Partnership made SGAS its primary clearing broker.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC ("JPMS") has been retained to serve as a reserve clearing broker for the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at SGAS as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances and commercial paper subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or SGAS, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	The General Partner receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	QIM receives a 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	J.P. Morgan Securities paid during 2014 to Altegris Futures (which in December 2014 merged with and into the Introducing Broker) a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to the General Partner equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, swap dealers , major swap participants and, in most cases, their respective associated persons, as well as floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as the General Partner, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as SGAS and introducing brokers such as the Introducing Broker to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	Similar position limits may in the future be put in place with respect to swaps that are exchange-traded or are economically equivalent to exchange-traded swaps or futures contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Certain deliverable currency forward contracts are subject to limited regulation in the United States, including reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	In addition to the registration requirements described above, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	The CFTC may in the future also implement position limits for certain exempt commodity contracts, including metals and energy contracts, with respect to futures, options on futures, and economically equivalent swaps.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	If such position limits are adopted, they could materially affect the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Deliverable currency forward contracts are currently subject to only limited regulation in the United States.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010, and gave the CFTC jurisdiction over non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses, and the CFTC may impose such a requirement on non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.
1469317_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Employees of the General Partner and its affiliates, perform all administrative services for the Partnership from offices located at 1200 Prospect Street, Suite 400, La Jolla, CA 92037.
1469317_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving the General Partner or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2015 the Partnership had 709 holders of Interests.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The General Partner has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and the General Partner has no present intention to make any.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2014:
1469317_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2014 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by SGAS and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2014, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized losses of $8,510,727 from all trading; losses of $8,523,461 from trading of commodity futures contracts including brokerage commissions of $949,065.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership incurred total expenses of $2,032,676, including $5,124 in incentive fees, $747,326 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $956,163 in service and professional fees.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $56,273 in interest income during 2014.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2014 with the bulk of the poor performance driven by short positions in futures contracts on the S P, Dax and DJ Euro Stoxx 50 stock indices.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	Other short positions in futures contracts on European interest rates contributed to the losses, although the losses were partially offset by gains from long positions in U.S. Treasury contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Short positions in the Dax (German stock index) and other European stock indices also hurt performance as the European markets rallied during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	Short positions in Euro partially offset the month s poor returns in Europe, as did profitable positions in the S P index due to long positions in future contracts for the second half of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in September 2014 driven by profitable positioning in European stock indices, currencies, energies and interest rates.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S6	Long positions in futures contracts on the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 and Dax indices and short positions in futures contracts on the Japanese Yen drove performance for the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S7	Short positions in futures contracts on the Euro-Bund, Australian Dollar, Brent Crude Oil and Gold contributed to performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P15_S8	Short positions in the U.S. 10-year Treasury Note was responsible for the month s only significant losses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April largely driven by positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices, US Treasuries, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	At the beginning of the month, long positions in futures contracts on US and European stock indices and US Treasuries added to performance, but early in the month US equities dropped resulting in a loss in the Partnership s long positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Later in the month, the Partnership entered into short positions on the indices, but the markets rallied resulting in a loss in the short positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	Mixed long and short positions in US Treasuries further detracted from the Partnership s performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	A long position in futures contracts on the Dax index adversely impacted the Partnership s performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S5	The Partnership experienced a loss in May as losses in single sector, stock indices, eclipsed gains in interest rates, currencies, metals and energies.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S6	The Partnership s long position in futures contracts on US Treasuries added to performance, while positions in futures contracts on the S P and the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 indices adversely impacted performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S7	The long position in Gilt further detracted from performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P16_S8	The Partnership s futures contracts on currencies, metals and energies contributed positively to performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in June driven by losses in interest rate contracts.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Long positions in futures on the S P index and crude oil contributed to performance, while short positions in gold futures and the Euro-Bund adversely impacted performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Partnership experienced a gain in January largely driven by positions in futures contracts on the Eurobund, U.S. and European stock indices and natural gas.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Long positions in futures contracts on the Eurobund and natural gas contributed to performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Performance also benefited from holding short positions in futures contracts on the S P index early in the month and then switching to long positions later in the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	Early in the month, long positions in futures contracts on the Dax and DJ Euro Stoxx 50 indices added to performance while later in the month short positions benefited performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The Partnership s performance was hurt by short positions in futures contracts on the U.S. 10-Year Note, but the positions losses were offset by gains in long futures positions in the U.S. Ultra Bond and 30-Year Bond.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P18_S9	Short positions in futures contracts on the S P and Dax indices were the largest detractors to performance during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in March driven by losses across all sectors.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Positions in futures contracts on the Dax and DJ Euro Stoxx 50 indices and on the Yen contributed to losses as the markets fluctuated generally inverse to the Partnership s positions.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2013 is set forth below.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Partnership was down slightly in October 2013.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Gains made throughout the month in trading of futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices were offset by losses in every other sector.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Short positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European interest rates provided additional profit during the beginning of the month, but began generating losses as those markets surged later in the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	A long position in futures contracts on the S P profited as U.S. equities continued a nearly month-long rally, which reversed in the last few days of the month, eliminating most of the previous gains.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	The Partnership had significant losses in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices resulting from generally long positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	Other losses came from short positions in brent crude and gas oil, especially during the month s last four trading days.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	The Partnership achieved gains in November 2013, with long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and Japanese stock indices combining with long and short positions in futures contracts on interest rates to provide particularly robust returns.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	Positions in futures contracts on crude oil, currencies, and metals added to profits.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S8	Steady long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and Euro- Bund continued to add profit during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S9	Other winners for the month included short Yen positions, both sides of the Australian Dollar, and short positions in gold, silver, and crude oil.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S10	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2013 as profitable positions in futures contracts on stock indices and currencies combined with short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and metals to boost performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S11	Futures contracts on stock indices were the most significant driver of performance, exploiting a sustained rally in U.S. and European stock indices that began in the middle of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S12	Spanning the entire month, steady short signals in the U.S. 10-Year Note and Euro-Bund added further gains.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P21_S13	Short positions in futures contracts in the Japanese Yen, gold, and silver and long positions in futures contracts on the Euro also contributed to performance.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Partnership was nearly flat in July 2013 as the strength of short positions in U.S. Treasuries and long positions in energies, gold, and U.S. and European stock indices was offset by losses from short European interest rates, as well as poor positioning in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices and all currencies.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The primary driver of July performance was short futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries that delivered impressive month-long returns.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices and energies contributed further to profits as those markets rallied through month-end.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	Positive performance was tempered by short positions in futures contracts on European interest rates, and a long Nikkei position.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2013 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices exploited a surge in U.S. equities.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	A long crude oil position delivered steady profits, which continued for practically the entire month as tensions in the Middle East bolstered prices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S7	A short position on futures contracts on U.S. equities provided a welcome offset to otherwise poor performance during the last few days of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in September 2013 with the bulk of the poor performance driven by futures contracts on U.S. stock indices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P22_S9	Gains from Nikkei, interest rates, and currencies provided only partial offset, while energies and metals contributed additional losses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Partnership took a strong short position in futures contracts on the S P for the first half of the month, hampering performance as all U.S. stock indices trended higher.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Losses were compounded when the Partnership switched to a long position in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices just as the markets began to fall in the last week of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Long positions in crude oil and gold delivered further setbacks as both markets receded.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and the Euro compensated for some of the losses during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2013 as futures positions in equity indices, energies, and gold suffered disappointing reversals and dragged into negative territory.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	When the Bank of Japan announced a desire to double the monetary base within two years, a steady, month-long rally moved against short positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	A short S P signal proved profitable through the middle of the month, until a sustained rally delivered heavy losses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Additional losses were averted by moving to long positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Also in April, Gold plunged on its biggest single day selloff, in percentage terms, since 1983.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	Further losses were delivered by long positions in energies as those markets receded.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	The Partnership experienced a loss in May 2013 as strong returns in non-Japanese stock indices, non-Yen currencies, and energies were flattened by negative results in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices, Yen, U.S. Treasuries, and Gold.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S6	The Partnership had temporary relief and saw gains towards the end of May, but losses increased on long positions in futures contracts on stock indices against a lockstep global retreat.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S7	Further losses were added by short positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries and long signals in Gold.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in June 2013 when losing positions in futures contracts on currencies, energies, non-U.S. stock indices, and Gold eclipsed winning positions in interest rates and U.S. stock indices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S9	The Partnership suffered losses from short positions in Japanese and European stock indices, and unprofitable short positions in most currencies.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S10	After these losses, the Partnership realized temporary gains from short Japanese equities and a short position on futures contracts on the S P as U.S. equities dropped.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P25_S11	However, the end of the quarter delivered frustrating setbacks as short Japanese and U.S. equities, long Gold, and short currencies dragged performance into negative territory.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2013 as an equity rally that began in December continued into January causing losses in the Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	A corresponding long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund added to losses as that market fell.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	The markets that contributed positively to performance were a long position on the Euro, and long positions in futures contracts on energies as those markets rose steadily.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2013 as short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and long positions on futures contracts on energies furnished losses that marginally exceeded gains from varied positions in contracts on stock indices and steady short signals in Gold and Silver.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	Early in the month, long positions in Yen, German interest rates, and U.S. Treasuries teamed with short positions across the Japanese stock indices to produce heavy losses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	Later in the month, the Partnership suffered from the combined effects of long positions in the S P and short positions in Japanese stock indices, as both markets moved sharply opposite these signals.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P26_S10	For the entire month, the Partnership maintained a short position in futures contracts on all Japanese stock indices that added to losses as the Nikkei surged upward.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2012 is set forth below.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in October 2012 as losses in interest rates eclipsed modest gains in European equities, currencies, and energies.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The month started strong, with long equities and encouraging U.S. economic data delivering positive returns.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	Performance eventually sagged, however, as long U.S. Treasury and European bond positions contravened market trends.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in November 2012 as performance was dominated by positions in futures contracts on the S P 500.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Long equity signals failed to anticipate heavy losses after the U.S. presidential election.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	These losses worsened when equity signals switched to short the following week just prior to an unexpected surge in these same markets.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Partnership achieved modest gains throughout the month in its trading of futures contracts on European bonds and the Japanese Yen, but not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2012 primarily through profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices on high volatility during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European equities, and short positions on U.S. Treasuries capitalized on a generally upward trend in stock markets during the first half of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	The second half of the month saw stock markets turn downward; however, by this time the Partnership s futures contracts on U.S equities positions had switched to short through the remainder of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P29_S6	Performance during the month was also driven by gains on a long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund, as well as profits in currency futures trading.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2012 as poor employment numbers in the U.S. and continued concern about the fiscal health of Spain and Italy caused the equity markets to slide and treasury prices to rise, both working against the Partnership s positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Eurobund accounted for over half of the losses for the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Partnership also struggled in the stock index sector, with futures contracts on the S P being the worst performer.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	Short positions in Crude Oil also hurt performance as prices spiked during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	Short positions in most of the foreign currencies contributed positively with a short Euro position being the best performer.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	The Partnership finished August 2012 with a slight gain.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S6	Long stock index futures positions drove performance during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S7	The month began negatively for stocks and treasuries, but the outlook changed with an unexpectedly positive U.S. employment report.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S8	Interest rates generated significant losses for the month, with a short Eurobund position in the second half of the month being the biggest loser.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S9	Crude oil prices rose steadily, contravening our mostly month-long short position.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S10	Currencies additionally dragged down returns as long positions in the Australian Dollar and Euro yielded losses.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S11	The Partnership ended September relatively flat with equity positions having delivered the bulk of the gains, offset by losses in interest rate positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P30_S12	Other notable contributors were profitable positions in futures contracts on energies, particularly Crude Oil, as well as lucrative positions in Gold and Copper.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest rate futures and currency futures hurt performance considerably.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in April 2012.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Partnership held long positions for the entire month in interest rate futures contracts, as poor March U.S. employment data and Spain s downgrade by S P drove interest rate futures higher.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Partnership started the month short futures contracts on stock indices and reversed to a long position after the S P declined five consecutive days.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The Partnership stayed with that long position for the rest of the month as the S P was able to recover most of its losses from earlier in the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	Trading in currency, metal, energy and agricultural sectors all produced losses, but the Partnership s exposure in these sectors was less significant.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in May 2012, as poor U.S. employment data in the beginning of the month started equities on a downward slide.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices were well positioned to profit during the decline.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The Partnership also benefitted from its long positions in the 10-year note and 30-year bond throughout the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	The most significant contributions to performance during the month came from trading in futures contracts on stock indices, interest rates and currencies.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in June 2012 based largely on long futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Equity markets rallied on the release of strong U.S. economic data.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Futures contracts on crude oil led the Partnership s energy sector trading.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	Trading in futures contracts on currencies was the worst performing sector during the month as the dollar struggled during the first three weeks of the month, while the Partnership held short positions.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2012, with losses highly concentrated in the interest rate sector.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Positions in futures contracts on US Treasuries were the worst performing during the month, however, the Partnership also struggled with positions in futures contracts on the Euro currency, Euro-Bund and Dax.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Partnership earned gains in its trading of futures contracts on US equity indices, but it was not enough to offset losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2012 on poor trading in interest rate futures for the second consecutive month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	Energy trading buoyed the month s performance with futures contracts on crude oil and brent crude representing the month s two best performing contracts as the Partnership took advantage of the long rally in oil prices.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	The Partnership achieved a gain in March 2012.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	During the first half of March, the positive economic data in the US drove interest rate futures down at a time when the Partnership was heavily short that sector.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	Subdued data from China, Europe and the US housing market also contributed to the rally in interest rate futures for the remainder of the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S8	While the Partnership lightened its exposure to US interest rates, positions in the European rates lead to losses in those markets.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P35_S9	The Partnership profited from its trading of futures contracts on the short side of the Yen and on the long side of E-mini S P contracts during the month.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The General Partner believes that the Partnership s most critical accounting estimates relate to the valuation of the Partnership s assets.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) which require the use of certain estimates made by the Partnership s management.

1469317_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, the General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are appropriate and reasonable, however actual results could differ from these estimates.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	The estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment.
1469317_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership s critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported.

(the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of income (loss), statements of changes in partners capital and financial highlights for each of the three years then ended.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P10_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P10_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P11_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds) ("General Partner").
1469317_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and futures commission merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	On December 31, 2014, pursuant to that certain General Partner Admission Agreement dated as of December 30, 2014 among Altegris Advisors, L.L.C. ( Advisors or the General Partner ), Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. ( APM ) and the Partnership, Advisors, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of APM, was admitted as a general partner of the Partnership effective immediately prior to the Transaction (defined below).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	Pursuant to an internal reorganization of APM, then a general partner of Partnership, and certain affiliated entities, APM merged with and into Advisors on December 31, 2014 (the Transaction ).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P18_S2	By operation of law Advisors then assumed the general partner interest of Partnership previously held by APM.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P18_S3	The officers of Advisors are the same persons with the same titles as the officers of APM prior to the Transaction, and the managers of Advisors were also the directors of APM prior to the Transaction.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	Therefore, the Partnership follows the accounting and reporting guidelines for investment companies.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Level 3 Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P28_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs which include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	U.S. government agency bonds and notes are categorized in Level I or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013:
1469317_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	"Financial Derivative Instruments" for the fair value in each type of contracts within this category.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no Level 3 securities.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Income (Loss).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Brokerage commissions on futures contracts include other trading fees and are incurred as an expense when contracts are opened, and are recognized as trading gains and losses.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Net realized gains and losses from foreign currency related transactions represent gains and losses from sales of foreign currencies, sales and maturities of futures contracts in foreign markets, currency gains and losses realized between trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Partnership s books and the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency denominated other assets and liabilities arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Partnership may engage in futures contracts as part of its investment strategy.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss) on futures contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Due to broker amounts on the Statement of Financial Condition represent the amount of any short fall in the Fund's required cash margin.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P61_S2	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners capital.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Partnership pays brokerage commissions to the Clearing Broker for clearing trades on its behalf, which are reflected in the Statements of Income (Loss) as Brokerage Commissions.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Partnership pays to its Clearing Broker a monthly brokerage commission equal to the greater of: (1) actual brokerage commissions, which are based upon trading volume, or (2) a flat rate of 0.125% (1.5% annually) (the Minimum Amount ) of the Partnership s management fee net asset value.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	If actual brokerage commissions paid to the Clearing Broker are less than the Minimum Amount, the Partnership will pay to the introducing broker, the difference.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	However, if actual brokerage commissions are greater than the Minimum Amount, the Partnership only pays the actual brokerage commissions.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P87_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Income (Loss) for gain (loss) on trading derivatives contracts.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the number of futures contracts closed was 58,163.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the number of futures contracts closed was 92,471.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the number of futures contracts closed was 150,019.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	With respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker to liquidate the Partnership s positions.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	These events include the following: (i) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership, (ii) failure to maintain initial margin or failure to make timely payment of additional variation margin, (iii) failure to pay the premium on any option purchased, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection of creditors against the Partnership, (v) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, or (vi) if the Partnership s registration status is suspended or is pending suspension.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities:
1469317_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	(1) Does not include maintenance margin deposits held at the Clearing Broker of $1,966,135 for 2014 $2,460,129 for 2013, respectively.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P96_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P96_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P97_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P97_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

1469317_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.

1469317_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes i.e. , a speculative commodity pool.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors a broad range of tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	QIM will generally maintain an average margin to equity level of between 0% and 20%.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	It is expected that between 5% and 20% of the Partnership s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or U.S. Treasury Department ( Treasury ) securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker, SG Americas Securities LLC ( SGAS ), a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at SGAS in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at SGAS could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at SGAS as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances and commercial paper subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or SGAS, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	The General Partner receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	QIM receives 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling agent (0.50% per annum).
1469317_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	SGAS paid, during 2015, to the Introducing Broker a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, of which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	A round-turn is both the purchase, or sale, of a commodity interest contract and the subsequent offsetting sale, or purchase, of the contract.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.

1469317_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as the General Partner, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as SGAS, and introducing brokers such as the Introducing Broker to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	Similar position limits may in the future be put in place with respect to swaps that are exchange-traded or are economically equivalent to exchange-traded swaps or futures contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Certain deliverable currency forward contracts are subject to limited regulation in the United States, including reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to the registration requirements described above, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	The CFTC may in the future also implement position limits for certain exempt commodity contracts, including metals and energy contracts, with respect to futures, options on futures, and economically equivalent swaps.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	If such position limits are adopted, they could materially affect the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Deliverable currency forward contracts are currently subject to only limited regulation in the United States.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010, and gave the CFTC jurisdiction over non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses, and the CFTC may impose such a requirement on non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.

1469317_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving the General Partner or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 29, 2016 the Partnership had 411 holders of Interests.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The General Partner has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and the General Partner has no present intention to make any.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2015:
1469317_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2015 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by SGAS and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2015, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $5,304,330 from all trading; gains of $5,305,807 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $437,363.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $1,284,305, including $68,417 in incentive fees, $358,619 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $595,555 in service and professional fees.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $27,968 in interest income during 2015.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Partnership s position in interest rate futures detracted from performance.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The majority of the losses in interest rate futures occurred in the last three days of the month, nearly erasing all of the Partnership s profits for the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The losses were partially offset by a short position in the Euro.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Partnership experienced a gain in November 2015 driven by gains across all sectors- stock indices, interest rates, currencies, metals, and energy.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	At the beginning of the month, the Partnership benefitted from short positions in interest rate and foreign currencies since a better than expected October nonfarm payroll number accompanied by hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve caused a significant selloff in interest rate futures and a rally in the U.S. Dollar.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	As a result, at the beginning of the month the Partnership experienced gains from trading in interest rate futures contracts and foreign currency contracts, other than the Italian Government Bond.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S8	The Partnership also benefited during the month from short futures positions in metal and energy sectors as global economic weakness pushed commodity prices lower throughout the month.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S10	The month got off to a rough start when the European Central Bank announced on December 3 rd a rate cut and an extension of its asset purchase program, which did not meet market expectations.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S11	The Partnership s long futures positions in European interest rates and short futures positions in currencies performed poorly as those markets corrected.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S12	A weaker U.S. Dollar and multi-year lows in the crude oil market put pressure on U.S. and European equity markets, which culminated in a sharp selloff in global equity markets on December 11 th .
1469317_16_ITEM7_P11_S13	In connection with the selloff, the Partnership sustained substantial losses due to net long positions in stock indices and energies.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	The Partnership experienced a gain in September 2015 with the bulk of the positive performance coming from short positions in futures on stock indices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	At the beginning of the month, the PBOC announced more stringent capital controls resulting in a 10% drop in the price of crude oil.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Partnership was well positioned in advance of the PBOC announcement by having short positions in crude oil contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Currencies were the only sector with negative performance during the month, and the Partnership s positions in currencies detracted from performance.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	Performance was adversely impacted by long positions in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices and positions in the Euro.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P28_S6	The Partnership experienced a slight gain in February largely driven by long positions in futures contracts on natural gas and on interest rates.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P28_S7	Long positions on futures in Eurobund, Euro-Bobl and U.S. Treasuries and on the S P index contributed positively to performance.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P28_S9	Short positions in futures contracts on the S P and Dax indices were the largest detractors to performance during the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in March driven by losses across all sectors.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Partnership was down slightly in October 2013.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Gains made throughout the month in trading of futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices were offset by losses in every other sector.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Short positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European interest rates provided additional profit during the beginning of the month, but began generating losses as those markets surged later in the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	A long position in futures contracts on the S P profited as U.S. equities continued a nearly month-long rally, which reversed in the last few days of the month, eliminating most of the previous gains.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	The Partnership had significant losses in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices resulting from generally long positions.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Other losses came from short positions in brent crude and gas oil, especially during the month s last four trading days.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	The Partnership achieved gains in November 2013, with long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and Japanese stock indices combining with long and short positions in futures contracts on interest rates to provide particularly robust returns.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S7	Positions in futures contracts on crude oil, currencies, and metals added to profits.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S8	Steady long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and Euro- Bund continued to add profit during the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S9	Other winners for the month included short Yen positions, both sides of the Australian Dollar, and short positions in gold, silver, and crude oil.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S10	The Partnership achieved gains in December 2013 as profitable positions in futures contracts on stock indices and currencies combined with short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and metals to boost performance.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S11	Futures contracts on stock indices were the most significant driver of performance, exploiting a sustained rally in U.S. and European stock indices that began in the middle of the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S12	Spanning the entire month, steady short signals in the U.S. 10-Year Note and Euro-Bund added further gains.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P31_S13	Short positions in futures contracts in the Japanese Yen, gold, and silver and long positions in futures contracts on the Euro also contributed to performance.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Partnership was nearly flat in July 2013 as the strength of short positions in U.S. Treasuries and long positions in energies, gold, and U.S. and European stock indices was offset by losses from short European interest rates, as well as poor positioning in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices and all currencies.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The primary driver of July performance was short futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries that delivered impressive month-long returns.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices and energies contributed further to profits as those markets rallied through month-end.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Positive performance was tempered by short positions in futures contracts on European interest rates, and a long Nikkei position.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2013 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on interest rates and stock indices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Long positions in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices exploited a surge in U.S. equities.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	A long crude oil position delivered steady profits, which continued for practically the entire month as tensions in the Middle East bolstered prices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S7	A short position on futures contracts on U.S. equities provided a welcome offset to otherwise poor performance during the last few days of the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in September 2013 with the bulk of the poor performance driven by futures contracts on U.S. stock indices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P32_S9	Gains from Nikkei, interest rates, and currencies provided only partial offset, while energies and metals contributed additional losses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Partnership took a strong short position in futures contracts on the S P for the first half of the month, hampering performance as all U.S. stock indices trended higher.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Losses were compounded when the Partnership switched to a long position in futures contracts on U.S. stock indices just as the markets began to fall in the last week of the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Long positions in crude oil and gold delivered further setbacks as both markets receded.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Long positions in futures contracts on the Nikkei and the Euro compensated for some of the losses during the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2013 as futures positions in equity indices, energies, and gold suffered disappointing reversals and dragged into negative territory.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	When the Bank of Japan announced a desire to double the monetary base within two years, a steady, month-long rally moved against short positions.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	A short S P signal proved profitable through the middle of the month, until a sustained rally delivered heavy losses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Additional losses were averted by moving to long positions.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Also in April, Gold plunged on its biggest single day selloff, in percentage terms, since 1983.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Further losses were delivered by long positions in energies as those markets receded.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	The Partnership experienced a loss in May 2013 as strong returns in non-Japanese stock indices, non-Yen currencies, and energies were flattened by negative results in futures contracts on Japanese stock indices, Yen, U.S. Treasuries, and Gold.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S6	The Partnership had temporary relief and saw gains towards the end of May, but losses increased on long positions in futures contracts on stock indices against a lockstep global retreat.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S7	Further losses were added by short positions in futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries and long signals in Gold.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S8	The Partnership experienced a loss in June 2013 when losing positions in futures contracts on currencies, energies, non-U.S. stock indices, and Gold eclipsed winning positions in interest rates and U.S. stock indices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S9	The Partnership suffered losses from short positions in Japanese and European stock indices, and unprofitable short positions in most currencies.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S10	After these losses, the Partnership realized temporary gains from short Japanese equities and a short position on futures contracts on the S P as U.S. equities dropped.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P35_S11	However, the end of the quarter delivered frustrating setbacks as short Japanese and U.S. equities, long Gold, and short currencies dragged performance into negative territory.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2013 as an equity rally that began in December continued into January causing losses in the Partnership s short positions in futures contracts on stock indices.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	A corresponding long position in futures contracts on the Eurobund added to losses as that market fell.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The markets that contributed positively to performance were a long position on the Euro, and long positions in futures contracts on energies as those markets rose steadily.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	The Partnership experienced a loss in February 2013 as short positions in futures contracts on interest rates and long positions on futures contracts on energies furnished losses that marginally exceeded gains from varied positions in contracts on stock indices and steady short signals in Gold and Silver.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	Early in the month, long positions in Yen, German interest rates, and U.S. Treasuries teamed with short positions across the Japanese stock indices to produce heavy losses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	Later in the month, the Partnership suffered from the combined effects of long positions in the S P and short positions in Japanese stock indices, as both markets moved sharply opposite these signals.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	The Partnership experienced a loss in March 2013.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	Trading in futures contracts on interest rates and Japanese stock indices accounted for the bulk of the month s losses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	U.S. and European stock indices delivered positive returns that slightly offset other losses.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S9	Trading futures contracts on the U.S. 10-Year Note generated the bulk of the losses in the portfolio for the month.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P36_S10	For the entire month, the Partnership maintained a short position in futures contracts on all Japanese stock indices that added to losses as the Nikkei surged upward.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The General Partner believes that the Partnership s most critical accounting estimates relate to the valuation of the Partnership s assets.

1469317_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	The estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment.
1469317_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership s critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	The General Partner and Partners of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. (the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income (loss), statements of changes in partners capital and financial highlights for each of the three years then ended.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P11_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P12_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P12_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P12_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations, the changes in its partners capital and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Advisors, L.L.C. ("General Partner").
1469317_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and futures commission merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	Therefore, the Partnership follows the accounting and reporting guidelines for investment companies.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Level 3 Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P29_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs which include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	U.S. government agency bonds and notes are categorized in Level I or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:
1469317_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	"Financial Derivative Instruments" for the fair value in each type of contracts within this category.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no Level 3 securities.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Security transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial reporting purposes.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Realized gains and losses from security transactions are determined using the specific identification cost method.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Gains or losses on futures contracts are realized when contracts are closed.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Net unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and quoted market price) are reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Income (Loss).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Brokerage commissions on futures contracts include other trading fees and are incurred as an expense when contracts are opened, and are recognized as trading gains and losses.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Net realized gains and losses from foreign currency related transactions represent gains and losses from sales of foreign currencies, sales and maturities of futures contracts in foreign markets, currency gains and losses realized between trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Partnership s books and the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency denominated other assets and liabilities arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Northern Trust Company (the Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Partnership has cash deposited with the Custodian.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	SG Americas Securities, LLC (the Clearing Broker ) is the Partnership s commodity broker.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P51_S3	For cash not held with the Clearing Broker the Partnership receives cash management services from J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Partnership engages in futures contracts as part of its investment strategy.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss) on futures contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Due to broker amounts on the Statements of Financial Condition represent the amount of any short fall in the Partnership s required cash margin.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Partnership recording a tax liability that reduces ending partners capital.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	Based on its analysis, the Partnership has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P64_S3	However, the Partnership s conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Income (Loss) for gain (loss) on trading derivatives contracts.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the number of futures contracts closed was 31,490.

1469317_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	With respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker to liquidate the Partnership s positions.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	These events include the following: (i) the Clearing Broker is directed or required by a regulatory or self-regulatory organization, (ii) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, (iii) upon the Partnership s breach or failure to perform on its contractual agreements with the Clearing Broker, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection of creditors against the Partnership, or (v) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following table summarizes the disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities:
1469317_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P99_S3	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P102_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

1469317_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	Financial information regarding the Partnership s business is set forth in the Partnership s financial statements, included herewith.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership s objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	QIM believes that financial markets are not entirely efficient and that numerous small inefficiencies exist and can be exploited through the prudent use of robust analysis and predictive technologies.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	QIM currently employs several thousand quantitative trading models that utilize pattern recognition to predict short-term price movements in global futures markets.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	All models are tested across large data sets that expose them to a wide range of market, economic, and political environments, as well as a wide range of time frames and interactions.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	The resultant system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	QIM s trading strategies and models may be revised from time to time as a result of ongoing research and development seeking to devise new strategies and systems as well as to improve current methods.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	The strategies and systems used by QIM in the future may differ significantly from those currently in use due to changes resulting from this research, and Limited Partners will not be informed of these changes as they may occur.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	QIM applies risk management procedures that take into account the price, size, volatility, liquidity, and inter-relationships of the contracts traded.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Partnership s positions are generally balanced in a manner that allocates approximately equal amounts of measured risk to as many distinct markets as possible and during significant drawdowns in equity, QIM will reduce market exposure by scaling back the Partnership s overall leverage.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	QIM s trading is generally approximately 95% systematic and 5% discretionary.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	All facets of the predictive models, risk management, and trade allocation are fully automated or proceduralized.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	In this sense, the trading is systematic.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Discretion of QIM, however, plays a significant role in the pursuit of improvements to the Program.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	QIM has different time horizons for the execution of certain trades.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	For example, QIM may have certain trades executed at the beginning of the trading day while giving the executing broker limited discretion with respect to other trades.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	QIM currently trades or monitors a broad range of tradable markets in currencies, stock indices, interest rates, energy, grains, softs and metals.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	QIM may add or delete markets from this universe of tradable markets in its discretion if QIM s research demonstrates that such an addition or deletion would enhance the program s performance.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	All markets are futures markets or interbank currency markets.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	QIM seeks to profitably trade each of these markets while taking advantage of the diversification available from such a varied universe of futures contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	QIM s trading program often takes opposing long and short positions within the same or related classes of correlated futures, which, taken in conjunction with the effect of diversification across a broad range of contracts, generally results in reduced market exposure than trading a single market with similar leverage.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	A substantial portion of the equity in the Partnership s account is invested in United States ( U.S. ) government and agency securities and other liquid, high-quality instruments at the direction of the Custodian (as defined below).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	QIM will generally maintain an average margin to equity level of between 0% and 20%.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	The actual percentage of assets committed to margin at any time may be higher or lower than the target level.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	It is expected that between 5% and 20% of the Partnership s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or U.S. Treasury Department ( Treasury ) securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker, SG Americas Securities LLC ( SGAS ), a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), and available for trading by QIM in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Interest on Partnership assets held at SGAS in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at SGAS could change significantly, and all of the Partnership s assets are available for use as margin.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by QIM.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	With respect to Partnership assets not held at SGAS as described above, but deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its affiliate J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. ( JPMIM ).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Partnership s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker s acceptances and commercial paper subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P22_S3	The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The percentage of the Partnership s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner s sole discretion.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Partnership s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	Depositing the Partnership s assets with banks or SGAS, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	The General Partner receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the management fee net asset value ), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	QIM receives 30% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling agent (0.50% per annum).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	SGAS paid, during 2016, to the Introducing Broker a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership s assets.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	A round-turn is both the purchase, or sale, of a commodity interest contract and the subsequent offsetting sale, or purchase, of the contract.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	In any month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to the General Partner equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).
1469317_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, swap dealers, major swap participants and, in most cases, their respective associated persons, as well as floor brokers and floor traders.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as the General Partner, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as SGAS and introducing brokers such as the Introducing Broker to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	Similar position limits may in the future be put in place with respect to swaps that are exchange-traded or are economically equivalent to exchange-traded swaps or futures contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Certain deliverable currency forward contracts are subject to limited regulation in the United States, including reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to the registration requirements described above, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	The CFTC may in the future also implement position limits for certain exempt commodity contracts, including metals and energy contracts, with respect to futures, options on futures, and economically equivalent swaps.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	If such position limits are adopted, they could materially affect the Partnership s trading strategy.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Deliverable currency forward contracts are currently subject to only limited regulation in the United States.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act ) was enacted in July 2010, and gave the CFTC jurisdiction over non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses, and the CFTC may impose such a requirement on non-deliverable currency forward contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.
1469317_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
1469317_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business.
1469317_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Employees of the General Partner and its affiliates perform all administrative services for the Partnership from offices located at 1200 Prospect Street, Suite 400, La Jolla, CA 92037.
1469317_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject.
1469317_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Partnership is not aware of any material legal proceedings involving the General Partner or its principals in an adverse position to the Partnership or in which the Partnership has adverse interests.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Interests may be redeemed or transferred subject to the conditions imposed by the Limited Partnership Agreement.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2017 the Partnership had 426 holders of Interests.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	The General Partner has sole discretion in determining what distributions, if any, the Partnership will make to its investors.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	To date no distributions or dividends have been paid on the Interests, and the General Partner has no present intention to make any.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016:
1469317_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2016 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by SGAS and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2016, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $5,596,747 from all trading; gains of $5,583,800 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $409,189.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $2,217,157, including $1,106,228 in incentive fees, $333,163 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $581,718 in service and professional fees.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $46,173 in interest income during 2016.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2016 is set forth below.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership was down for the month of October 2016.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Underperformance was driven by stock indices, while the most profitable sector was currencies, followed by metals.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Early in the month, long stock index and interest rate positions suffered as markets digested hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve, a rising dollar and continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Partnership remained net long as stock indices recovered, only to sell off again in the last week of trading when the focus on the election intensified.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Short positions in interest rate futures acquired mid-month did offset some of those losses as bonds traded to their lowest level in four months.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	The U.S. Dollar strengthened throughout the month, benefiting the Partnership s short currency positions.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	The bulk of profits in the metals sector were attributed to a short position in gold, for which prices collapsed early in the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	The Partnership had overall positive returns for the month of November, 2016, with performance driven by stock indices, while metals were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	The Partnership began the month with significant long U.S. stock index positions.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S7	Initially, markets traded lower ahead of uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election, and post-election, stock markets sold off dramatically only to rebound and close higher by the end of the following trading day.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S8	The Partnership remained long while indices climbed higher through the end of the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S9	A long gold position acquired midmonth was the primary driver for losses in the metals sector with that market trading to nine-month lows on continued strength in the equity markets.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S10	In the energies sector, the Partnership sustained losses on short crude oil positions as markets moved higher on speculation that OPEC was nearing an agreement for production cuts.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P12_S11	The Partnership was up for the month of December 2016.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The most profitable sectors were stock indices, followed by interest rates.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The only sector with negative performance was metals.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Early in the month, long stock index positions suffered as equity prices traded lower on concerns that the postelection rally was overdone and questions about the trade policy of the incoming administration.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, the Partnership increased its long exposure to the sector and profited as markets reversed later in the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Long interest rate positions were a steady drag on performance until mid-month, but after an interest rate announcement on December 15, 2016, interest rate futures crept higher for the remainder of the month, pushing the sector into profitable territory in the second half of the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Strength in equity markets and trade policy concerns led to general weakness in prices for the metals sector.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Partnership held long positions in all metals contracts for the entire month, resulting in underperformance for the month..
1469317_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Partnership was mixed for the month of July 2016, ending the month flat to slightly negative.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The only profitable sector was stock indices.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Returns initially had a strong start with long U.S. and short European stock index positions but lingering concerns over the impact of Brexit weighed on European indices, while U.S. indices outperformed on the back of a surprisingly strong nonfarm payroll number on July 8th.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Performance in stock indices remained strong throughout the month; however, losses in long interest rate positions offset much of these gains as bonds moved higher on the increased probability of rate hikes.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Partnership remained net long stock indices but reversed into short interest rate futures in anticipation of an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	As expected, rates were left unchanged and, despite a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, stocks and bonds both traded higher with losses in interest rate futures offsetting gains in stock indices.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	Thereafter, focus shifted to the Bank of Japan meeting, which disappointed markets with a less accommodative monetary and fiscal policy than had been expected.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	The Yen surged higher and the Partnership s short Yen position eroded much of the overall gains going into month end.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	In August 2016, the Partnership experienced positive overall performance with the most profitable sector being interest rates, followed closely by stock indices.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	Metals were slightly positive, while the currency and energy sectors were both negative.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S8	The Partnership initially profited as with net long stock index and short interest rate positions, as the S P and Nasdaq soared to record highs, and then reversed into short stock indices in the middle of the month as equity markets became increasingly choppy.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S9	Despite a decidedly hawkish tone by the Federal Reserve at an August 2016 meeting, equity markets traded higher into month end, paring gains in the stock index sector.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S10	Losses in the currency sector early in the month were attributed to a short Yen position that declined when the Bank of Japan announced stimulus measures that did not include further monetary easing.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S11	By month end, the Partnership had reversed into long currency positions and suffered additional losses as the U.S. Dollar surged.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S12	In September 2016, the Partnership experienced solid profits as the main driver of performance was stock indices, whereas the worst performing sector was currencies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S13	The Partnership came into the month short global equity indices and achieved mixed results through the first week of trading.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S14	Between September 9th 10th, signals in equity indices reversed as global stock markets sold off dramatically on the 9th and rallied back on the 10th.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S15	The Partnership earned significant profits on both sides of the trade, and returns remained long going into the September Federal Reserve, which spurred a two-day rally in U.S. equity markets.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S16	The Partnership then gave back a portion of gains as markets became increasingly choppy going into month end.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S17	Currency losses accrued early in the month and were primarily attributable to short Euro positions as a hawkish European Central Bank meeting sent the currency sharply higher.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P18_S18	The bulk of the losses in energies came in the last week of trading when short crude positions suffered on the news that OPEC had reached a preliminary agreement on the first production cuts in eight years.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Partnership was flat to slightly negative for the month of April 2016.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Currencies were the most profitable sector, followed by stock indices and metals.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Partnership came into the month short all stock index contracts, making substantial profits in the first week of trading as equity markets traded lower.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	As the month wore on, equity markets recovered on the back of a marginally positive earnings season domestically and the lack of any significant negative headlines internationally.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	The Partnership maintained a net short position as markets trended higher, erasing earlier profits and going negative in the sector until equity markets began to falter late in the month on disappointing news from the Bank of Japan as to its leaving rates unchanged and failing to increase stimulus.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S5	This sent equity markets sharply lower and the Yen skyrocketed to new multi-year highs resulting in gains for the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S6	While bonds moved lower on equity strength, the possibility of a June rate hike from the FOMC limited the upside as equities sold off.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S7	The Partnership experienced profits in May 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates and currencies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S8	Following a late April FOMC statement that lowered the likelihood for a June 2016 rate hike, concerns regarding the global economy were further heightened in the first week of May by weak Caixin PMI data in China and disappointing nonfarm payroll numbers in the United States.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S9	These events caused a flight to quality during early in the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P20_S10	During this period, the Partnership traded the Euro-Bund, U.S. 30-Year Bond, Long Gilt, S P and Hang Seng futures contracts to secure gains in the interest rates and stock indices sectors.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	As the month progressed, a shift in the Federal Reserve s tone indicated a likely rate hike due to an improving economy, and coupled with substantial short covering and reports of a surge in U.S. new home sales, a strong rally in equity indices and commodities ensued (offset by a decline in global interest rate futures).
1469317_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The second half of May saw the Partnership benefitting from long positions in U.S. equity indices, while it suffered from short positions in European equity indices and long positions across U.S. Treasuries.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Partnership was up slightly for the month of June 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	The only negative sector was currencies.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Volatility across global financial markets was largely driven by expectations and reactions around the FOMC decision to hold on an interest rate hike and the U.K. referendum vote.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	With the uncertainty of an interest rate hike removed, attention became squarely focused on the outcome of Brexit vote.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	As resultant volatility ensued, the Partnership benefitted from positions in the DJ Euro Stoxx 50, Dax, U.S. 30-Year Bond and Gold, and risk exposure leading up to the Brexit vote was reduced.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Partnership suffered losses during the days preceding the Brexit vote but recouped most of those losses as markets reacted sharply to the surprising decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Over the last three days of June 2016, the Partnership gave back profits in the stock indices sector as global equity markets rallied.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Partnership experienced net gains for the month of January 2016, with interest rates contributing most of the profits, followed by stock indices; whereas on the negative side, energies were the worst performing sector, followed by currency positions that also suffered declines in the period.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Partnership maintained short positions in U.S. European stock indices and long positions in interest rates throughout January resulting in strong returns early in the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Partnership initially posted modest gains from short crude oil positions before reversing into substantial long positions thereafter.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	After a temporary rally, the price of crude oil resumed its downward trend, causing the long positions to sustain losses by month-end.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	The Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy near month-end, with equity markets trading higher while the Yen dropped sharply costing the Partnership a significant portion of the gains it had made earlier in the month.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S5	The Partnership enjoyed solid net positive performance for the month of February 2016, led by gains in stock indices, followed by positive returns in the interest rates, energies and currencies sectors.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P26_S6	The only negative sector for the month was metals.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Short positions in crude oil and stock indices benefitted from global growth early in the period.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Upon reversing the shorts into longs mid-month, the Partnership s positions in stock indices and crude oil profited due to positive economic data and rallying markets, followed by the Partnership reversing again to shorts allowing it to eke out marginal additional gains as equity markets remained choppy through month-end.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	A long position in Yen held throughout the month of February was responsible for most of the profits that month in the currencies sector.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	The Partnership s losses in the metals sector for the period were attributed to a short Gold position as that market trended higher.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	The Partnership sustained a net loss for the month of March 2016, with stock indices being the worst-performing sector, and currencies, interest rates and energies each experiencing slightly negative returns.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	The only positive sector was metals for the period.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S6	Losses were sustained in short stock index positions and long interest rate positions were due to strong economic data coupled with dovish statements from the Federal Reserve leading to the perception that, despite improving economic conditions, a rate hike was unlikely in March.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S7	Short positions in currencies and energies added to losses as the U.S. Dollar surged and commodity prices moved higher throughout the period.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P27_S8	The metals sector was the only bright spot in March, as the Partnership began the month short metals, then reversed mid-month into long positions, making back earlier losses and posting moderate gains as Gold rose on continued bullish sentiment.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	During 2015, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $5,304,330 from all trading; gains of $5,305,807 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $437,363.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Partnership accrued total expenses of $1,284,305, including $68,417 in incentive fees, $358,619 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $595,555 in service and professional fees.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Partnership also achieved gains in its trading of crude oil contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Partnership s position in interest rate futures detracted from performance.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The majority of the losses in interest rate futures occurred in the last three days of the month, nearly erasing all of the Partnership s profits for the month.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Partnership experienced a gain in November 2015 driven by gains across all sectors- stock indices, interest rates, currencies, metals, and energy.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	At the beginning of the month, the Partnership benefitted from short positions in interest rate and foreign currencies since a better than expected October nonfarm payroll number accompanied by hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve caused a significant selloff in interest rate futures and a rally in the U.S. Dollar.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S8	The Partnership also benefited during the month from short futures positions in metal and energy sectors as global economic weakness pushed commodity prices lower throughout the month.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S10	The month got off to a rough start when the European Central Bank announced on December 3rd a rate cut and an extension of its asset purchase program, which did not meet market expectations.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S11	The Partnership s long futures positions in European interest rates and short futures positions in currencies performed poorly as those markets corrected.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S12	A weaker U.S. Dollar and multi-year lows in the crude oil market put pressure on U.S. and European equity markets, which culminated in a sharp selloff in global equity markets on December 11th.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P30_S13	In connection with the selloff, the Partnership sustained substantial losses due to net long positions in stock indices and energies.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Partnership achieved a gain in August 2015 driven by profitable positioning in futures contracts on U.S. and European stock indices.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	On August 11th the PBOC unexpectedly began to devalue the Yuan in a series of moves that would send shockwaves through global financial markets.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Fears of an economic slowdown led to a flight to quality, and the Partnership benefitted from both short positions in stock indices and long positions in interest rate futures.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	Short positions in energy futures contracts detracted from the performance of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	The Partnership experienced a gain in September 2015 with the bulk of the positive performance coming from short positions in futures on stock indices.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	At the beginning of the month, the PBOC announced more stringent capital controls resulting in a 10% drop in the price of crude oil.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Partnership was well positioned in advance of the PBOC announcement by having short positions in crude oil contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Currencies were the only sector with negative performance during the month, and the Partnership s positions in currencies detracted from performance.

1469317_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	The Partnership s short positions in the FTSE China A50 and futures positions on European and U.S. stock indices detracted from performance.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P35_S5	The Partnership experienced a slight gain in May 2015.
1469317_17_ITEM7_P35_S6	After U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen s comments on May 6th that equity market valuations appeared high, the S P closed at its lowest level in over a month, and the Partnership experienced a loss in the first full week of trading since taking long positions.

1469317_17_ITEM15_P8_S0	The General Partner and Limited Partners of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. (the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of income (loss), the statements of changes in partners capital (net asset value) and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P9_S1	These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1469317_17_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P10_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P10_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P11_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P11_S1	Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2016, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P11_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P12_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations, the changes in its partners capital and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P13_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Advisors, L.L.C. (the "General Partner").
1469317_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P17_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and futures commission merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_17_ITEM15_P18_S1	Therefore, the Partnership follows the accounting and reporting guidelines for investment companies.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Level 3 Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
1469317_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P30_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs that include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	U.S. government bonds are categorized in Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, notes, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:
1469317_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	"Financial Derivative Instruments" for the fair value in each type of contracts within this category.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Partnership s policy is to recognize any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets as of the Partnership s fiscal year-end.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no Level 3 securities.

1469317_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Brokerage commissions on futures contracts include other trading fees and are incurred as an expense when contracts are opened, and are recognized as trading gains and losses.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Net realized gains and losses from foreign currency related transactions represent gains and losses from sales of foreign currencies, sales and maturities of futures contracts in foreign markets, currency gains and losses realized between trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Partnership s books and the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	Net unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency denominated other assets and liabilities arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	SG Americas Securities, LLC (the Clearing Broker ) is the Partnership s commodity broker.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	A portion of the Partnership s assets are held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or Treasury securities) in the Partnership s brokerage accounts at the Clearing Broker.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P50_S3	The Clearing Broker may convert the Partnership s cash in U.S. dollar to foreign currency to facilitate the Partnership s commodity trading activities.

1469317_17_ITEM15_P50_S5	Any net foreign currency on loan will be recognized in Foreign Currency Due to Broker on the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Partnership s Clearing Broker holds margin balances in a single currency, in which all margin requirements can be satisfied in U.S. dollars.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Foreign currency balances can also be used to satisfy margin requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership s restricted cash balance on the Statements of Financial Condition of $3,040,054 and $4,225,374, respectively, represents the collateral pledged by the Partnership to satisfy the Clearing Broker s margin requirements in US Dollars.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P51_S3	The Partnership s assets not deposited at the Clearing Broker are deposited with either the Custodian or held in bank cash accounts at Northern Trust Company (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses).

1469317_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Partnership is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	This is known as the initial margin.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	Subsequent payments ( variation margin ) are made or received by the Partnership each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are included in unrealized gain (loss) on futures contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Due to broker amounts on the Statements of Financial Condition represent the amount of any short fall in the Partnership s required cash margin.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Partnership recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as an investment option.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P57_S2	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.

1469317_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	At times, the Partnership s cash balance could exceed the insured amount under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
1469317_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Partnership has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not subject to any significant counterparty risk related to its cash account.

1469317_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The following presents the trading results of the Partnership s derivative trading and information related to the volume of the Partnership s derivative activity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Income (Loss) for gain (loss) on trading derivatives contracts.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the number of futures contracts closed was 22,156.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	These closed contract amounts are representative of the Partnership s volume of derivative activity during the year.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the number of futures contracts closed was 31,490.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	These closed contract amounts are representative of the Partnership s volume of derivative activity during the year.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the number of futures contracts closed was 58,163.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	With respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker to liquidate the Partnership s positions.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	These events include the following: (i) the Clearing Broker is directed or required by a regulatory or self-regulatory organization, (ii) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, (iii) upon the Partnership s breach or failure to perform on its contractual agreements with the Clearing Broker, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection of creditors against the Partnership, or (v) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities:
1469317_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Partnership posted additional collateral of $3,040,054 and $4,225,374 for 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the Clearing Broker.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Partnership may post collateral due to a variety of factors that may include, without limitation, initial margin or other requirements that are based on notional amounts which may exceed the fair value of the derivative contract.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P96_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P96_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P96_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P97_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P97_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P98_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P98_S3	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	Total return and the ratios to average net asset value are calculated for each class of Limited Partners capital taken as a whole.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P103_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	Total return is calculated on a monthly compounded basis.
1469317_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	Management of the Partnership evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued, and concluded that no events subsequent to December 31, 2016 have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure, except as noted below.

1469317_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Partnership did not sell any unregistered securities within the past three years which have not previously been included in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1469317_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners may redeem their Interests in the Partnership as of the end of any calendar month upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the General Partner.
1469317_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	The redemption of capital from capital accounts by Limited Partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other Limited Partners.
1469317_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table summarizes Limited Partner redemptions during the fourth calendar quarter of 2017:
1469317_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made to Item 8.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures trading.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	A portion of the Partnership s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through December 31, 2017 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and may trade options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Further, the Partnership s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	All of the futures contracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are exchange-traded.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	In the future, the Partnership anticipates that it will enter into non-exchange-traded foreign currency contracts and be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by SGAS and/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Partnership s success depends primarily upon QIM s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2017, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $2,832,125 from all trading; gains of $2,850,217 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $481,792.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Partnership incurred total expenses of $1,934,263, including $704,344 in incentive fees, $389,011 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $645,449 in service and professional fees.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Partnership earned $218,658 in interest income during 2017.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	Interest rates also moved higher which partially offset the Partnership s gains in stock indices.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	The Partnership s short positions in the Euro, Pound and Yen hindered profits as these specific currencies moved higher throughout July.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	The Partnership initially benefited from short crude oil positions until the market rose due to a drawdown in inventories and bullish production forecast from the Energy Information Administration.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P13_S5	Short positions in U.S. interest rate contracts limited overall losses in the sector, but long positions in metals were adversely impacted as money flowed to riskier assets.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	As a result of the uncertainty throughout the month, the U.S. Dollar traded lower and the Global Program benefited from long foreign currency positions.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The best performing sector was currencies, followed by stock indices and metals.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Partnership produced positive returns through early June, driven by stock index positions and strategic positioning in gold on both the long and short sides.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	These early gains reversed midmonth when volatility in equity markets dramatically increased following a sharp sell-off in tech stocks.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	The turbulence in equity markets was then coupled with the FOMC s decision on June 14th to kike the Fed Funds rate.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	These conditions, along with steadily declining energy markets, let to profits from short energy positions and losses from short U.S. and German interest rate positions through June 23rd.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	After initially sustaining losses on long interest rate positions, the Partnership went short midmonth.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	A hawkish speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on January 18th led to a selloff in interest rate futures, turning the sector positive for the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The bulk of the energy sector s underperformance occurred early in January when short crude oil positions took a hit on record export numbers out of Iraq, which raised concerns about the stability of OPEC s production agreement.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	In February 2017, the Partnership experienced a slightly positive net performance gain, driven by gains in interest rates and currencies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	The worst performing sector was stock indices, followed by metals and energies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	February began with uncertainty, as short U.S. and European stock index positions suffered as markets ground higher on relatively low volatility and little news.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Partnership reversed to long midmonth, which tempered losses as stock indices continued to rise.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Partnership fared much better in the interest rate sector.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Initially long U.S. Treasuries, the Partnership reversed in time to benefit from declining rates through the middle of February.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	These gains were partially offset by a growing long position in European interest rates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	Bonds reached their monthly low on the 15th but traded higher into month end, which resulted in profits as European interest rates had become the Partnership s largest positon.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S6	End-of-month gains in the sector were driven by the Euro-Bund.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P26_S7	For March 2017, the Partnership again ended the month with slightly positive performance, driven by stock indices, metals and currencies, and with interests rates and energies detracting from overall performance.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Partnership initially experienced strong performance as U.S. stock indices surged to all-time highs on the first day of the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Equity markets then edged lower on concerns of the upcoming presidential election in France and the debate over health care reform in the United States.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Partnership reduced its long positions throughout the month, going net short for a brief period before going long again ahead of a vote in Congress regarding U.S. health care.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Initially trading lower on disappointment from Congress failure to pass health care legislation, stock indices shrugged off the news and traded higher into month end.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	Profits in long U.S. and European stock indices were offset in part by losses in long European interest rates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	The Partnership reversed interest rate positions midmonth, racking up losses on short European positions as markets traded higher in the second half of March.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P27_S6	To its benefit, the Partnership shifted its U.S. interest rate positions from short to long during the month, which limited losses for the sector overall.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2016 is set forth below.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Partnership was down for the month of October 2016.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Underperformance was driven by stock indices, while the most profitable sector was currencies, followed by metals.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Early in the month, long stock index and interest rate positions suffered as markets digested hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve, a rising dollar and continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Partnership remained net long as stock indices recovered, only to sell off again in the last week of trading when the focus on the election intensified.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Short positions in interest rate futures acquired mid-month did offset some of those losses as bonds traded to their lowest level in four months.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	The U.S. Dollar strengthened throughout the month, benefiting the Partnership s short currency positions.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S4	The bulk of profits in the metals sector were attributed to a short position in gold, for which prices collapsed early in the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S5	The Partnership had overall positive returns for the month of November, 2016, with performance driven by stock indices, while metals were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S6	The Partnership began the month with significant long U.S. stock index positions.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S7	Initially, markets traded lower ahead of uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election, and post-election, stock markets sold off dramatically only to rebound and close higher by the end of the following trading day.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S8	The Partnership remained long while indices climbed higher through the end of the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S9	A long gold position acquired midmonth was the primary driver for losses in the metals sector with that market trading to nine-month lows on continued strength in the equity markets.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S10	In the energies sector, the Partnership sustained losses on short crude oil positions as markets moved higher on speculation that OPEC was nearing an agreement for production cuts.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P31_S11	The Partnership was up for the month of December 2016.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The most profitable sectors were stock indices, followed by interest rates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The only sector with negative performance was metals.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Early in the month, long stock index positions suffered as equity prices traded lower on concerns that the postelection rally was overdone and questions about the trade policy of the incoming administration.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	However, the Partnership increased its long exposure to the sector and profited as markets reversed later in the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Long interest rate positions were a steady drag on performance until mid-month, but after an interest rate announcement on December 15, 2016, interest rate futures crept higher for the remainder of the month, pushing the sector into profitable territory in the second half of the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Strength in equity markets and trade policy concerns led to general weakness in prices for the metals sector.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Partnership was mixed for the month of July 2016, ending the month flat to slightly negative.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	The only profitable sector was stock indices.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Returns initially had a strong start with long U.S. and short European stock index positions but lingering concerns over the impact of Brexit weighed on European indices, while U.S. indices outperformed on the back of a surprisingly strong nonfarm payroll number on July 8th.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Performance in stock indices remained strong throughout the month; however, losses in long interest rate positions offset much of these gains as bonds moved higher on the increased probability of rate hikes.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Partnership remained net long stock indices but reversed into short interest rate futures in anticipation of an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	As expected, rates were left unchanged and, despite a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, stocks and bonds both traded higher with losses in interest rate futures offsetting gains in stock indices.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	Thereafter, focus shifted to the Bank of Japan meeting, which disappointed markets with a less accommodative monetary and fiscal policy than had been expected.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	The Yen surged higher and the Partnership s short Yen position eroded much of the overall gains going into month end.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S6	In August 2016, the Partnership experienced positive overall performance with the most profitable sector being interest rates, followed closely by stock indices.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S7	Metals were slightly positive, while the currency and energy sectors were both negative.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S8	The Partnership initially profited as with net long stock index and short interest rate positions, as the S P and Nasdaq soared to record highs, and then reversed into short stock indices in the middle of the month as equity markets became increasingly choppy.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S9	Despite a decidedly hawkish tone by the Federal Reserve at an August 2016 meeting, equity markets traded higher into month end, paring gains in the stock index sector.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S10	Losses in the currency sector early in the month were attributed to a short Yen position that declined when the Bank of Japan announced stimulus measures that did not include further monetary easing.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S11	By month end, the Partnership had reversed into long currency positions and suffered additional losses as the U.S. Dollar surged.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S12	In September 2016, the Partnership experienced solid profits as the main driver of performance was stock indices, whereas the worst performing sector was currencies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S13	The Partnership came into the month short global equity indices and achieved mixed results through the first week of trading.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S14	Between September 9th 10th, signals in equity indices reversed as global stock markets sold off dramatically on the 9th and rallied back on the 10th.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S15	The Partnership earned significant profits on both sides of the trade, and returns remained long going into the September Federal Reserve, which spurred a two-day rally in U.S. equity markets.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S16	The Partnership then gave back a portion of gains as markets became increasingly choppy going into month end.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S17	Currency losses accrued early in the month and were primarily attributable to short Euro positions as a hawkish European Central Bank meeting sent the currency sharply higher.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P37_S18	The bulk of the losses in energies came in the last week of trading when short crude positions suffered on the news that OPEC had reached a preliminary agreement on the first production cuts in eight years.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Partnership was flat to slightly negative for the month of April 2016.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Currencies were the most profitable sector, followed by stock indices and metals.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Interest rates were the worst performing sector, followed by energies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Partnership came into the month short all stock index contracts, making substantial profits in the first week of trading as equity markets traded lower.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	As the month wore on, equity markets recovered on the back of a marginally positive earnings season domestically and the lack of any significant negative headlines internationally.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Partnership maintained a net short position as markets trended higher, erasing earlier profits and going negative in the sector until equity markets began to falter late in the month on disappointing news from the Bank of Japan as to its leaving rates unchanged and failing to increase stimulus.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S5	This sent equity markets sharply lower and the Yen skyrocketed to new multi-year highs resulting in gains for the Partnership.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S6	While bonds moved lower on equity strength, the possibility of a June rate hike from the FOMC limited the upside as equities sold off.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S7	The Partnership experienced profits in May 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates and currencies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S8	Following a late April FOMC statement that lowered the likelihood for a June 2016 rate hike, concerns regarding the global economy were further heightened in the first week of May by weak Caixin PMI data in China and disappointing nonfarm payroll numbers in the United States.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S9	These events caused a flight to quality during early in the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P39_S10	During this period, the Partnership traded the Euro-Bund, U.S. 30-Year Bond, Long Gilt, S P and Hang Seng futures contracts to secure gains in the interest rates and stock indices sectors.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	As the month progressed, a shift in the Federal Reserve s tone indicated a likely rate hike due to an improving economy, and coupled with substantial short covering and reports of a surge in U.S. new home sales, a strong rally in equity indices and commodities ensued (offset by a decline in global interest rate futures).
1469317_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The second half of May saw the Partnership benefitting from long positions in U.S. equity indices, while it suffered from short positions in European equity indices and long positions across U.S. Treasuries.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Partnership was up slightly for the month of June 2016, with the most profitable sector being stock indices, followed by interest rates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The only negative sector was currencies.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Volatility across global financial markets was largely driven by expectations and reactions around the FOMC decision to hold on an interest rate hike and the U.K. referendum vote.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	With the uncertainty of an interest rate hike removed, attention became squarely focused on the outcome of Brexit vote.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	As resultant volatility ensued, the Partnership benefitted from positions in the DJ Euro Stoxx 50, Dax, U.S. 30-Year Bond and Gold, and risk exposure leading up to the Brexit vote was reduced.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Partnership suffered losses during the days preceding the Brexit vote but recouped most of those losses as markets reacted sharply to the surprising decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Over the last three days of June 2016, the Partnership gave back profits in the stock indices sector as global equity markets rallied.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Partnership experienced net gains for the month of January 2016, with interest rates contributing most of the profits, followed by stock indices; whereas on the negative side, energies were the worst performing sector, followed by currency positions that also suffered declines in the period.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Partnership maintained short positions in U.S. European stock indices and long positions in interest rates throughout January resulting in strong returns early in the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Partnership initially posted modest gains from short crude oil positions before reversing into substantial long positions thereafter.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	After a temporary rally, the price of crude oil resumed its downward trend, causing the long positions to sustain losses by month-end.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	The Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy near month-end, with equity markets trading higher while the Yen dropped sharply costing the Partnership a significant portion of the gains it had made earlier in the month.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	The Partnership enjoyed solid net positive performance for the month of February 2016, led by gains in stock indices, followed by positive returns in the interest rates, energies and currencies sectors.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P45_S6	The only negative sector for the month was metals.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Short positions in crude oil and stock indices benefitted from global growth early in the period.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Upon reversing the shorts into longs mid-month, the Partnership s positions in stock indices and crude oil profited due to positive economic data and rallying markets, followed by the Partnership reversing again to shorts allowing it to eke out marginal additional gains as equity markets remained choppy through month-end.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	A long position in Yen held throughout the month of February was responsible for most of the profits that month in the currencies sector.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Partnership s losses in the metals sector for the period were attributed to a short Gold position as that market trended higher.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	The Partnership sustained a net loss for the month of March 2016, with stock indices being the worst-performing sector, and currencies, interest rates and energies each experiencing slightly negative returns.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S5	The only positive sector was metals for the period.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S6	Losses were sustained in short stock index positions and long interest rate positions were due to strong economic data coupled with dovish statements from the Federal Reserve leading to the perception that, despite improving economic conditions, a rate hike was unlikely in March.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S7	Short positions in currencies and energies added to losses as the U.S. Dollar surged and commodity prices moved higher throughout the period.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P46_S8	The metals sector was the only bright spot in March, as the Partnership began the month short metals, then reversed mid-month into long positions, making back earlier losses and posting moderate gains as Gold rose on continued bullish sentiment.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The General Partner believes that the Partnership s most critical accounting estimates relate to the valuation of the Partnership s assets.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Futures and options on futures contracts are valued using the primary exchange s closing price.

1469317_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the statement of financial condition.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), which require the use of certain estimates made by the Partnership s management.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, the General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are appropriate and reasonable, however actual results could differ from these estimates.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	The estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment.
1469317_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership s critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported.

1469317_18_ITEM15_P13_S3	As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P13_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P14_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P14_S2	Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2017, by correspondence with the custodian and broker.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P14_S3	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P14_S4	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P15_S0	We have served as the Partnership s auditor since 2011.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P16_S0	The rate reported is the effective yield at time of purchase.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	Altegris QIM Futures Fund, L.P. ( Partnership ) was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2009.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Partnership's general partner is Altegris Advisors, L.L.C. (the General Partner ).
1469317_18_ITEM15_P17_S2	The General Partner has overall responsibility for the management, operation and administration of the Partnership, including the selection of its commodity trading adviser.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P17_S3	The Partnership s trading activities are conducted pursuant to an advisory contract with Quantitative Investment Management LLC (the Advisor ).
1469317_18_ITEM15_P17_S4	The Partnership speculatively trades commodity futures contracts, and may trade options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other commodity interests.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	The objective of the Partnership s business is appreciation of its assets.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	It is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), an agency of the United States ( U.S. ) government that regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of commodity exchanges and futures commission merchants (brokers) through which the Partnership trades.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Partnership s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1469317_18_ITEM15_P19_S1	Therefore, the Partnership follows the accounting and reporting guidelines for investment companies.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P19_S2	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported fair value of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31 2017 and 2016, and reported amounts of income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P19_S3	Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that the differences could be material.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	In accordance with the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	In determining fair value, the Partnership uses various valuation approaches.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	The authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Partnership.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	Unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
1469317_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	Level 3 Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
1469317_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary among assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of asset or liability, whether the asset or liability is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the asset or liability existed.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P27_S3	Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Partnership in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Partnership s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Partnership uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including prices and inputs during periods of market dislocation.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many assets and liabilities.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Partnership values futures contracts at the closing price of the contract s primary exchange.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Partnership includes futures contracts in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are exchange traded derivatives.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	The fair value of U.S. government agency bonds and notes is generally based on quoted prices in active markets.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	When quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that uses inputs that include interest-rate yield curves, cross-currency-basis index spreads, and country credit spreads similar to the bond in terms of issue, maturity and seniority.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	U.S. government agency bonds and notes are generally categorized in Level I or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the Partnership s holdings in U.S. government agency bonds and notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	The fair value of U.S. treasury obligations is generally based on quoted prices.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	U.S. treasury obligations are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	The fair value of corporate notes is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), notes spreads or credit default swap spreads.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	The spread data used are for the same maturity as that of the notes.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the spread data does not reference the issuer, data that references a comparable issuer is used.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond, or single-name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as key inputs.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	These valuation methods represent both a market and income approach to fair value measurement.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	Corporate notes are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, in instances where significant inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the Partnership s holdings in corporate notes were fair valued using valuation models.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	There were no changes in the Partnership s valuation methodology during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following table presents information about the Partnership s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

1469317_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	Net unrealized gain (loss) on other assets and other liabilities denominated in foreign currency arise from changes in the value of assets, other than investments in securities, and liabilities at fiscal year-end, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian ) is the Partnership s custodian.

1469317_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	In addition, there is the risk that the Partnership may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	Open positions in futures contracts at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are reflected within the Condensed Schedules of Investments.

1469317_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts for the purpose of achieving capital appreciation.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P85_S1	None of the Partnership s derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), nor are they used for other risk management purposes.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Advisor and General Partner actively assess, manage and monitor risk exposure on derivatives on a contract basis, a sector basis (e.g., interest rate derivatives, agricultural derivatives, etc.), and on an overall basis in accordance with established risk parameters.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	Due to the speculative nature of the Partnership s derivative trading activity, the Partnership is subject to the risk of substantial losses from derivatives trading.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	The following presents the fair value of derivative contracts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P87_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is presented as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P87_S2	Fair value is presented on a gross basis in the table below even though the derivative contracts qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	The following presents the trading results of the Partnership s derivative trading and information related to the volume of the Partnership s derivative activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	The below captions of Realized and Change in Unrealized correspond to the captions in the Statements of Income (Loss) for gain (loss) on trading derivatives contracts.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, the number of futures contracts closed was 29,414.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	These closed contract amounts are representative of the Partnership s volume of derivative activity during the year.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the number of futures contracts closed was 22,156.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	These closed contract amounts are representative of the Partnership s volume of derivative activity during the year.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the number of futures contracts closed was 31,490.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	These closed contract amounts are representative of the Partnership s volume of derivative activity during the year.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	With respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the Clearing Broker which grants the Clearing Broker the right to offset recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities if certain conditions exist, which would require the Clearing Broker to liquidate the Partnership s positions.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	These events include the following: (i) the Clearing Broker is directed or required by a regulatory or self-regulatory organization, (ii) the Clearing Broker determines, at its discretion, that the risk in the Partnership s account must be reduced for protection of the Clearing Broker, (iii) upon the Partnership s breach or failure to perform on its contractual agreements with the Clearing Broker, (iv) upon the commencement of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding for the protection of creditors against the Partnership, or (v) upon the dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or merger of the Partnership.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities:
1469317_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	(1) The Partnership posted additional collateral of $1,548,029 for 2017 and $3,040,054 for 2016 with the Clearing Broker.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Partnership may post collateral due to a variety of factors that may include, without limitation, initial margin or other requirements that are based on notional amounts which may exceed the fair value of the derivative contract.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges and interbank market makers.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	Further, the Clearing Broker has the right to require margin in excess of the minimum exchange requirement.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of brokers or interbank market makers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk).
1469317_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	All of the contracts currently traded by the Partnership are exchange traded.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P98_S2	However, in the future, if the Partnership were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P98_S3	The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty to all domestic futures contracts is the exchange clearing corporation.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by the Clearing Broker.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	The Partnership's policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial position and credit exposure reporting and control procedures.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P99_S3	In addition, the Partnership has a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each clearing broker or counterparty with which it conducts business.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Partnership has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with the Custodian in U.S. government agency bonds and notes and corporate notes.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	Risks arise from investments in bonds and notes due to possible illiquidity and the potential for default by the issuer or counterparty.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	Such instruments are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and economic conditions.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P102_S2	The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	The following information presents the financial highlights of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	This information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	Total return and the ratios to average net asset value are calculated for each class of Limited Partners capital taken as a whole.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	An individual Limited Partner s total return and ratios may vary from the above returns and ratios due to the timing of their contributions and withdrawals and differing fee structures.
1469317_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	Total return is calculated on a monthly compounded basis.
