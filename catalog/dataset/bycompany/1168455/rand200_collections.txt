1168455_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In addition to its branch network, the Bank operates a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Bank s primary business is servicing the banking needs of these communities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	Its marketing strategy stresses its local ownership and commitment to serve the banking needs of individuals living and working in the Bank s primary service areas.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	With a predominant focus on personal service, the Bank has positioned itself as a multi-community independent bank serving the financial needs of individuals and businesses within the Bank s geographic footprint.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our principal retail lending services include consumer and home equity loans.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our principal commercial lending services include term real estate, land development and construction loans.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	In addition, we provide commercial and industrial term, government-guaranteed and agricultural loans as well as credit lines.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Bank s Government-guaranteed lending center, headquartered in Auburn, California with additional personnel in Truckee, provides Small Business Administration and USDA Rural Development loans to qualified borrowers throughout Northern California and Northern Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	During 2007 the Bank was granted nationwide Preferred Lender status with the U.S. Small Business Administration and we expect government-guaranteed lending to continue to be an important part of our overall lending operation.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	During 2010 we sold $13.6 million in government-guaranteed loans and generated a gain on sale of $1.1 million.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Agricultural Credit Centers located in Susanville and Alturas provide a complete line of credit services in support of the agricultural activities which are key to the continued economic development of the communities we serve.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Ag lending clients include a full range of individual farming customers, small- to medium-sized business farming organizations and corporate farming units.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the principal areas to which we directed our lending activities, and the percentage of our total loan portfolio comprised by each, were as follows: (i) loans secured by real estate 61.7%; (ii) commercial and industrial loans 10.6%; (iii) consumer loans (including residential equity lines of credit) 15.5%; and (iv) agricultural loans (including agricultural real estate loans) 12.2%.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	In addition to the lending activities noted above, we offer a wide range of deposit products for the retail and commercial banking markets including checking, interest-bearing checking, business sweep, public funds sweep, savings, time deposit and retirement accounts, as well as remote deposit, telephone and mobile banking and internet banking with bill-pay options.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Interest bearing deposits include high yield sweep accounts designed for our commercial customers and for public entities such as municipalities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition we offer a Money Fund Plu$ checking account for our consumer customers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	These accounts pay rates comparable to those available on a money fund offered by a typical brokerage firm.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the Bank had 30,372 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $425 million, compared to 31,173 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $437 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, extended hours, remote deposit operations and drive-up banking, all provided with a high level of customer service.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $14,000 at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	At December 31, 2010 we had $2 million in CDARS reciprocal time deposits which for regulatory purposes are classified as brokered deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	These include cashier s checks, traveler s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers, on-line banking, remote deposit, mobile banking and other customary banking services.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	In order to provide non-deposit investment options, we have developed a strategic alliance with Financial Network Investment Corporation ( FNIC ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Through this arrangement, certain employees of the Bank are also licensed representatives of FNIC.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	These employees provide our customers throughout our branch network with convenient access to annuities, insurance products, mutual funds, and a full range of investment products.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	During 2007 we added Remote Deposit to our product mix.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Remote Deposit allows our customers to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during the last two fiscal years, including an on balance sheet business sweep product which we introduced during the first quarter of 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	During 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage while providing the customer with the opportunity to grow their savings through monthly monetary rewards for green behavior.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee have expanded and with the opening our Auburn commercial lending office, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We offer various loan products which promote home ownership and affordable housing, fuel job growth and support community economic development.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, and government-guaranteed community infrastructure loans.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Capital Purchase Program TARP Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and pays cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Warrant has a 10-year term and was immediately exercisable with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Prior to January 30, 2012, unless the Company has redeemed the Series A Preferred Stock, or the Treasury has transferred the Series A Preferred Stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required for the Company to: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of the Common Stock (other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than $0.04 per share or regular semi-annual cash dividends of not more than $0.08 per share); or (2) redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Common Stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the Trust I ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Debentures and trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly based on the floating rate described above on the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per security.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	The Company has entered into contractual agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee payment of: (1) accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the capital securities; (2) the redemption price with respect to any capital securities called for redemption by either Trust I or Trust II, and (3) payments due upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up, or liquidation of either Trust I or Trust II.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Effective March 16, 2011, in connection with the Bank s regularly scheduled 2010 Joint FDIC and California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) examination, the Bank entered into a Consent Order ( Order ) with the FDIC and the DFI.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	The FDIC and DFI in the Order, require certain actions to be taken by the Bank including among others: continue to reduce certain classified asset balances, maintain strong capital ratios, improve lending policies and practices, and retain qualified management as stated in the terms of the order.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	One of Management s top priorities has and will continue to be to reduce it problem assets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The order services to formalize and reinforce the Company s on-goings plans to strengthen the Company s operations and to implement the Bank s strategic plan.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	Currently the Bank has exceeded the Order s total risk-based capital ratio goal of 13% and Management expects to achieve the leverage ratio target of 10% by year-end without the injection of any new capital.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information related to the Order.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Banks assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	However, at December 31, 2010 approximately 80% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P48_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Currently, within the Bank s branch service area there are 64 banking branch offices of competing institutions, including 28 branches of 7 major banks.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	As of June 30, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 72%, Quincy 57%, Portola 52%, Alturas 50%, Fall River Mills 40%, Kings Beach 35%, Susanville 34%, Truckee 17%, Tahoe City 4%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Redding is the location of our most recently opened branch, which became operational in June 2007.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, home computer, mobile, ATMs, full-service branches, and/or in-store branches.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company and its subsidiary employed 157 persons.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 146 persons.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	We believe our employee relations are excellent.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including Plumas Bancorp s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	This Code of Ethics Policy is available on Plumas Bancorp s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the BHCA ), and are registered with and subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	It is the policy of the FRB, that each bank holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	We are required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	The FRB has the authority to examine us and our subsidiary, as well as any arrangements between us and our subsidiary, with the cost of any such examination to be borne by us.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The BHCA requires us to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to the acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of that bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Amendments to the BHCA expand the circumstances under which a bank holding company may acquire control of all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located outside the State of California.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	We may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiary, with the exception of certain activities which, in the opinion of the FRB, are so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be incidental to banking.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition, we are generally prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company unless that company is engaged in such authorized activities and the Federal Reserve approves the acquisition.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	We and our subsidiary are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or provision of services.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	For example, with certain exceptions, the bank may not condition an extension of credit on a customer obtaining other services provided by us, the bank or any other subsidiary of ours, or on a promise by the customer not to obtain other services from a competitor.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, federal law imposes certain restrictions on transactions between the bank and its affiliates.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	As affiliates, the bank and we are subject, with certain exceptions, to the provisions of federal law imposing limitations on and requiring collateral for extensions of credit by the bank to any affiliate.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	As a California state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve, Plumas Bank is subject to primary supervision, examination and regulation by the FDIC, the California Department of Financial Institutions (the DFI ) and is subject to applicable regulations of the FRB.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC to applicable limits.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in California and the United States, banks are particularly susceptible to changes in California and federal legislation and regulations, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of California affect the operations of the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	Federal and California statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank s operations, including reserves against deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, branching, capital requirements and disclosure obligations to depositors and borrowers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	California law presently permits a bank to locate a branch office in any locality in the state.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Additionally, California law exempts banks from California usury laws.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	The FRB and the FDIC have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P71_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Since December 31, 1992, the FRB and the FDIC have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 8%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 4%.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB and FDIC require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	As discussed above, we are required to maintain certain levels of capital, as is the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and Bancorp as of December 31, 2010 follow:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all their capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009; however, as a result of the Order the Bank has agreed to maintain capital ratios in excess of those defined above as Well Capitalized .
1168455_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to the Order.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance of deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	Additionally, a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	The deposit insurance fund of the FDIC insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in a comprehensive manner revised the deposit insurance assessment system including the specific mandate that the FDIC require the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	continued the FDIC s authority to declare dividends when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar year is at least 1.5 percent, but granted the FDIC sole discretion in determining whether to suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	In February 2011, the FDIC adopted conforming regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that (i) modifies the definition of an institution s deposit insurance assessment base, (ii) changes the assessment rate adjustments (and includes the unsecured debt adjustment, which lowers an institution s assessment rate to recognize the buffer that long-term unsecured and subordinated debt provides the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund), (iii) revises the deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the new assessment base and altered related adjustments; to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 dividend provisions; (iv) revises the large insured depository institution assessment system to differentiate for risk and determine account losses from large institution failures that the FDIC may incur; and to (vi) make technical and other changes to the FDIC s assessment rules.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	The new rules are effective April 1, 2011, and the assessment rate would range between a minimum of 2 basis points and a maximum of 45 basis points.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	In addition, the FDIC Board may increase or decrease such total base assessment rates up to a maximum increase of 2 basis points or a fraction thereof or a maximum decrease of 2 basis points or a fraction thereof (after aggregating increases and decreases), as the Board deems necessary.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	In setting assessment rates, the Board shall take into consideration the following:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	any other factors the Board may deem appropriate.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	The new rules would likely lower the overall assessment for smaller banks such as the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	However, due to the significant losses at failed banks and expected losses for banks that will fail, there are no assurances that FDIC insurance fund assessments on the Bank will not increase, and such increased assessments may materially adversely affect the profitability of the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, depending on the amount or frequency of the assessment.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Furthermore, the FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	The termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the FHLB-SF ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Among other benefits, each Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	The FHLB-SF utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of $100 per share, which may be issued, exchanged, redeemed and repurchased only at par value.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own FHLB SF capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	an activity based stock requirement (based on percentage of outstanding advances).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	The FHLB SF capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice, subject to certain conditions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	At December 31, 2010 the Bank owned 21,884 shares of the FHLB-SF capital stock.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with these requirements.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	The earnings and growth of the Company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions, including inflation, recession and unemployment.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	The earnings of the Company are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and federal agencies, particularly the FRB.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	The FRB can and does implement national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open market operations in United States Government securities and by its control of the discount rates applicable to borrowings by banks from the FRB.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P94_S3	The actions of the FRB in these areas influence the growth of bank loans and leases, investments and deposits and affect the interest rates charged on loans and leases and paid on deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P94_S4	The FRB s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Extensions of Credit to Insiders and Transactions with Affiliates.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director or principal shareholder.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan-to-one-borrower limits, require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts, must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as, and follow credit-underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	In addition, Regulation O provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P99_S2	Regulation O also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director, except pursuant to a written pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre-authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA ) is intended to encourage insured depository institutions, while operating safely and soundly, to help meet the credit needs of their communities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	The CRA specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository institutions, to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S2	The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or holding company formations .
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S3	The agencies use the CRA assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S4	The ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P101_S5	In its last examination for CRA compliance, as of August 2005, the Bank was rated satisfactory.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the ECOA ) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	The Truth in Lending Act (the TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Fair Housing Act (the FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act (the RFPA ) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (the RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with CRA, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, HMDA, RFPA and RESPA generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	Federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time, and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	The following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	The 2010 Tax Relief Act was enacted on December 17, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	The 2010 Tax Relief Act extends on a temporary basis the bonus depreciation for taxable years 2011 and 2012.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	For small businesses, the maximum amount and phase-out threshold under section 179 for taxable years 2012 are set at $125,000 and $500,000 respectively, indexed for inflation.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	The law also provided a one-year reauthorization of federal UI benefits and cuts FICA taxes for employees to 4.2 percent and those self employed to 10.4 percent on self-employment income up to $106,800.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 ( SBA Jobs Act ) enacted in September 2010 provides numerous tax breaks for small businesses including start up small businesses, and more importantly for insured financial institutions eligibility for participation in a U S Treasury program that will provide a maximum $30 billion for purchases of preferred stock and other debt instruments issued by eligible financial institutions for the purpose of increasing credit availability for small businesses.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	In addition, there are important changes to various SBA loan administration programs to aid small businesses under the SBA Jobs Act.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	The SBA Jobs Act provides for increasing maximum individual loan limits of SBA loans, extending the higher government guarantee level and waiver of borrower fees for certain SBA loans, and allowing alternative underwriting measures, specifically net worth and net income to allow more small businesses to participate in certain SBA loans.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in July, 2010, will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P114_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act creates of a new interagency council, the Financial System Oversight Council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the U.S. economy posed by systemically significant, large financial companies, including bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P114_S2	The Office of Thrift Supervision will be eliminated and its powers distributed among the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P114_S3	The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P116_S1	Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P116_S2	The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	The legislation also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P117_S1	Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P117_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2013.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P117_S3	The Dodd-Frank Act also repeals the prohibition on payment of interest on corporate demand deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will not take effect for at least a year, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	Although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those provisions relating to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will increase the Bank s operating and compliance costs as it is likely that the Bank s existing regulatory agencies will adopt the same or similar consumer protections as the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will adopt.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the EFTA ) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer ( EFT ) systems.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	The EFTA is implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse ( ACH ) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P119_S2	Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P119_S3	Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	The new rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	The new rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P120_S2	For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	The mandatory compliance date for the Regulation E amendments was July 1, 2010 and provided the Bank with the ability to continue to assess overdraft service fees or charges on existing customer accounts up to August 15, 2010, without obtaining the consumer s affirmative consent.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	The Bank s compliance with the new Regulation E amendments will have an impact on the Bank s revenue from overdraft service fees and non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) charges.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	In May 2009 the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	The new law permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P122_S2	In implementing the law, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to (1) provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) make mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P122_S3	The new law also authorizes the Secretary of HUD to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P122_S4	The new law also amends the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	Also in May 2009, the Credit Card Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S1	The new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions, such as when a promotional rate ends, there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S2	Interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S3	Significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S4	The new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers (such as utility companies and other creditors) for existing credit card balances, though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S5	The new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S6	Opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S7	They have at least five years to pay the balance.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S8	Credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under 21, unless they have adult co-signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P123_S9	Credit card companies must stay at least 1,000 feet from college campuses if they are offering free pizza or other gifts to entice students to apply for credit cards.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	The new Act requires card issuers to give card account holders a reasonable amount of time to make payments on monthly bills.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	That means payments would be due at least 21 days after they are mailed or delivered.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P124_S2	Credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	When consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	Consumers must opt in to over-limit fees.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P125_S2	Those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P125_S3	Fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P125_S4	Finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	Fees on credit cards cannot exceed 25 percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	Credit card issuers must disclose to cardholders the consequences of making only minimum payments each month, namely how long it would take to pay off the entire balance if users only made the minimum monthly payment.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	Issuers must also provide information on how much users must pay each month if they want to pay off their balances in 36 months, including the amount of interest.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling US economy.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P128_S1	ARRA authorizes spending of $787 billion, including about $288 billion for tax relief, $144 billion for state and local relief aid, and $111 billion for infrastructure and science.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P128_S2	In addition, ARRA includes additional executive compensation restrictions for recipients of funds from the US Treasury under the Troubled Assets Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( EESA ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P128_S3	The provisions of EESA amended by the ARRA include (i) expanding the coverage of the executive compensation limits to as many as the 25 most highly compensated employees of a TARP funds recipient and its affiliates for certain aspects of executive compensation limits and (ii) specifically limiting incentive compensation of covered executives to one-third of their annual compensation which is required to be paid in restricted stock that does not vest until all of the TARP funds are no longer outstanding (note that if TARP warrants remain outstanding and no other TARP instruments are outstanding, then such warrants would not be considered outstanding for purposes of this incentive compensation restriction.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P128_S4	In addition, the board of directors of any TARP recipient is required under EESA, as amended to have a company-wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures, as identified by the Treasury, which may include excessive expenditures on entertainment or events; office and facility renovations; aviation or other transportation services; or other activities or events that are not reasonable expenditures for staff development, reasonable performance incentives, or other similar measures conducted in the normal course of the business operations of the TARP recipient.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P129_S0	On February 10, 2009, the U. S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision all announced a comprehensive set of measures to restore confidence in the strength of U.S. financial institutions and restart the critical flow of credit to households and businesses.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P129_S1	This program is intended to restore the flows of credit necessary to support recovery.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	A new Capital Assistance Program to help ensure that our banking institutions have sufficient capital to withstand the challenges ahead, paired with a supervisory process to produce a more consistent and forward-looking assessment of the risks on banks balance sheets and their potential capital needs.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	A new Public-Private Investment Fund on an initial scale of up to $500 billion, with the potential to expand up to $1 trillion, to catalyze the removal of legacy assets from the balance sheets of financial institutions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	This fund will combine public and private capital with government financing to help free up capital to support new lending.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	A new Treasury and Federal Reserve initiative to dramatically expand up to $1 trillion the existing Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility (TALF) in order to reduce credit spreads and restart the securitized credit markets that in recent years supported a substantial portion of lending to households, students, small businesses, and others.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	An extension of the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to October 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P133_S1	A new framework of governance and oversight to help ensure that banks receiving funds are held responsible for appropriate use of those funds through stronger conditions on lending, dividends and executive compensation along with enhanced reporting to the public.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	In October 2008, the President signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( EESA ), in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 authorizing the United States Secretary of the Treasury with authority to spend up to $700 billion to purchase distressed assets, especially mortgage-backed securities, under the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) and make capital injections into banks under the Capital Purchase Program.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P134_S1	EESA gives the government the unprecedented authority to buy troubled assets on balance sheets of financial institutions under the Troubled Assets Relief Program and increases the limit on insured deposits from $100,000 to $250,000 through December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P134_S2	Some of the other provisions of EESA are as follows:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	qualified financial institutions may count losses on FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock against ordinary income, rather than capital gain income.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	On February 10, 2009, the Treasury Secretary announced a new comprehensive financial stability legislation (the Financial Stability Plan ), which earmarked the second $350 billion of unused funds originally authorized under the EESA.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P136_S1	The major elements of the Financial Stability Plan included: (i) a capital assistance program that has invested in convertible preferred stock of certain qualifying institutions, (ii) a consumer and business lending initiative to fund new consumer loans, small business loans and commercial mortgage asset-backed securities issuances, (iii) a public/private investment fund intended to leverage public and private capital with public financing to purchase up to $500 billion to $1 trillion of legacy toxic assets from financial institutions, and (iv) assistance for homeowners by providing up to $75 billion to reduce mortgage payments and interest rates and establishing loan modification guidelines for government and private programs.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	On October 22, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S1	The proposal, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S2	The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large, complex banking organizations.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S3	Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S4	In addition, the proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P137_S5	Similarly, on January 12, 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment through advance notice of rule making on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged at higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	On September 3, 2009, the U.S. Treasury issued a policy statement entitled Principles for Reforming the U.S. and International Regulatory Capital Framework for Banking Firms.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P138_S1	The statement was developed in consultation with the U.S. bank regulatory agencies and sets forth eight core principles intended to shape a new international capital accord.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P138_S2	Six of the core principles relate directly to bank capital requirements.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	The statement contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime that would involve substantial revisions to, if not replacement of, major parts of the Basel I and Basel II and affect all regulated banking organizations and other systemically important institutions.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	The statement calls for higher and stronger capital requirements for bank and non-bank financial firms that are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability due to their combination of size, leverage, interconnectedness and liquidity risk.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	The statement suggested that changes to the regulatory capital framework be phased in over a period of several years with a recommended schedule providing for a comprehensive international agreement by December 31, 2010, with the implementation of reforms by December 31, 2012, although it does remain possible that U.S. bank regulatory agencies could officially adopt, or informally implement, new capital standards at an earlier date.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	Following the issuance of the statement, on December 17, 2009, the Basel committee issued a set of proposals (the Capital Proposals ) that would significantly revise the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, with the most significant changes being to Tier 1 capital.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P140_S1	Most notably, the Capital Proposals would disqualify certain structured capital instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital status.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P140_S2	The Capital Proposals would also re-emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of Tier 1 capital by adding a minimum common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio and requiring that goodwill, general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from Tier 1 capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of Tier 1 capital.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P140_S3	The Capital Proposals also leave open the possibility that the Basel committee will recommend changes to the minimum Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	Concurrently with the release of the Capital Proposals, the Basel committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure (the Liquidity Proposals ).
1168455_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	The Liquidity Proposals have three key elements, including the implementation of (i) a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario, (ii) a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon, and (iii) a set of monitoring tools that the Basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors and that supervisors should use in monitoring the liquidity risk profiles of supervised entities.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	In California, SB931 enacted in 2010 requires the holder of a first mortgage or deed of trust that is secured by 1-4 family residential real property to accept as full payment, the proceeds of a short sale to which it agrees to in writing, and obligates the holder to discharge the remaining amount of a borrower s indebtedness on such mortgage or deed of trust (excludes borrowers that are corporate entities or political subdivisions), except to the extent the borrower has committed fraud or waste upon the property.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	The enactment of AB 2325 in 2010 requires foreclosure consultants register and become certificated by the Department of Justice.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	The definition of foreclosure consultant includes one who arranges or attempts to arrange for the audit of any obligation secured by a lien on a residence in foreclosure.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	The enactment of SB1427 in 2010 provides that prior to imposing a fine or penalty for failure to maintain a vacant property in California that is subject to a notice of default or that has been purchased at a foreclosure sale or acquired through foreclosure under a mortgage or deed of trust that a governmental entity shall provide the owner of that property with a notice of violation and an opportunity to correct the violation.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	The enactment of AB329 in 2009, the Reverse Mortgage Elder Protection Act of 2009 prohibits a lender or any other person who participates in the origination of the mortgage from participation in, being associated with, or employing any party that participates in or is associated with any other financial or insurance activity or referring a prospective borrower to anyone for the purchase of other financial or insurance products; and imposes certain disclosure requirements on the lender.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	The enactment of AB1160 in 2009, requires a supervised financial institution in California that negotiates primarily in any of a number of specified languages in the course of entering into a contract or agreement for a loan or extension of credit secured by residential real property, to deliver, prior to the execution of the contract or agreement, and no later than 3 business days after receiving the written application, a specified form in that language summarizing the terms of the contract or agreement; provides for administrative penalties for violations; and requires the California Department of Corporations and the Department of Financial Institutions to create a form for providing translations and make it available in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	The statute became operative on July 1, 2010, or 90 days after issuance of the form, whichever occurred later.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	The enactment of AB 1291 in 2009 makes changes to the California Unclaimed Property Law including (among other things): allowing electronic notification to customers who have consented to electronic notice; requiring that notices contain certain information and allow the holder to provide electronic means to enable the owner to contact the holder in lieu of returning the prescribed form to declare the owner s intent; authorizing the holder to give additional notices; and requiring, beginning January 1, 2011, a banking or financial organization to provide a written notice regarding escheat at the time a new account or safe deposit box is opened.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	The enactment of SB306 makes specified changes to clarify existing law related to filing a notice of default on residential real property in California, including (among other things): clarifying that the provisions apply to mortgages and deeds of trust recorded from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, secured by owner-occupied 3 4 residential real property containing no more than 4 dwelling units; revising the declaration to be filed with the notice of default; specifying how the loan servicers have to maximize net present value under their pooling and servicing agreements applies to certain investors; specifying how and when the notice to residents of property subject to foreclosure is to be mailed; and extending the time during which the notice of sale must be recorded from 14 to 20 days.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	The bill also makes certain changes related to short-pay agreements and short-pay demand statements.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	On February 20, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger signed ABX2 7 and SBX2 7, which established the California Foreclosure Prevention Act.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	The California Foreclosure Prevention Act modifies the foreclosure process to provide additional time for borrowers to work out loan modifications while providing an exemption for mortgage loan servicers that have implemented a comprehensive loan modification program.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	Civil Code Section 2923.52 requires an additional 90 day period beyond the period already provided before a Notice of Sale can be given in order to allow all parties to pursue a loan modification to prevent foreclosure of loans meeting certain criteria identified in that section.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	A mortgage loan servicer who has implemented a comprehensive loan modification program may file an application for exemption from the provisions of Civil Code Section 2923.52.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	Approval of this application provides the mortgage loan servicer an exemption from the additional 90-day period before filing the Notice of Sale when foreclosing on real property covered by the new law.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	California Assembly Bill 1301 was signed by the Governor on July 16, 2008 and became law on January 1, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	Among other things, the bill eliminated unnecessary applications that consume time and resources of bank licensees and which in many cases are now perfunctory.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	All of current Article 5 Locations of Head Office of Chapter 3, and all of Chapter 4 Branch Offices, Other Places of Business and Automated Teller Machines were repealed.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	A new Chapter 4 Bank Offices was added.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S4	The new Chapter 4 requires notice to the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) the establishment of offices, rather than the current application process.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S5	Many of the current branch applications are perfunctory in nature and/or provide for a waiver of application.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S6	Banks, on an exception basis, may be subject to more stringent requirements as deemed necessary.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S7	As an example, new banks, banks undergoing a change in ownership and banks in less than satisfactory condition may be required to obtain prior approval from the DFI before establishing offices if such activity is deemed to create an issue of safety and soundness.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S8	The bill eliminated unnecessary provisions in the Banking Law that are either outdated or have become undue restrictions to bank licensees.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S9	Chapter 6 Powers and Miscellaneous Provisions was repealed.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P152_S10	A new Chapter 6 Restrictions and Prohibited Practices was added.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	This chapter brings together restrictions in bank activities as formerly found in Chapter 18 Prohibited Practices and Penalties.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	However, in bringing the restrictions into the new chapter, various provisions were updated to remove the need for prior approval by the DFI Commissioner.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	The bill renumbered current Banking Law sections to align like sections.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P153_S3	Chapter 4.5 Authorizations for Banks was added.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	The purpose of the chapter is to provide exceptions to certain activities that would otherwise be prohibited by other laws outside of the Financial Code.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	The bill added Article 1.5 Loan and Investment Limitations to Chapter 10 Commercial Banks.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	This article is new in concept and acknowledges that investment decisions are business decisions so long as there is a diversification of the investments to spread any risk.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P156_S1	The risk is diversified in this article by placing a limitation on the loans and investments that can be made to any one entity.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	This section is a trade-off for elimination of applications to the DFI for approval of investments in securities, which were repealed.
1168455_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	Other changes AB 1301 made to the Banking Law:
1168455_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	Enabled the DFI to take action against a person who has engaged in or participated in any unsafe or unsound act with regard to a bank, including a former employee who has left the bank.

1168455_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	The decline in rental expense during 2010 resulted from the purchase of our Redding branch building on March 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with accounting principals we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_11_ITEM2_P2_S4	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in rental expense.
1168455_11_ITEM2_P2_S5	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2011 and the last such lease expiring during 2015.

1168455_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	For additional information related to the above plans see Note 12 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	There were no purchases of Plumas Bancorp common stock by the Company during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Compensation cost is recognized for all stock based awards that vest subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value of the awards.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We believe this is a critical accounting estimate since the grant-date fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula, which involves making estimates of the assumptions used, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility over the option term, expected dividend yield over the option term and risk-free interest rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, when determining the compensation expense to amortize over the vesting period, management makes estimates about the expected forfeiture rate of options.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our Company continues to be affected by an economic downturn unprecedented in recent memory.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, the effect of this downturn on operations lessened in 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Company recorded net income of $971 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.1 million from a net loss of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and up $667 thousand from net income of $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our provision for loan losses was still significantly elevated from historical norms at $5.5 million, but was down $9 million from 2009 levels.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	Additionally our provision for losses on OREO declined by $4.4 million from $4.8 million in 2009 to $356 thousand during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S5	We also benefited from a $2.8 million increase in non-interest income primarily related to a $1.4 million gain on the sale of our merchant processing portfolio and $1.2 million in gains on sale of investments.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S6	Non-interest expense, exclusive of the provision for OREO losses, declined by $2.7 million with reductions of $1.3 million in salary and benefits, $663 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense and $691 thousand in all other non-interest expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S7	Partially offsetting these items was a decline in net interest income of $1.6 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S8	The result was pretax income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S9	This compares to a pretax loss of $15.9 million in 2009 and pretax income of $92 thousand in 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P17_S10	We recorded a provision for income taxes of $389 thousand compared to tax benefits of $6.8 million in 2009 and $212 thousand in 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders increased from a net loss of $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 to net income of $287 thousand during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income (loss) allocable to common shareholders is calculated by subtracting dividends accrued and discount amortized on preferred stock from net income (loss).
1168455_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2010 decreased $43.6 million, or 8.3% to $484 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Decreases include $24.9 million in investment securities, $16.3 million in net loans, $2.4 million in real estate and vehicles acquired through foreclosure.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Net loans totaled $307.1 million at December 31, 2010, down 5% from $323.4 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	At December 31, 2010 investment securities totaled $63.0 million compared to $87.9 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Investment securities are mostly composed of debt securities issued by agencies of the U.S. Government.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Decreases of $6.1 million in interest-bearing demand (NOW) accounts, $5.0 million in time deposits, $1.9 million in money market accounts and $0.2 million in non-interest bearing demand accounts were, somewhat offset by an increase of $4.8 million in savings accounts, for a total decrease of $8.4 million, or 1.9%, to $424.9 million at December 31, 2010 from $433.3 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	During 2009 the Company had been successful in increasing its interest-bearing demand accounts as a result of a new interest bearing transaction account designed for local public agencies, which was successfully marketed to several of the municipalities in our service area.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	While this account was very successful in generating deposits, we determined that we needed to reduce the rate paid to increase the profitability of the product.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The decline in NOW accounts relates to an $8 million decline in balances from this product from $37.8 million at December 31, 2009 to $29.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Beginning in June of 2009 and ending in April of 2010 we offered a promotional time deposit with an 18-month term and a 2% rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decline in time deposits is mostly related to maturities from this product.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Time deposits are expected to continue to decline in 2011 as these promotional deposits mature, although we do expect a significant portion of these deposits to remain with the Bank reinvested in other deposit products.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	At December 31, 2010 we had $53 million in these promotional time deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Total borrowings at December 31, 2009 were $40 million, while no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Borrowings at December 31, 2009 consisted of $10 million in a two-year term FHLB advance, $10 million in a three-year term FHLB advance and $20 million in a six-month FHLB advance which matured on January 19, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	We chose to prepay both of the long-term borrowings during July 2010 incurring a prepayment penalty as we had significant excess liquidity and no longer projected a need for these borrowings.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Shareholders equity as of December 31, 2010 decreased by $243 thousand to $38.0 million down from $38.2 million as of December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	This decrease was related to a decrease of $674 thousand in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss from income of $622 thousand at December 31, 2009 to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $52 thousand at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The return (loss) on average assets was 0.19% for 2010, up from (1.87) % for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The return (loss) on average common equity was 1.1% for 2010, up from (29.5) % for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders equity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Average nonaccrual loan balances of $18.8 million for 2010, $25.1 million for 2009 and $5.2 million for 2008 are included in average loan balances for computational purposes.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Loan origination fees and costs are included in interest income as adjustments of the loan yields over the life of the loan using the interest method.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Loan interest income includes net loan costs of $20,000, $214,000 and $288,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decline of $1.6 million, or 8.6%, from $19.2 million for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The overall change in net interest income was primarily a result of a decrease of $1.8 million in loan interest income, due to a decline in average loans outstanding.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Additionally, interest on investments securities declined by $391 thousand, related to a decrease in yield.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Partially offsetting these decreases in interest income was a decline in rates paid on the company s deposits and borrowings.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest income decreased $2.2 million, or 9.4%, to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Interest and fees on loans decreased by $1.8 million from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $18.9 million for 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	The average loan balances were $323.9 million for 2010, down $30.6 million from the $354.5 million for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	The decline in loan balances is consistent with the decrease in economic activity in the Company s service area and the Company s successful effort to reduce its exposure to real estate construction and land development loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P41_S4	The average yields on loans were 5.82% for 2010 down slightly from the 5.83% for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest on investment securities decreased by $391 thousand, as a decrease in yield of 83 basis points was partially offset by an increase in average investment securities of $5.3 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Deposit rates in the Bank s service area continued to decline in 2010 resulting in a decline in interest expense on deposits of $473 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $3.2 million for 2009 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	All deposit products experienced rate declines in 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Interest expense on NOW accounts decreased by $289 thousand related to a decrease in the average rate paid on these accounts.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 30 basis points from 0.68% during 2009 to 0.38% during 2010 as we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Although we lost some deposits by lowering this rate; we currently are more focused on the profitability of the public sweep accounts rather than the amount of deposits we can generate from this source.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $125 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 31 basis points from 0.83% during the year ended December 31, 2009 to 0.52% during the current year.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	This was primarily related to a significantly drop in the rates paid on our money market sweep product.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest on time deposits declined by $55 thousand as an increase in average balance was offset by a decline in rate paid.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, the Company s average time deposits increased by $19.5 million from $105.3 million for 2009 to $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The increase in time deposits is related to a promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.96% during 2009 to 1.61% during the current year.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates in the Company s service area.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Interest on borrowings increased by $28 thousand related to an increase in the rate paid on borrowings as we chose to extend the term of our borrowings; however, this was partially offset by a $59 thousand decline in interest paid on junior subordinated debentures.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest expense on long-term borrowings increased by $103 thousand to $130 thousand for year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	We chose to prepay these borrowings during July 2010 as we had significant excess liquidity and no longer projected a need for these long-term borrowings.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	We incurred a $226 thousand prepayment penalty on these advances which we anticipate will be more than offset by future savings in interest expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest on short-term borrowings decreased by $75 thousand to $5 thousand related to a decline in average balance of $23.3 million from $24.3 million during 2009 to $986 thousand during the current period.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Interest expense paid on junior subordinated debentures, which fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate, decreased by $59 thousand during 2010 as a result of a decrease in the LIBOR rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2010 decreased 28 basis points to 4.24%, from 4.52% for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decline of $895 thousand, or 4.5%, from $20.1 million for 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decline in interest income and expense includes the affect of a decline in market interest rates during the comparison periods as illustrated by the decline in the average prime interest rate from 5.09% during 2008 to 3.25% for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Additionally, interest earned on the Company s loan portfolio declined related to an increase in average nonaccrual loans from $5.2 million during the 2008 period to $25.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Overall changes in net interest income are primarily a result of a decrease in loan interest income, largely due to the decline in yields earned, partially offset by an increase in interest on investments securities, related to an increase in average investment securities outstanding and decreases in interest expense on deposits, short-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures primarily due to the decline in the average rates paid.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Interest income decreased $2.6 million, or 10.2%, to $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Interest and fees on loans decreased by $2.9 million from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $20.7 million for 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	The average loan balances were $354.5 million for 2009, down $0.9 million from the $355.4 million for 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	The average yields on loans were 5.83% for 2009 down from the 6.63% for 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	In addition to the decline in yield related to a decline in market interest rates, loan yields for 2009 reflect the impact from an increase in the balance of average nonaccrual loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $276 thousand, as a decrease in yield of 66 basis points was offset by an increase in average investment securities of $17.4 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The decrease in rate for 2009 relates to the purchase of securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and the maturity of higher rate securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	As a result of the declining rate environment, interest expense decreased $1.7 million to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $5.4 million for 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to rate decreases on time deposits and, to a lesser extent, rate decreases on interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings and money market deposits, short-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in expense related to declining rates was slightly offset by increases in the average balances of interest bearing demand deposits and short-term borrowings.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008, the Company s average rate paid on time deposits decreased 120 basis points to 1.96% from 3.16%.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates in the Company s service area.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	During the same period the average balances of time deposits declined by $5.4 million to $105.3 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Interest expense on time deposits declined by $1.4 million from $3.5 million during 2008 to $2.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increased by $123 thousand related to an increase in the average balance of these deposits from $73.3 million during 2008 to $98.4 million during 2009 partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on these accounts from 0.75% during 2008 to 0.68% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in interest-bearing demand accounts primary relates to a new interest bearing transaction account designed for local public agencies, which we have successfully marketed to several of the municipalities in our service area.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $34 thousand related to an increase in the average balance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The rate paid on these accounts was 0.83% during both periods as a decline in market interest rates was offset by the introduction of a new corporate sweep product which offers a tiered rate structure that rewards customers with a higher rate for maintaining larger balances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	Interest on savings deposits declined by $71 thousand related to a decline in rate paid from 0.33% during 2008 to 0.18% during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Interest on short-term borrowings decreased by $122 thousand as a decline in the rate paid on these borrowings of 137 basis points was partially offset by an increase of $12.4 million in average balance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Interest expense paid on junior subordinated debentures, which fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate, decreased by $252 thousand during 2009 as a result of a decrease in the LIBOR rate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2009 decreased 47 basis points to 4.52%, from 4.99% for 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.5 million down $9.0 million from the $14.5 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 and $12.2 million during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 3.43% during 2009 to 2.39% during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	While we incurred significant charge-offs during the 2010 period, $3.1 million of the charge-offs had been incorporated in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2009 as specific reserves on impaired loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	The allowance for loan losses totaled $7.3 million at December 31, 2010 and $9.6 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S5	The decrease in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2009 is attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in specific reserves related to impaired loans from $4.3 million at December 31, 2009 to $1.9 million at December 31, 2010 and a decrease of $30.6 million in average loan balances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S6	General reserves increased by $133 thousand to $5.4 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S7	Related to the decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 2.88% at December 31, 2009 to 2.33% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P64_S8	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans increased from 1.69% at December 31, 2009 to 1.90% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	See the section Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 non-interest income increased by $2.8 million to $8.6 million, from $5.8 million during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	This increase was primarily related to three items, the largest of which was a $1.4 million gain on the sale of our merchant processing portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	During June 2010 we entered into an alliance with a world-wide merchant processing leader.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	In conjunction with this alliance we sold our merchant processing business, recording a one-time gain of $1.4 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	The Company believes that this alliance provides our customers with a superior merchant processing solution.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	Additionally we sold securities having a book value of $39.7 million, recording a gain on sale of $1.2 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	We chose to sell substantially our entire municipal securities portfolio as part of our overall asset/liability management strategy and related to the favorable market price for these securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S5	In addition, we sold $28.9 million in U.S. government agency securities to lock in significant gains that were available on these securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S6	Finally, we recorded a gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million representing the sale of $13.6 million in loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S7	Additional SBA government guaranteed loans totaling $4.3 million were sold during the fourth quarter; however, the gain on sale generated will not be recorded until the 90-day premium recourse period on SBA loan sales has expired.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P68_S8	During the first quarter of 2011, assuming no premiums are refunded, related to these loan sales the Company will recognize a gain on sale of approximately $338 thousand; however, it will also incur commission expense of approximately $106 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Loan service fees increased by $56 thousand to $195 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Loan service fees are primarily related to fees earned for servicing the sold portion of SBA loans and the increase in this category is consistent with the increase in sold SBA loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $154 thousand primarily related to a decline in overdraft fees as new regulations placed additional restrictions on the Bank in charging overdraft fees on ATM and Point of Sale transactions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Merchant processing fees declined by $141 thousand related to the sale of our merchant processing portfolio in June.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	During 2009, total non-interest income increased by $661 thousand or 13%, to $5.8 million, up from $5.1 million from the comparable period in 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	This increase was primarily related to two items: (i) during the 2008 period non-interest income was adversely affected by an other than temporary impairment write down of $415 thousand on a security issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 and; (ii) during 2009 we increased our gain on sale of SBA government guaranteed loans by $482 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	In addition, other income increased by $80 thousand and loan servicing fees increased by $43 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Gains on loan sales are related to the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in loan sale gains include an increase in loans sold from $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 to $10.8 million during 2009, increases in the market price of SBA guaranteed loans and an increase, during 2009, in the percentage of each loan that is guaranteed by the SBA.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Partially offsetting these increases in income were declines of $155 thousand in service charges and $151 thousand in other income including declines in investment services income, official check fees and FHLB dividends.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in service charge income is related to a decline in NSF/overdraft income.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	Investment services income decreased by $44 thousand; however, the Company offset this decrease by a decrease in staffing dedicated to this department.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	The Company attributes these decreases primarily to the economic conditions present during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P73_S4	Official checks fees declined by $76 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Official checks fees represent fees paid by a third party processor for the processing of our cashier and expense checks.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	These fees are indexed to the federal funds rate and the decrease in income from this item is primarily related to the decline in the federal funds rate during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Additionally, during 2008 the processor changed the fee structure further reducing fees that we earn under this relationship.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	The FHLB paid only one dividend totaling $4 thousand during 2009 compared to four quarterly dividends totaling $105 thousand during 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We continue to focus on cost control initiatives which have resulted in savings in most categories of non-interest expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Additionally, during the second quarter of 2010 we performed an extensive analysis of our personnel requirements throughout the organization and based on this analysis we were able to reduce our head count by approximately 10% which has resulted in significant savings in salary and benefits during the second half of 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2010, total non-interest expense decreased by $7.1 million, or 27%, to $19.2 million, down from $26.3 million for the comparable period in 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	This decrease in non-interest expense was primarily the result of savings in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional fees, provision for OREO losses and a reduction in losses on the sale of OREO.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	These items and other reductions were partially offset by increases in outside service fees, OREO carrying expenses and insurance expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $1.3 million primarily related to four items.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	Salary expense, excluding commissions, declined by $796 thousand related to a reduction in staffing in all areas with the exception of government guaranteed lending and problem assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	While the Company has reduced personnel in most functional areas, we have increased staffing in our problem asset department to effectively manage our increased level of nonperforming assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	Additionally, we have increased staffing in our government guaranteed lending department as we see continued opportunities for loan growth in this area.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	Commission expense, which relates to government guaranteed lending personnel and is included in salary expense, increased by $152 thousand resulting from the increase in government guaranteed loan sales.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	Stock compensation expense decreased by $199 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	During the first quarter of 2010 we recorded an adjustment to the estimated forfeiture rate associated with option expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	Finally, we have eliminated discretionary bonuses in 2010 resulting in a decrease in bonus expense of $269 thousand and during the second quarter of 2010 we discontinued the company matching contributions to our 401k plan saving $172 thousand during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The decline in occupancy and equipment expense primarily relates to the savings realized from the purchase of our Redding branch.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	On March 31, 2010 we purchased the building housing our Redding branch at a cost of $1.0 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with accounting principals we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in occupancy costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	In addition to the one-time savings from the reversal of accrued rent we benefit from reduced operating costs on this building as the owner rather than a renter.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S5	Occupancy costs also benefited from a milder winter resulting in reduced utility and snow removal costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P80_S6	Equipment costs benefited from a $153 thousand reduction in depreciation expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Professional fees were abnormally high during 2009 related to consulting costs associated with our computer network and telephone system.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	The decrease in profession fees includes a $157 thousand reduction in consulting costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Losses on the sale of OREO and other vehicles owned (OVO) totaled $158 thousand during 2009; however, during 2010 we recorded $43 thousand net gains on sale of OREO.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	During 2009 we experienced a significant decline in the value of many of our OREO properties requiring a $4.8 million loss provision; however, this decline in value slowed significantly in 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	During 2010 our provision for OREO losses declined by $4.4 million to $356 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Other reductions in expense include savings in FDIC insurance, telephone, loan collection costs, business development, advertising, director expense, courier expense, director expenses, supplies costs and other.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	In total these costs were down $789 thousand for 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Outside service fees increased by $222 thousand related to the outsourcing of daily management of our computer network operations and the installation of a new internet banking platform.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	OREO carrying expenses increased by $203 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Insurance expense, as more fully described below, was abnormally low in 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, total non-interest expense increased by $5.9 million, or 29%, to $26.4 million, up from $20.5 million for the comparable period in 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	This increase in non-interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the provision for OREO losses of $4.2 million and an increase in FDIC insurance assessments of $867 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	Other significant increases included $170 thousand in salaries and employee benefits, $187 thousand in outside service fees, $101 thousand in professional fees, $194 thousand in loan collection costs, $195 thousand in OREO costs, $158 thousand in losses on the sale of OREO and $395 thousand in other expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	These items were partially offset by reductions in other costs, the three largest of which where advertising and shareholder relations, business development and insurance expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for declines in value.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	The provision for OREO losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $4.8 million which represents significant declines in the value of several properties.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	At December 31, 2009 OREO consisted of twenty-nine properties with a total fair value, which includes a $5.1 million valuation allowance, of $11.2 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	At December 31, 2008 OREO consisted of nineteen properties with a fair value of $4.1 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	During 2009 the FDIC increased regular assessments and implemented a special assessment resulting in a significant increase in FDIC assessments.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	Additionally, during the first quarter of 2008 the Company was able to use its remaining credit balance with the FDIC to offset insurance premium billings; however, by the end of the first quarter of 2008 the credit balance had been fully utilized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company is currently forecasting elevated FDIC insurance premiums for next several years.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Salaries and other employee benefits increased by $170 thousand primarily related to a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Salary expense increased by $21 thousand as an increase in salary expense of $296 thousand related to our government guaranteed lending operations was mostly offset by reductions in staffing in other areas including our Reno loan production office and our branch network.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	Related to a decrease in loan production, the deferral of loan origination cost, which reduces salary and benefits cost, declined by $160 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company outsourced the oversight of its computer network, resulting in a reduction in information technology staffing.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The cost of this outsourcing is included in the increase in outside services fees.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	In addition, during 2009 we implemented an outsourced online banking product which also increased outside service fees.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Consistent with the increase in nonperforming loans and assets during the period (See the section Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses ) loan collection costs and OREO expenses increased by $389 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	OREO costs which include the cost of holding and maintaining foreclosed real estate increased by $195 thousand to $370 thousand while loan collection costs increased by $194 thousand to $399 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Losses incurred on the sale of OREO totaled $158 thousand and relate to the sale of nine properties.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	Proceeds received on sale of these properties totaled $2.0 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The increase in other expense, which totaled $395 thousand, is primarily related to nonrecurring expense items, the largest of which totaled $140 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We implemented cost control initiatives which, among other things, have resulted in savings in advertising, shareholder relation costs and business development costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	These cost savings totaled $255 thousand during 2009 when compared to 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	We reduced our shareholder expense by eliminating the glossy section of our annual report.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	Business development costs declined as we reduced certain employee travel and relationship-building initiatives which generated an annual savings of approximately $75 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	During the first quarter of 2009 our Chief Information and Technology officer retired from the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Because his retirement took place prior to the age of sixty-five he forfeited his benefits under his company provided split dollar life insurance plan.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	To reflect this forfeiture we recorded a one-time reduction in insurance expense totaling $83 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $389 thousand, or 28.6% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The percentage for 2010 differs from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal loan and investment income decrease taxable income.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	During 2009 the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.8 million, or 42.6% of pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	These commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company s largest lending categories are real estate mortgage loans, consumer and agricultural loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	These categories accounted for approximately 51.7%, 15.5% and 12.2%, respectively of the Company s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010, and approximately 48.5%, 16.4% and 12.5%, respectively of the Company s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	Additionally, construction and land development loans represented 9.9% and 11.4% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio reflects management s efforts to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans in 2010 and 2009 due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 80% and 77% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 66% and 68%, respectively, of the Company s loan portfolio was compromised of variable rate loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $38 million and $42 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors The Board s Loan Committee reviews the asset quality of new loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P109_S4	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	It consists of members of executive management, credit administration management and the Board of Directors, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The federal financial regulatory agencies in December 2006 issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	When determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company follows these guidelines.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	The policy statement revises and replaces a 1993 policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	The agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	The policy statement was also revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and post-1993 supervisory guidance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	The policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing, maintaining and documenting a comprehensive, systematic, and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature, scope, and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP, the institution s stated policies and procedures, management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	The policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio, and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	The policy statement states that prudent, conservative, but not excessive, loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	No. 102, which represents the SEC staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the Commission s interpretations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	The Company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements, which include but are not limited to:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	specific allocation determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 Receivables (formerly FAS 114, Accounting for Impairment of a loan ) based on probable losses on specific loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (formerly SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ), based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified, impaired, and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	For purposes of this analysis, loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are Watch , substandard , doubtful , and loss .
1168455_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Watch loans are currently performing but are potentially weak, as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends, which if not corrected, could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses which, if not corrected, could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	A loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Classified loans, as defined by the Company, include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Loans classified as loss are immediately charged off.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Loans are consistently monitored against risk rating criteria.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	As loans are identified that may warrant a classification change, they are discussed with the Company s credit administration officers and appropriate risk grades are assigned.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	There are several times in the life of a loan that this occurs:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	If weaknesses (or improvements) are noted, a change in risk rating, if warranted by credit administration, will be made.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	Loans classified Watch or below in an amount of $100,000 or more will be individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the Bank s policy for determining and measuring impairment under FAS 114.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Effective for the third quarter of 2010, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	This modification incorporated historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter to identified pools of loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	This modification did not have a material affect on the Company s allowance for loans losses or provision for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.5 million down $9.0 million from the $14.5 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 and $12.2 million during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 3.43% during 2009 to 2.39% during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P133_S3	While we incurred significant charge-offs during the 2010 period, $3.1 million of the charge-offs had been incorporated in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2009 as specific reserves on impaired loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	We currently anticipate that net charge-offs could range from approximately $3.5 million to $5.5 million in 2011, the largest part of which are anticipated to be related to real estate loans and consistent with 2010 activity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	For other categories of loans we expect charge-offs to be similar to 2010 activity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	However, given the lack of stability in the real estate market and the recent volatility in charge-offs, there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not increase or decrease from this estimate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	The allowance for loan losses totaled $7.3 million at December 31, 2010 and $9.6 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	The decrease in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2009 is attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in specific reserves related to impaired loans from $4.3 million at December 31, 2009 to $1.9 million at December 31, 2010 and a decrease of $30.6 million in average loan balances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	General reserves increased by $133 thousand to $5.4 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P135_S3	Related to the decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 2.88% at December 31, 2009 to 2.33% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P135_S4	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans increased from 1.69% at December 31, 2009 to 1.90% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	Where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled $2.0 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	There were no troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010 were $25.4 million, an increase of $11.1 million from the $14.3 million balance at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	Of the total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010, fifteen loans had principal balances ranging from $4.7 million to $570 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	In total these loans amount to $19.1 million representing 76% of the nonaccrual balance of $25.3 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S3	Specific reserves of $1.0 million were allocated to these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S4	For all nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 specific reserves totaled $1.8 million or 7% of total nonaccrual loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P145_S5	Additionally, the nonaccrual balances at December 31, 2010 are net of $2.8 million in partial charge-offs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	At December 31, 2010 $13.3 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $28.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The increases in impaired and nonperforming loans mostly relates to two large relationships totaling $8.1 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	These loans were measured for impairment and it was determined that a $600 thousand specific allowance was required at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $1.9 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S4	Additionally, $2.8 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S5	This compares to $1.0 that had been charged off against impaired loans at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P147_S6	The average recorded investment in impaired loans was $20.8 million, $25.1 million, $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	In most cases, the Company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $608 thousand, $369 thousand and $74 thousand, respectively, of income on such loans.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	Interest foregone on impaired loans totaled $1,021 thousand $568, thousand and $576 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2010 is appropriate.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P149_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P149_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	Repossessed assets and OREO are carried at fair market value, less selling costs.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S3	OREO holdings represented thirty-one properties totaling $8.9 million at December 31, 2010 and twenty-nine properties totaling $11.2 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S4	Of the thirty-one properties, three properties represent 84% of the balance or $7.5 million of the $8.9 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S5	These three properties were transferred into OREO during the third quarter of 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P150_S6	We have actively marketed the properties and while we have received offers for each property, to date none have been accepted by the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 7.07% at December 31, 2010 up from 4.84% at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	Total investment securities decreased by $25 million from $88.0 million at December 31, 2009 to $63.0 million as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P153_S2	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2010 or 2009; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the FRB totaling $52.3 million and $18.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P153_S3	These balances currently earn 25 basis points.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	The investment portfolio balances in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Government agencies, and municipal obligations comprised 2%, 98% and less than 1%, respectively, at December 31, 2010 versus 1%, 86% and 13%, respectively, at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	During 2010 we chose to sell substantially our entire municipal securities portfolio as part of our overall asset/liability management strategy related to credit quality concerns and the favorable market price for these securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	In addition, we sold $28.9 million in U.S. government agency securities to lock in significant gains that were available on these securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P154_S3	The total proceeds received from the sale of municipal and agency securities were $40.9 million including a $1.2 million gain on sale.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	During 2009 we increased our level of agency securities primarily to support our growth in public agency sweep account deposits which require the pledging of investment securities for balances in excess of those covered by FDIC insurance.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	While this account was very successful in generating deposits, we determined that we needed to reduce the rate paid to increase the profitability of the product, resulting in a decline in balances from this product from $37.8 million at December 31, 2009 to $29.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P155_S2	The decrease in investment securities between periods includes the affect of lowered pledging requirements, the sale of municipal securities and market rate considerations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	The Company s investments in mortgage-backed securities of U.S. Government agencies provide interest income as well as cash flows for liquidity and reinvestment opportunities as these securities pay down.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	At December 31, 2010, total balances in these mortgage-backed securities were $21.3 million up from $19.3 million at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	Although these pass-through securities typically have final maturities of between ten and fifteen years, the pass-through nature of principal payments from the prepayment or refinance of loans underlying these securities is expected to significantly reduce their average life.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P157_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	At December 31, 2009 the Company transferred all of its municipal securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale as it was determined that management no longer had the intent to hold these investments to maturity.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	Total deposits were $424.9 million as of December 31, 2010, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 2%, from the December 31, 2009 balance of $433.3 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	Declines of $6.1 million in interest bearing transaction accounts (NOW), $1.9 million in money market accounts, $5.0 million in time deposits and $0.2 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits was partially offset by an increase of $4.8 million in savings accounts.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	The decline in NOW accounts relates to an $8 million decline in balances in our public sweep account from $37.8 million at December 31, 2009 to $29.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S1	There were only minor changes in the composition of our deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S2	Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 26% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S3	Interest bearing transaction accounts were 24% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 25% at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S4	Money market and savings deposits totaled 22% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 21% at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P162_S5	Time deposits were 28% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P163_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains secured borrowing arrangements with the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P164_S2	Included in time deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $2 million and $5 million, respectively in CDARS reciprocal time deposits which, under regulatory guidelines, are classified as brokered deposits.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P164_S3	The Company did not hold brokered deposits during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2010:
1168455_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company s local business and individual customer base.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P166_S1	The potential impact on the Company s liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company s asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $91,408,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $150,217,000.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company held $2,188,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $46,561,000.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P167_S5	To borrow the $91,408,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,108,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	In addition, the Company has the ability to secure advances through the FRB discount window.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	These advances also must be collateralized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Short-term borrowings at December 31, 2009 consisted of a $20 million FHLB advance at 0.47% which matured on January 19, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	No borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	The average balance in short-term borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $986 thousand and $24.3 million, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P170_S1	The average rate paid on these borrowings was 0.51% during 2010 and 0.33% during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P170_S2	The maximum amount of short-term borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2010 and 2009 was zero and $33.8 million, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	Long-term borrowings at December 31, 2009 consisted of two $10 million FHLB advances.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	The first advance was scheduled to mature on November 23, 2011 and bore interest at 1.00%.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S2	The second advance was scheduled to mature on November 23, 2012 and bore interest at 1.60%.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S3	We chose to prepay both of these borrowings during July 2010 as we had significant excess liquidity and no longer projected a need for these long-term borrowings.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S4	We incurred a $226 thousand prepayment penalty on these advances which we anticipate will be more than offset by future savings in interest expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P171_S5	No long-term borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	Shareholders equity as of December 31, 2010 totaled $38.0 million down slightly from $38.2 million as of December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	On January 30, 2009, under the Capital Purchase Program, the Company sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Shares ) and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $7.54 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P173_S1	Ten million of the twelve million in proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock was injected into Plumas Bank providing addition capital for the bank to support growth in loans and investment securities and strengthen its capital ratios.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P173_S2	The remainder provides funds for holding company activities and general corporate purposes.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors (the Board).
1168455_11_ITEM7_P175_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P175_S2	No common cash dividends were paid in 2009 or 2010 and none are anticipated to be paid in 2011.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P176_S1	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters and note 12 Shareholders Equity Dividend Restrictions of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities and suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P177_S1	Therefore, Plumas Bancorp is currently in arrears with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock and interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the related documentation.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P177_S2	As of December 31, 2010 the amount of the arrearage on the dividend payments of the Series A Preferred Stock is $449 thousand and the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $233 thousand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P177_S3	Although we have sufficient cash and liquidity to pay these amounts, we are taking these actions to support holding company cash and preserve our capital position.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	The Company s significantly increased its regulatory capital ratios during 2010 related both to an increase in regulatory capital as illustrated in the below table and a decrease in its fourth quarter average assets (used in Leverage Ratio) and risk based assets (used in Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios).
1168455_11_ITEM7_P178_S1	Adjusted fourth quarter average assets declined by $32 million and the Company s risk based assets declined by $52 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, with risk-based capital ratios calculated separately for the Company and the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S2	The Company s capital position at December 31, 2010 exceeded minimum thresholds established by industry regulators, and by current regulatory definitions the Bank is well capitalized, the highest rating of the categories defined under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S3	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S4	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S5	There are two categories of capital under the guidelines: Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders equity, and qualifying trust-preferred securities (including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other deductions, notably the unrealized net gains or losses (after tax adjustments) on available-for-sale investment securities carried at fair market value; Tier 2 capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P179_S6	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	As noted previously, the Company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate $10 million in trust-preferred securities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P180_S1	These trust-preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed 25% of total Tier 1 capital, but are classified as long-term debt in accordance with GAAP.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust-preferred securities (and/or related subordinated debentures) in the Tier I capital of bank holding companies.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P181_S1	However, under the final rule, after a five-year transition period goodwill must be deducted from Tier I capital prior to calculating the 25% limitation.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P181_S2	Generally, the amount of junior subordinated debentures in excess of the 25% Tier 1 limitation is included in Tier 2 capital.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	On March 23, 2009 the requirement to deduct goodwill was delayed until March 31, 2011.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands except percentage amounts).
1168455_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all their capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	On March 16, 2011, the Bank entered into a Consent Order ( Order ) with the FDIC and the DFI.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P185_S1	Within 240 days of the date of the Order we are required to increase and maintain the Bank s Tier 1 capital to a level such that its leverage ratio is at least 10% and its total risk-based capital is at least 13%.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P185_S2	Currently the Bank has exceeded the Order s total risk-based capital ratio goal of 13% and Management expects to achieve the leverage ratio target of 10% by year-end without the injection of any new capital.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to the Order.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P187_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized leverage, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of 5%, 6% and 10%, respectively, at all times.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $71.6 million in unfunded loan commitments and $164 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S3	This compares to $67.3 million in unfunded commitments and $304 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S4	Of the $71.6 million in unfunded loan commitments, $34.9 million and $36.7 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2010, $35.8 million were secured by real estate, of which $8.9 million was secured by commercial real estate and $26.9 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P189_S7	Since, some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	The Company leases one depository branch, one lending office and one loan administration office and two non branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases, including premises, totaled $20,000 $317,000 and $347,000, in 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P190_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2011 and the last such lease expiring during 2015.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	The decline in rental expense during 2010 resulted from the purchase of our Redding branch building on March 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P191_S2	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with accounting principals we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P191_S3	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in rental expense.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P192_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P192_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio containing U.S. Government, agency and municipal securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P192_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $91,408,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $150,217,000.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company held $2,188,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $46,561,000.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S5	To borrow the $91,408,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,108,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S6	In addition, the Company has the ability to secure advances through the FRB discount window.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P193_S7	These advances also must be collateralized.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	Customer deposits are the Company s primary source of funds.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P194_S1	Total deposits were $424.9 million as of December 31, 2010, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 2%, from the December 31, 2009 balance of $433.3 million.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P195_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P195_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_11_ITEM7_P195_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.
1168455_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The following consolidated financial statements of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary, and report of the independent registered public accounting firm are included in the Annual Report of Plumas Bancorp to its shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operation, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	During 2002, Plumas Bancorp (the Company ) was incorporated as a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring Plumas Bank (the Bank ) in a one bank holding company reorganization.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation expansion and diversification.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I ( Trust I ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust II ( Trust II ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 28, 2005.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Bank operates eleven branches in California, including branches in Alturas, Chester, Fall River Mills, Greenville, Kings Beach, Portola, Quincy, Redding, Susanville, Tahoe City, and Truckee.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	In addition to its branch network, the Bank operates an administrative office in Reno, Nevada and a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Bank s primary source of revenue is generated from providing loans to customers who are predominately small and middle market businesses and individuals residing in the surrounding areas.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Bank s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to applicable legal limits.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Bank is participating in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Transaction Account Guarantee Program.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Under the program, through December 31, 2010, all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts were fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), which, in part, permanently raises the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Amendments related to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act now provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts beginning December 31, 2010 for an additional two year period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Effective March 16, 2011, in connection with the Bank s regularly scheduled 2010 Joint FDIC and California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) examination, the Bank entered into a Consent Order ( Order ) with the FDIC and the DFI.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	The FDIC and DFI in the Consent Order, require certain actions to be taken by the Bank including among others:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Not pay cash dividends to Plumas Bancorp without the prior written consent of the FDIC and DFI.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	One of Management s top priorities has and will continue to be to reduce its problem assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	The order serves to formalize and reinforce the Company s on-going plans to strengthen the Company s operations and to implement the Bank s strategic plan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	Currently the Bank has exceeded the Order s total risk-based capital ratio goal of 13% and Management expects to achieve the leverage ratio target of 10% by year-end without the injection of any new capital.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Bank s leverage ratio was 8.9% and total risk-based capital ratio was 14.0%.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Plumas Statutory Trust I and Trust II are not consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company s investment in Trust I of $275,000 and Trust II of $152,000 are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued and guaranteed by the Company and held by Trust I and Trust II are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances to conform to the classifications used in 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	As of December 31, 2010 all cash held with other federally insured institutions was fully insured by the FDIC.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	During 2009, management determined they no longer had the positive intent to hold their held-to-maturity securities and transferred their held-to-maturity securities to available- for-sale (see note 5).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	This transfer increases the Company s flexibility in managing its investment portfolio allowing the investments to be sold in implementing its asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	All transfers between categories are accounted for at fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P31_S3	There were no transfers between categories during 2010 or 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P33_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	The investment is carried at cost.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock totaled $2,188,000 and $1,933,000, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	On the consolidated balance sheet, Federal Home Loan Bank stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Included in the portfolio are loans which are 75% to 90% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	In the case of SBA loans, the Company may be required to refund a portion of the sales premium if the borrower defaults or prepays within ninety days of the settlement date.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	In accordance with new accounting standards for the sale of a portion of a loan, as more fully described in the Adoption of New Financial Accounting Standards section of this note, we have recorded the proceeds from the sale of the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that are subject to a premium refund obligation, which totaled $4,284,000, as a secured borrowing and included such secured borrowings in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Once the premium refund obligation has elapsed the transaction will be recorded as a sale with the guaranteed portions of loans and the secured borrowing removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain on sale recorded.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Included in commercial loans at December 31, 2010 is $4,284,000 in guaranteed portions of SBA loans sold subject to a 90-day premium refund obligation.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	In February 2011, the SBA eliminated the refund obligation period and the Company will no longer be required to defer gain recognition.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2010 the Company had $5,208,000 in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair vale and therefore maybe reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $33,686,000 and $18,512,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company also serviced loans previously sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) totaling $2,185,000 and $3,014,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at the difference between the contractual servicing fees and adequate compensation for performing the servicing, and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	Servicing assets are periodically evaluated for impairment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on current market interest rates.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	For purposes of measuring impairment, servicing assets are stratified based on note rate and term.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	The amount of impairment recognized, if any is the amount by which the servicing assets for a stratum exceed their fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan, the servicing asset, the interest-only (IO) strip, and the sold portion of the loan based on their relative fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S3	The servicing asset is recognized and amortized over the estimated life of the related loan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S4	Assets (accounted for as interest-only (IO) strips) are recorded at the fair value of the difference between note rates and rates paid to purchasers (the interest spread) and contractual servicing fees, if applicable.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S5	IO strips are carried at fair value with gains or losses recorded as a component of shareholders equity, similar to available-for-sale investment securities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P44_S6	Significant future prepayments of these loans will result in the recognition of additional amortization of related servicing assets and an adjustment to the carrying value of related IO strips.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Loans are stated at principal balances outstanding, except for loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale which are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectibility of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectibility of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P48_S4	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company s maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial and industrial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, installment loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of credit card receivables.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, which is included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically performs detailed reviews of all such loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses also consists of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described below.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Commercial Commercial loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than real estate portfolio segments because these loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Real estate Residential and Home Equity Lines of Credit The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P73_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P73_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Installment An installment loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of small loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Most installment loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business loans granted for the purchase of heavy equipment or industrial vehicles may also be included.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P76_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Other - Other loans primarily consist of automobile and credit card loans and are similar in nature to installment loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P78_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and California Department of Financial Institutions, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P78_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Other real estate relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $8,867,000 net of a valuation allowance of $4,188,000 at December 31, 2010 and $11,204,000 net of a valuation allowance of $5,066,000 at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	Proceeds from sales of other real estate totaled $3,462,000 and $1,992,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company recorded a gain on sale of other real estate of $43,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S3	This compares to a loss on sale of $158,000 during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S4	There were no sales of other real estate in 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S5	When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S6	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S7	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P82_S8	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are recorded in other income or expenses as incurred.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over ten years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	There were no such events or circumstances in 2010 or 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Premises and equipment are carried at cost.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P92_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P92_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders (net income or (loss) less preferred dividends) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P94_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had two shareholder approved stock-based compensation plans, the Plumas Bank 2001 and 1991 Stock Option Plans (the Plans ) which are described more fully in Note 12.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	Compensation expense, net of related tax benefits, recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $53,000, $237,000 and $269,000 or $0.01, $0.05 and $0.06 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company determines the fair value of the options previously granted on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P97_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P97_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-16 , Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (Statement 166) , which amends previously issued accounting guidance to enhance accounting and reporting for transfers of financial assets, including securitizations or continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	Prior to the issuance of Statement 166, transfers under participation agreements and other partial loan sales fell under the general guidance for transfers of financial assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	Statement 166 introduces a new definition for a participating interest along with the requirement for partial loan sales to meet the definition of a participating interest for sale treatment to occur.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S3	If a participation or other partial loan sale does not meet the definition, the portion sold should remain on the books and the proceeds recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S4	Additionally, existing provisions that require the transferred assets to be isolated from the originating institution (transferor), that the transferor does not maintain effective control through certain agreements to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets and that the purchasing institution (transferee) has the right to pledge or exchange the assets acquired were retained.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S5	The new provisions became effective on January 1, 2010 and early adoption was not permitted.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S6	Under this new standard, the Company s loan participations were not affected, but the Company deferred approximately $340,000 of gains and recorded $4,284,000 of secured borrowings related to the sale of a portion of certain loans as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P101_S7	These gains will be recognized when the warranty periods that precluded the sales from meeting the participating interest standard expire.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued FASB ASU 2010-06 , Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends and clarifies existing standards to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	Specifically, the standard requires disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers, the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3, and information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	This standard clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities previously separate fair value disclosures were required for each major category of assets and liabilities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	This standard also clarifies the requirement to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	Except for the requirement to disclose information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements on a gross basis, these disclosures are effective for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P103_S3	The requirement to separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of recurring Level 3 measurements becomes effective for the Company for the year beginning on January 1, 2011.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P103_S4	The Company adopted this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2010 and the impact of adoption was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued FASB ASU 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses .
1168455_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	ASU 2010-20 requires more robust and disaggregated disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables (loans) and allowances for loan losses, including disclosure about credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of finance receivables.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on and after December 15, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P104_S3	The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P104_S4	The adoption of this guidance has significantly expanded disclosure requirements related to accounting policies and disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses but did not have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operation or cash flows.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is estimated to be fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	Investment securities: For investment securities, fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities and indications of value provided by brokers.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	Loans: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	Fair values of loans held for sale, if any, are estimated using quoted market prices for similar loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P110_S2	The fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered at each reporting date for loans with similar terms to borrowers of comparable creditworthiness.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P110_S3	The fair value of loans is adjusted for the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P110_S4	The carrying value of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	The fair value of impaired loans is based on either the estimated fair value of underlying collateral or estimated cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective rate.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P111_S1	Assumptions regarding credit risk and cash flows are determined using available market information and specific borrower information.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	The carrying amount of FHLB stock approximates its fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	This investment is carried at cost and is redeemable at par with certain restrictions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	The fair values of bank owned life insurance policies are based on current cash surrender values at each reporting date provided by the insurers.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	Deposits: The fair values for demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date represented by their carrying amount.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates offered at each reporting date by the Bank for certificates with similar remaining maturities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P114_S2	The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	The carrying amount of the short-term borrowings approximates its fair value.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	The fair values for long-term FHLB term advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered at each reporting date for FHLB advances with a similar maturity.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair value of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures was determined based on the current market value for like kind instruments of a similar maturity and structure.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	For these commitments, there is no significant difference between the committed amounts and their fair values and therefore, these items are not included in the table above.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P128_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P132_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2010 or 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class of assets above.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of impaired loans is based on the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent or the present value of the expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective rate for those loans not collateral dependent.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	If the Company determines that the value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the carrying value is adjusted through a charge-off recorded through the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	Total losses of $1,356,000 and $5,127,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	The fair value of other real estate is based on property appraisals at the time of transfer and as appropriate thereafter, less estimated costs to sell.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	Estimated costs to sell other real estate were based on standard market factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P138_S2	Management periodically reviews other real estate to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or estimated fair value, net of estimated costs to sell.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $88,000 were recorded, net of $36,000 in tax benefit, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity at December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company sold sixty-five available-for-sale securities for $40,902,000, recording a $1,160,000 gain on sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $1,059,000 were recorded, net of $437,000 in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P141_S1	During 2009 we sold one available-for sale security for $86,000, recording a $1,000 gain on sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	Related to a significant deterioration in creditworthiness, during 2009 we sold five held-to maturity securities for $943,000, recording a $9,000 gain on sale.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P142_S2	At December 31, 2009 the Company transferred all of its obligations of states and political subdivisions from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale as it was determined that management no longer had the intent to hold these investments to maturity.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P142_S3	At the time of the transfer these securities had an amortized cost of $11,387,000 and a fair value of $11,722,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P142_S4	There were no sales or transfers of held-to-maturity investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2008.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	Investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	There were no securities in a loss position for more than one year as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company held 63 securities of which 22 were in a loss position.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P145_S1	Of the securities in a loss position, all were in a loss position for less than twelve months.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	Of the 22 securities 11 are U.S. government agencies, 9 are U.S. Government agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations and 2 are obligations of states and political subdivisions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	When analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the historical and implied volatility of the security; the financial condition of the issuer of the security; and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2010, management does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P148_S2	Based on the Company s evaluation of the above and other relevant factors, the Company does not believe the securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2010 are other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2010 by contractual maturity are shown below.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	Investment securities with amortized costs totaling $36,828,000 and $72,154,000 and estimated fair values totaling $36,814,000 and $73,254,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits, including public deposits and treasury, tax and loan accounts.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	Included in impaired loans are troubled debt restructurings.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	A troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan where the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P154_S2	The concessions may be granted in various forms, including reduction in the standard interest rate, reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest, and extension of the maturity date.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company held $2,188,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $46,561,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S4	To borrow the $91,408,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,108,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S5	In addition, the Company has the ability to secure advances through the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco discount window.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P164_S6	These advances also must be collateralized.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are Connecticut business trusts formed by the Company with capital of $275,000 and $152,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	Under applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust preferred securities that is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to twenty-five percent of the Company s Tier 1 capital, as defined, on a pro forma basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P165_S2	At December 31, 2010, all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	During 2002, Plumas Statutory Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities ( Trust Preferred Securities ), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P167_S3	The redemption price is par plus accrued and unpaid interest, except in the case of redemption under a special event which is defined in the debenture.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P167_S4	The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption to the extent of any early redemption of the Subordinated Debentures and upon maturity of the Subordinated Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	The Trust Preferred Securities were sold and issued in private transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	The Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the Trust Preferred Securities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	Since the second quarter of 2010, the Company has deferred regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	While the Company has accrued for this obligation, it is currently deferring the interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the agreements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P170_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $233,000.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P172_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P175_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P176_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, inventory, equipment, income-producing commercial properties, farm land and residential properties.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P177_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P177_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	At December 31, 2010, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 14% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 36% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 50% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P178_S3	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P180_S1	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectibility of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P180_S2	However, personal and business income represent the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P181_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P182_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P182_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company s assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ), to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the bank was restricted, without prior approval from the DFI, from paying cash dividends to the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 10 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	As describe below, dividends on common stock are also limited related to the Company s participation in the Capital Purchase Program.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P184_S1	Additionally, Plumas Bancorp was required by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB) to obtain the FRB s prior written consent before paying any dividends on its common stock or its Series A Preferred Stock, or making any payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Warrant has a 10-year term and is exercisable, with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company allocated the proceeds received on January 30, 2009 between the Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrant based on the estimated relative fair value of each.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	The fair value of the Warrant was estimated based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model and totaled $320,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P187_S2	The discount recorded on the Series A Preferred Stock was based on a discount rate of 12% and will be amortized by the level-yield method over 5 years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P187_S3	Discount accretion for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $79,000.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and will pay cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	With respect to dividends on the Company s common stock, Treasury s consent shall be required for any increase in common dividends per share until the third anniversary of the date of its investment unless prior to such third anniversary the Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole or the Treasury has transferred all of the Senior Preferred Series A Preferred Stock to third parties.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P189_S1	Furthermore, with respect to dividends on certain other series of preferred stock, restrictions from Treasury may apply.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company does not have any outstanding preferred stock other than the Series A Preferred Stock discussed above.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, Plumas Bancorp, as required by the FRB, suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	While Plumas Bancorp has accrued for this obligation, it is currently in arrears in the amount of $449,000 with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P192_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P192_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	When a net loss occurs, no difference in earnings per share is calculated because the conversion of potential common stock is anti-dilutive.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	Stock options not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 312,000 and 394,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	In 2001 and 1991, the Company established Stock Option Plans for which 873,185 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and 561,155 shares are available for future grants under incentive and nonstatutory agreements as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	The Plans require that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash or with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S3	The Plans do not provide for the settlement of awards in cash and new shares are issued upon option exercise.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S4	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S5	Upon grant, options vest ratably over a three to five year period.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P195_S6	A summary of the combined activity within the Plans follows:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there was $72,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2001 Plan.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P196_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P198_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P199_S1	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P199_S2	As a result of a regulatory examination in 2010, the Bank also became subject to Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and will become subject to a 10% Tier 1 leverage ratio and 13% total risk-based ratio under the Order described in Note 2.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P199_S3	At December 31, 2010, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.9% and the total risk-based capitol ratio was 14.0%.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P204_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	As part of its analysis, the Company considered the following positive evidence:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company s 2009 net loss was largely attributable to losses on its Construction and Land Development portfolio that represented approximately 80% of net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	This portfolio has significantly decreased during the last two years and the Company is not growing the portfolio.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	The Company s 2009 net loss was also attributable to large write-downs in Construction and Land Development real estate owned which represented the majority of its provision for losses on other real estate during 2009.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P207_S1	During 2010 other real estate write-downs decreased by $4.4 million from $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 to $356 thousand during 2010.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company has a long history of earnings profitability.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	The Company was profitable in 2010 and is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	The size of loan credits in the Company s pipeline of potential problem loans has significantly decreased.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	The Company does not have a history of net operating losses or tax credits expiring unused.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	As part of its analysis, the Company considered the following negative evidence:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company recorded a large net loss in 2009 and is in a cumulative loss position for the current and preceding two years.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	The significant items comprising these differences consisted of the following:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California jurisdictions.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	The Company conducts all of its business activities in the States of California and Nevada.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P218_S1	There are currently no pending U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2007, and by state and local taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2006.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	The unrecognized tax benefits and changes therein and the interest and penalties accrued by the Company as of December 31, 2010 were not significant.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	During the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties, including executive officers and directors.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	These transactions include borrowings with substantially the same terms, including rates and collateral, as loans to unrelated parties.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P221_S2	The following is a summary of the aggregate activity involving related party borrowers during 2010:
1168455_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Plumas Bank Profit Sharing Plan commenced April 1, 1988 and is available to employees meeting certain service requirements.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P224_S2	The estimated present value of these future benefits is accrued over the period from the effective dates of the agreements until the participants expected retirement dates based on a discount rate of 6.00%.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P224_S3	The expense recognized under these plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $342,000, $330,000 and $238,000, respectively.

1168455_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) is reported in addition to net income for all periods presented.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	Comprehensive income (loss) is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of other comprehensive income (loss) that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P226_S2	The unrealized gains and losses on the Company s available-for-sale investment securities are included in other comprehensive income (loss).
1168455_11_ITEM8_P226_S3	Total comprehensive income (loss) and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity.
1168455_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company held securities classified as available-for-sale which had unrealized gains as follows:

1168455_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

1168455_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Bank s Government-guaranteed lending center, headquartered in Auburn, California with additional personnel in Truckee, provides Small Business Administration and USDA Rural Development loans to qualified borrowers throughout Northern California and Northern Nevada.

1168455_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $13,000 at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	These include cashier s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers, on-line banking, remote deposit, mobile banking and other customary banking services.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	In order to provide non-deposit investment options, we have developed a strategic alliance with Financial Network Investment Corporation ( FNIC ).

1168455_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage while providing the customer with the opportunity to grow their savings through monthly monetary rewards for green behavior.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	The balance in this product at December 31, 2011 was $8.3 million.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn commercial lending office, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	We offer various loan products which promote home ownership and affordable housing, encourage job growth and support community economic development.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, and government-guaranteed community infrastructure loans.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S5	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P24_S6	Capital Purchase Program TARP Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and pays cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	The Warrant has a 10-year term and was immediately exercisable with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Prior to January 30, 2012, unless the Company has redeemed the Series A Preferred Stock, or the Treasury has transferred the Series A Preferred Stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required for the Company to: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of the Common Stock (other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than $0.04 per share or regular semi-annual cash dividends of not more than $0.08 per share); or (2) redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Common Stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	At the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB), Plumas Bancorp suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2011 the amount of the arrearage on the dividend payments of the Series A Preferred Stock is $1,046,000 representing seven quarterly payments.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the Trust I ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Debentures and trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly based on the floating rate described above on the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per security.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Company has entered into contractual agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee payment of: (1) accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the capital securities; (2) the redemption price with respect to any capital securities called for redemption by either Trust I or Trust II, and (3) payments due upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up, or liquidation of either Trust I or Trust II.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2011 the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $569,000 representing seven quarterly payments.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Effective in March, 2011, in connection with the Bank s regularly scheduled 2010 Joint FDIC and California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) examination, the Bank entered into a Consent Order ( Order ) with the FDIC and the DFI.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	The FDIC and DFI in the Order, required certain actions to be taken by the Bank including among others: continue to reduce certain classified asset balances, maintain strong capital ratios, improve lending policies and practices, and retain qualified management as stated in the terms of the Order.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	On February 15, 2012 the FDIC and DFI terminated this Order.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	While the Bank is no longer subject to an Order, the Bank has entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requests that the Bank continue to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	At December 31, 2011 this ratio was 68% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 9.8%.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	The lifting of the Order reflects the progress made by the Bank s management and board of directors in reducing classified asset balances, increasing capital ratios, improving lending policies and practices, and retaining qualified management as stated in the terms of the Order.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB Agreement ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp has agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement requires prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	In addition, the FRB Agreement requires Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	The Company submitted the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information related to the Order and FRB Agreement.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Banks assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	However, at December 31, 2011 approximately 81% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Currently, within the Bank s branch service area there are 55 banking branch offices of competing institutions, including 30 branches of 8 major banks.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	As of June 30, 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 68%, Quincy 59%, Portola 55%, Alturas 47%, Fall River Mills 36%, Susanville 33%, Kings Beach 32%, Truckee 15%, Tahoe City 5%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Redding is the location of our most recently opened branch, which became operational in June 2007.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, home computer, mobile, ATMs, full-service branches, and/or in-store branches.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P49_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company and its subsidiary employed 156 persons.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 142 persons.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including Plumas Bancorp s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	This Code of Ethics Policy is available on Plumas Bancorp s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S3	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S4	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P52_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, the Company is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	As a bank holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Federal and State Bank Regulation .
1168455_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	The Bank, as a state chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the California Department of Financial Institutions, the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	The California Department of Financial Institutions regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	As of the most recent CRA examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P59_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	W. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	We believe that the Bank is in compliance with these standards.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	Substantially all deposits with the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a bank s capital level and supervisory ratings.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	The base assessment rates under the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 ( Reform Act ), enacted in February 2006, ranged from $0.02 to $0.40 per $100 of deposits annually.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	The FDIC could increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule five basis points (annualized) higher or lower than the base rates in order to manage the DIF to prescribed statutory target levels.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	In December 2008, the FDIC adopted a rule that amended the system for risk-based assessments and changed assessment rates in attempt to restore targeted reserve ratios in the DIF.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S4	Effective January 1, 2009, the risk-based assessment rates were uniformly raised by seven basis points (annualized).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S5	On February 27, 2009, the FDIC further modified the risk-based assessment system, effective April 1, 2009, to effectively require larger risk institutions to pay a larger share of the assessment.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S6	Characteristics of larger risk institutions include a significant reliance on secured liabilities or brokered deposits, particularly when combined with rapid asset growth.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P63_S7	The rule also provided incentives for institutions to hold long-term unsecured debt and, for smaller institutions, high levels of Tier 1 capital.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The initial base assessment rates range from $0.12 to $0.45 per $100 of deposits annually.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	The Bank s assessment rate for 2010 fell at the middle of this range.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	After potential adjustments related to unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposit balances, the final total assessment rates range from $0.07 to $0.775 per $100 of deposits annually.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Initial base assessment rates for well managed, well capitalized institutions ranged from $0.12 to $0.16 per $100 of deposits annually.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC will forego the uniform three-basis point increase in initial assessment rates schedules for January 1, 2011 and maintain the current schedule of assessment rates.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system from a domestic deposit base to a scorecard based assessment system, effective April 1, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Effective as of April 1, 2011, the Bank was categorized as a small institution as the Bank has less than $10 billion in assets.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	The initial base assessment rates range from five to 35 basis points.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	After potential adjustments related to unsecured debt and brokered deposit balances, the final total assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	Initial base assessment rates for large institutions ranged from five to 35 basis points.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	The Bank s assessment rate for 2011 fell at the middle of this range.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P69_S4	Further increases in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending upon the amount of the increase.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	In 2006, the Reform Act increased the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement plan deposit accounts from $100,000 to $250,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	The basic insurance limit for other deposits, including individuals, joint account holders, businesses, government entities, and trusts, remained at $100,000.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P70_S2	The Reform Act also provided for the merger of the two deposit insurance funds administered by the FDIC, the Bank Insurance Fund ( BIF ) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund ( SAIF ), into the DIF.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	On October 3, 2008, the EESA temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	While the basic deposit insurance limit was to have returned to $100,000 after December 31, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified account.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	In November 2008, the FDIC approved the final ruling establishing the Transaction Account Guarantee Program ( TAGP ) as part of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLGP ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	Under this program, all non-interest bearing transaction accounts became fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	This unlimited coverage also extended to NOW (interest bearing deposit accounts) earning an interest rate no greater than 0.50% and all IOLTAs (lawyers trust accounts).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P72_S3	TAGP was extended with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for unlimited deposit insurance for noninterest bearing transactions accounts (excluding NOW, but including IOLTAs) expiring on December 31, 2012.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the Bank s liquidity position would likely be affected by deposit withdrawal activity.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P75_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P75_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Since December 31, 1992, the FRB and the FDIC have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 8%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 4%.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P77_S3	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P77_S4	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FRB and/or DFI to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	As discussed above, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital, as is the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and Bancorp as of December 31, 2011 follow: Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all of the above capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Company could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	Under the regulations, the Bank is considered Well Capitalized as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these regulatory capital guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	Banks with capital ratios below the required minimums are subject to certain administrative actions, including prompt corrective action, the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P83_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the ECOA ) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	The Truth in Lending Act (the TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P86_S2	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Fair Housing Act (the FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act (the RFPA ) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (the RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S3	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S4	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P89_S5	Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with CRA, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, HMDA, RFPA and RESPA generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	Federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time, and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	The following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ), signed into law in July, 2010, will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act creates of a new interagency council, the Financial System Oversight Council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the U.S. economy posed by systemically significant, large financial companies, including bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P91_S2	The Office of Thrift Supervision will be eliminated and its powers distributed among the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P91_S3	The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S3	The legislation also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S4	Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P93_S5	The Dodd-Frank Act also repeals the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, and removes many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state-chartered banks.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	The FDIC and the OCC now have authority to approve applications by insured state nonmember banks and national banks, respectively, to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank s home state if the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	The enactment of this section may significantly increase interstate banking by community banks in western states, where barriers to entry were previously high.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will not take effect for at least a year, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	Although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those provisions relating to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will increase the Bank s operating and compliance costs as it is likely that the Bank s existing regulatory agencies will adopt the same or similar consumer protections as the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will adopt.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	On June 21, 2010, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on incentive compensation.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	The final guidance is largely unchanged from the FRB s preliminary guidance published in 2009, with the exception of a few adjustments/clarifications in response to feedback the FRB received during the open comment period.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	The guidance became effective on June 25, 2010 (the date published in the Federal Register, and applies to all banks.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S3	Except for the largest banking organizations, enforcement of this guidance will be handled through the supervisors regular risk-focused examination process.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S4	The guidance is principles-based, rather than prescriptive, and also identifies expectations of large banking organizations that go beyond what will be expected of community banks, and emphasizes that the application of the guidance should be scaled appropriately for the complexity of the organization and the extent to which incentive arrangements are utilized.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S5	The employees covered by the final guidance are senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of the organization s firm-wide activities or material business lines; individual employees, including non-executive employees, whose activities may expose the organization to material amounts of risk; and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who, in the aggregate, may expose the organization to material amounts of risk, even if no individual employee is likely to expose the organization to material risk.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P97_S6	The guidance provides for three principles for safe and sound incentive compensation arrangements:
1168455_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	Strong Corporate Governance: Banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the EFTA ) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer ( EFT ) systems.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	The EFTA is implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse ( ACH ) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S3	Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S4	The new rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S5	The new rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S6	For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S7	The mandatory compliance date for the Regulation E amendments is July 1, 2010 provided that the Bank may continue to assess overdraft service fees or charges on existing customer accounts prior to August 15, 2010, without obtaining the consumer s affirmative consent.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P99_S8	The Bank s compliance with the new Regulation E amendments may have an impact on the Bank s revenue from overdraft service fees and non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) charges.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	In May 2009 the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	The new law permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	In implementing the law, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to (1) provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) make mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S3	The new law also authorizes the Secretary of HUD to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S4	The new law also amends the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S5	Also in May 2009, the Credit Card Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S6	The new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions, such as when a promotional rate ends, there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S7	Interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S8	Significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S9	The new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers (such as utility companies and other creditors) for existing credit card balances, though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S10	The new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S11	Opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S12	They have at least five years to pay the balance.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P100_S13	Credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under 21, unless they have adult co-signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	The new law requires card issuers to give card account holders a reasonable amount of time to make payments on monthly bills.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	That means payments would be due at least 21 days after they are mailed or delivered.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P101_S2	Credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	When consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	Consumers must opt in to over-limit fees.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P102_S2	Those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P102_S3	Fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P102_S4	Finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	Fees on credit cards cannot exceed 25 percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling US economy.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	ARRA authorizes spending of $787 billion, including about $288 billion for tax relief, $144 billion for state and local relief aid, and $111 billion for infrastructure and science.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P104_S2	In addition, ARRA includes additional executive compensation restrictions for recipients of funds from the US Treasury under the Troubled Assets Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( EESA ).
1168455_12_ITEM1_P104_S3	EESA was amended by ARRA to provide additional incentive compensation restrictions for financial institutions receiving TARP funds and also require additional corporate governance provisions with respect to limiting golden parachutes, lavish expenditures and requiring officer certifications of compliance and clawbacks for improperly earned incentive compensation at such institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM1_P104_S4	In addition, EESA as amended by ARRA provides that for any TARP recipient, its annual meeting materials shall include a nonbinding shareholder approval proposal of executive compensation for shareholders to vote.

1168455_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	The following table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	General We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Overview The Company recorded net income of $941 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011, a slight decrease from net income of $971 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2010 but up $10.1 million over 2009 s net loss of $9.1 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Excluding a $1.4 million gain ($0.8 million net of tax) in 2010 on sale of the Bank s merchant card portfolio, net income would have increased by $0.8 million over 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Net interest income declined by $713 thousand from $17.5 million during 2010 to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	This decrease in net interest income was mostly related to a $21 million decline in average loan balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011 non-interest income decreased by $1.3 million to $7.2 million, from $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S5	This decrease was related to a $1.4 million gain on the sale of our merchant processing portfolio in 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S6	Additionally, gain on sale of investment securities declined by $494 thousand from $1.2 million in 2010 to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S7	Partially offsetting these declines in non-interest income was an $884 thousand increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans from $1.1 million in 2010 to $1.9 million in 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S8	Non-interest expense increased by $105 thousand from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $19.2 million during the current twelve month period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S9	While we have achieved savings in many categories of non-interest expense these were offset in the current year by an increase of $649 thousand in loss on sale of OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S10	The most significant expense reduction was a $2.0 million decrease in our provision for loan losses from $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $3.5 million during 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S11	The $3.5 million provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily relates to net charge-offs during the twelve month period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S12	We have experienced a $3.8 million decrease in net charge-offs during the comparison years.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S13	Net charge-offs declined from $7.7 million during 2010 to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S14	Net charge-offs as percentage of average loans decreased significantly from 2.39% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to 1.29% during the current year.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S15	The provision for income taxes declined from $389 thousand in 2010 to $295 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P14_S16	Net income allocable to common shareholders decreased slightly from $287 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $257 thousand during 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income allocable to common shareholders is calculated by subtracting dividends and discount amortized on preferred stock from net income.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2011 decreased $29.1 million, or 6% to $455 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Decreases include $5.1 million in investment securities, $19.7 million in net loans, $1.6 million in cash and due from banks and $2.7 million in all other assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Net loans decreased by 6% from $307 million at December 31, 2010 to $287 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	This decline in net loans was mostly related to normal pay downs and prepayments, loan charge-offs, real estate acquired through foreclosure and our continued efforts to reduce the level of construction and land development loan balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	At December 31, 2011 investment securities totaled $57.9 million compared to $63.0 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Investment securities are composed of debt securities issued by agencies sponsored by the U.S. Government.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Total deposits were $391 million as of December 31, 2011, a decrease of $33.7 million, or 8%, from the December 31, 2010 balance of $425 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	The decline in deposits was primarily related to maturities from a higher rate promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Core deposit growth was strong with increases in non-interest bearing deposits of $14.1 million and savings deposits of $10.8 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	Non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits increased from 26.3% at December 31, 2010 to 32.2% at December 31, 2011.

1168455_12_ITEM7_P18_S6	This increase was mostly related to earnings during the period, the reversal of $524 thousand in accrued preferred stock dividends and an increase of $210 thousand in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss from a loss of $52 thousand at December 31, 2010 to accumulated other comprehensive income of $158 thousand at December 31, 2011.

1168455_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	(1) Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	(4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	(5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decline of $0.7 million, or 4.1%, from $17.5 million for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	The overall change in net interest income was primarily a result of a decrease of $1.5 million in loan interest income and a decline of $628 thousand in interest income on investment securities.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	The decline in interest on loans was mostly related to a decline in average loans outstanding.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Interest on investments securities declined related to a decrease in both yield and average balance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	Partially offsetting these decreases in interest income was a decline in rates paid on the Company s deposits and a decline in the average balance of time deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and long-term borrowings.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	Interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 9.7%, to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S8	The average loan balances were $302.8 million for 2011, down $21.1 million from the $323.9 million for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S9	This decline in loans was mostly related to normal pay downs and prepayments, loan charge-offs, real estate acquired through foreclosure and our on-going efforts to reduce the level of construction and land development loan balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S10	The average yields on loans were 5.75% for 2011 down from the 5.82% for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S11	Interest on investment securities decreased by $628 thousand resulting from a decrease in yield of 63 basis points and a decline in average investment securities of $9.9 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P28_S12	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $124 thousand in 2011 and $48 thousand in 2010, relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $1.2 million, or 46%, to $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, down from $2.7 million in 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	This decrease primarily relates to decreases in the average balance and rate paid on time deposits and a decline in the rate paid on demand deposit (NOW) and money market accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest on time deposits declined by $946 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Average time deposits declined by $27.8 million from $124.8 million during 2010 to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decrease in time deposits is mostly related to a promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	These promotional time deposits have now fully matured.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	The average rate paid on these promotional deposits during 2011 was 2%.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.61% during 2010 to 1.09% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of the higher rate promotional deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S7	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $195 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S8	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 18 basis points from 0.38% during 2010 to 0.20% during 2011, as we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S9	Although we lost deposits by lowering this rate; we continue to focus on the profitability of the public sweep accounts rather than growing public sweep balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S10	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $106 thousand related primarily to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 23 basis points from 0.52% during 2010 to 0.29% during 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S11	This was primarily related to a significant drop in the rates paid on our money market sweep product.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S12	We no longer offer the money market sweep account having replaced it with a product that utilizes repurchase agreements during the third quarter of 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S13	Interest on FHLB long term borrowings decreased by $130 thousand as there were no outstanding long term borrowings during 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S14	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $14 thousand from 2010, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P30_S15	Interest on other borrowings in 2011 primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.

1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2011 decreased 16 basis points to 4.08%, from 4.24% for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decline of $1.6 million, or 8.6%, from $19.2 million for 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	The overall change in net interest income was primarily a result of a decrease of $1.8 million in loan interest income, due to a decline in average loans outstanding.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	Additionally, interest on investments securities declined by $391 thousand, related to a decrease in yield.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	Partially offsetting these decreases in interest income was a decline in rates paid on the Company s deposits and borrowings.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S6	Interest income decreased $2.2 million, or 9.4%, to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S7	Interest and fees on loans decreased by $1.8 million from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $18.9 million for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S8	The average loan balances were $323.9 million for 2010, down $30.6 million from the $354.5 million for 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S9	The decline in loan balances is consistent with the decrease in economic activity in the Company s service area and the Company s successful effort to reduce its exposure to real estate construction and land development loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S10	The average yields on loans were 5.82% for 2010 as compared to the 5.83% for 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S11	Interest on investment securities decreased by $391 thousand, as a decrease in yield of 83 basis points was partially offset by an increase in average investment securities of $5.3 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P31_S12	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Deposit rates in the Bank s service area continued to decline in 2010 resulting in a decline in interest expense on deposits of $473 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $3.2 million for 2009 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	All deposit products experienced rate declines in 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Interest expense on NOW accounts decreased by $289 thousand related to a decrease in the average rate paid on these accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 30 basis points from 0.68% during 2009 to 0.38% during 2010 as we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	Although we lost some deposits by lowering this rate; we currently are more focused on the profitability of the public sweep accounts rather than the amount of deposits we can generate from this source.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $125 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 31 basis points from 0.83% during the year ended December 31, 2009 to 0.52% during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	This was primarily related to a significantly drop in the rates paid on our money market sweep product.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Interest on time deposits declined by $55 thousand as an increase in average balance was offset by a decline in rate paid.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, the Company s average time deposits increased by $19.5 million from $105.3 million for 2009 to $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S4	The increase in time deposits is related to a promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S5	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.96% during 2009 to 1.61% during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S6	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates in the Company s service area.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S7	Interest on borrowings increased by $28 thousand related to an increase in the rate paid on borrowings as we chose to extend the term of our borrowings; however, this was partially offset by a $59 thousand decline in interest paid on junior subordinated debentures.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S8	Interest expense on FHLB long-term borrowings increased by $103 thousand to $130 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S9	We chose to prepay these borrowings during July 2010 as we had significant excess liquidity and no longer projected a need for these long-term borrowings.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P33_S10	We incurred a $226 thousand prepayment penalty on these advances which we anticipate will be more than offset by future savings in interest expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Interest on short-term borrowings decreased by $75 thousand to $5 thousand related to a decline in average balance of $23.3 million from $24.3 million during 2009 to $986 thousand during 2010.

1168455_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Provision for Loan Losses During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.5 million down $2.0 million from the $5.5 million provision recorded during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011 non-interest income decreased by $1.3 million to $7.2 million, from $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	This decrease was related to the sale of our merchant processing portfolio in 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	During June 2010 we entered into an alliance with a world-wide merchant processing leader.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	In conjunction with this alliance we sold our merchant processing business, recording a one-time gain of $1.4 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Related to this sale we experienced a decrease in merchant processing income of $126 thousand during the comparison periods.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $165 thousand primarily related to a decline in overdraft fees as new regulations placed additional restrictions on the Bank in charging overdraft fees on ATM and Point of Sale transactions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	Gain on sale of investments declined by $494 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011 we sold twenty-seven investment securities classified as available-for-sale for $29.4 million recognizing a $0.7 million gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	During the 2010 period we sold sixty-five investment securities classified as available-for sale for $40.9 million and recorded a $1.2 million gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S7	We chose to sell some of the securities in our investment portfolio in order to lock in gains; this had the additional benefit of partially offsetting some nonrecurring expense items such as losses on sale of OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P41_S8	Partially offsetting these declines in income was a $884 thousand increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Gains on sale in 2011 were particularly strong related to two factors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	First, during the first quarter of 2011 the SBA eliminated the recourse provision related to loan sales allowing us to record both gains on sales from loans sold during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, many loans sold in 2011 were 90% guaranteed related to a temporary increase in guarantee percentage enacted on February 17, 2009 as part of the Recovery Act.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Currently loans made through the SBA 7(a) program carry a 75% to 85% guarantee.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The production and sale of government guaranteed loans has become an important component of the Company s core business.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	We expect government guaranteed lending activity to remain strong in 2012; however, we anticipate a reduction in gains on sale during 2012.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Loan servicing fees increased by $24 thousand to $219 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Loan servicing fees are primarily related to fees earned for servicing the sold portion of SBA loans and the increase in this category is consistent with the increase in sold SBA loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 non-interest income increased by $2.8 million to $8.6 million, from $5.8 million during 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	This increase was primarily related to three items, the largest of which was a $1.4 million gain on the sale of our merchant processing portfolio.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Additionally we sold securities having a book value of $39.7 million, recording a gain on sale of $1.2 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	We chose to sell substantially our entire municipal securities portfolio as part of our overall asset/liability management strategy and related to the favorable market price for these securities.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	In addition, we sold $28.9 million in U.S. government agency securities to lock in significant gains that were available on these securities.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	Finally, we recorded a gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million representing the sale of $13.6 million in loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	Additional SBA government guaranteed loans totaling $4.3 million were sold during the fourth quarter; however, the gain on sale generated was not recorded until the 90-day premium recourse period on SBA loan sales had expired.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P44_S7	During the first quarter of 2011, the Company recognized a gain on sale of approximately $338 thousand related to loans sold during the fourth quarter of 2010; however, this gain was partially offset by commission expense of approximately $106 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Loan servicing fees increased by $56 thousand to $195 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Loan servicing fees are primarily related to fees earned for servicing the sold portion of SBA loans and the increase in this category is consistent with the increase in sold SBA loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $154 thousand primarily related to a decline in overdraft fees as new regulations placed additional restrictions on the Bank in charging overdraft fees on ATM and Point of Sale transactions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Merchant processing fees declined by $141 thousand related to the sale of our merchant processing portfolio in June, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	The following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	While we have achieved savings in many categories of non-interest expense these were offset in the current year by an increase of $649 thousand in loss on sale of OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Non-interest expense increased by $105 thousand from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $19.2 million during the current twelve month period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Loss on sale of OREO totaled $606 thousand primarily related to the sale of one property.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	During June, 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented $4.3 million, or 48% of the total balance in OREO at January 1, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on sale; however, management believes the loss was prudent given the significant affect this transaction had in decreasing nonperforming assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Outside service fees increased by $58 thousand which mostly relates to our on-line banking and bill payment platform.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	FDIC insurance costs increased related to an increase in the rate the FDIC charges Plumas Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	Professional fees increased by $143 thousand the largest portion of which was related to an increase in consulting cost of $97 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	During the second half of 2011 we contracted with an outside party to provide assistance in the management of our nonperforming assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Total costs incurred related to this consultant were $42 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition we incurred $21 thousand in costs related to an outside management study required by the Consent Order.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	The largest reduction in expense was a decrease of $537 thousand in salaries and employee benefits.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	Salary expense, excluding commissions, declined by $667 thousand mostly related to a reduction in staffing, during the second quarter of 2010, which affected most functional areas with the exception of government guaranteed lending and problem assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S5	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 142 persons at December 31, 2011 down from 146 at December 31, 2010 and 163 at December 31, 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S6	Commission expense, which relates to government guaranteed lending personnel and is included in salary expense, increased by $318 thousand resulting from the increase in government guaranteed loan gains.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S7	The provision for OREO losses increased by $223 thousand related to one land development property that, based on a recent appraisal, declined in value by $417 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P48_S8	This property is currently valued at approximately $1 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	OREO carrying costs declined by $151 thousand from $573 thousand during 2010 to $422 thousand during 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	These savings were primarily related to property taxes on OREO properties and refunds on prior year tax payments related to some of our OREO properties being reassessed.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Insurance expense declined by $83 thousand primarily related to the forfeiture of retirement split dollar life insurance benefits by one of our executive officers who chose to terminate his employment during 2011 prior to age sixty-five.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	Other non-interest expense declined by $228 thousand related to a $226 thousand prepayment penalty incurred upon the prepayment of our long-term Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings during July, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	During the second quarter of 2010 we performed an extensive analysis of our personnel requirements throughout the organization and based on this analysis we were able to reduce our head count by approximately 10% which resulted in significant savings in salary and benefits during the second half of 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2010, total non-interest expense decreased by $7.1 million, or 27%, to $19.2 million, down from $26.3 million for the comparable period in 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S6	This decrease in non-interest expense was primarily the result of savings in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional fees, provision for OREO losses and a reduction in losses on the sale of OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S7	These items and other reductions were partially offset by increases in outside service fees, OREO carrying expenses and insurance expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S8	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $1.3 million primarily related to four items.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S9	Salary expense, excluding commissions, declined by $796 thousand related to a reduction in staffing in all areas with the exception of government guaranteed lending and problem assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S10	While the Company reduced personnel in most functional areas, we increased staffing in our problem asset department to effectively manage our increased level of nonperforming assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S11	Additionally, staffing in our government guaranteed lending department was increased to support opportunities for loan growth in this area.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S12	Commission expense, which relates to government guaranteed lending personnel and is included in salary expense, increased by $152 thousand resulting from the increase in government guaranteed loan sales.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P49_S13	Stock compensation expense decreased by $199 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the first quarter of 2010 we recorded an adjustment to the estimated forfeiture rate associated with option expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Finally, we eliminated discretionary bonuses in 2010 resulting in a decrease in bonus expense of $269 thousand and during the second quarter of 2010 we discontinued the Company matching contributions to our 401k plan saving $172 thousand during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The decline in occupancy and equipment expense primarily relates to the savings realized from the purchase of our Redding branch.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	On March 31, 2010 we purchased the building housing our Redding branch at a cost of $1.0 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with accounting principals we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in occupancy costs.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	In addition to the one-time savings from the reversal of accrued rent we benefit from reduced operating costs on this building as the owner rather than a renter.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	Occupancy costs also benefited from a milder winter resulting in reduced utility and snow removal costs.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S6	Equipment costs benefited from a $153 thousand reduction in depreciation expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S7	Professional fees were abnormally high during 2009 related to consulting costs associated with our computer network and telephone system.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S8	The decrease in profession fees includes a $157 thousand reduction in consulting costs.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S9	Losses on the sale of OREO totaled $158 thousand during 2009; however, during 2010 we recorded $43 thousand net gains on sale of OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S10	During 2009 we experienced a significant decline in the value of many of our OREO properties requiring a $4.8 million loss provision; however, this decline in value slowed significantly in 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S11	During 2010 our provision for OREO losses declined by $4.4 million to $356 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S12	Other reductions in expense include savings in FDIC insurance, telephone, loan collection costs, business development, advertising, director expense, courier expense, director expenses, supplies costs and other.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S13	In total these costs were down $789 thousand for 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S14	Outside service fees increased by $222 thousand related to the outsourcing of daily management of our computer network operations and the installation of a new internet banking platform.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S15	OREO carrying expenses increased by $203 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P52_S16	Insurance expense was abnormally low in 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	During the first quarter of 2009 our Chief Information and Technology officer retired from the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Because his retirement took place prior to the age of sixty-five he forfeited his benefits under his company provided split dollar life insurance plan.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	To reflect this forfeiture we recorded a one-time reduction in insurance expense totaling $83 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $295 thousand, or 23.9% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	During 2010 the Company recorded an income tax provision of $389 thousand, or 28.6% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The percentages for 2011 and 2010 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance, municipal loan interest, and in the state of California enterprise zone interest decrease taxable income.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	As part of its analysis, the Company considered the following positive evidence:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company s 2009 net loss was also attributable to significant write-downs on foreclosed construction and land development real estate properties which represented the majority of its provision for losses on other real estate during 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	During 2010 other real estate write-downs decreased by $4.4 million from $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 to $356 thousand during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Write-downs on construction and land development real estate owned during 2011 totaled $440 thousand.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has a long history of earnings and profitability.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company was profitable in 2011 and 2010 and is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The size of loans in the Company s pipeline of potential problem loans has significantly decreased.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company does not have a history of net operating losses carry forwards or tax credits expiring unused.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	As part of its analysis, the Company also considered the following negative evidence:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company recorded a large net loss in 2009 and is in a cumulative loss position for the current and preceding two years.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	These commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	The Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, and agricultural loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S5	These categories accounted for approximately 40.6%, 13.3% and 13.2%, respectively of the Company s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, and approximately 37.9%, 13.8% and 12.2%, respectively of the Company s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S6	Construction and land development loans continue to decline and represented 5.8% and 9.9% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S7	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P64_S8	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio reflects management s continued efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 81% and 80% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P65_S5	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, approximately 73% and 66%, respectively, of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $39 million at December 31, 2011 and $38 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P67_S4	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	(2) Includes agriculture real estate The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates: Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S4	The Board s Loan Committee reviews the asset quality of new loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P69_S5	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	It consists of members of executive management and credit administration management, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The federal financial regulatory agencies in December 2006 issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	When determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company follows these guidelines.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The policy statement revises and replaces a 1993 policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	The policy statement was also revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and post-1993 supervisory guidance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	The policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing, maintaining and documenting a comprehensive, systematic, and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature, scope, and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP, the institution s stated policies and procedures, management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	The policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio, and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P76_S5	The policy statement states that prudent, conservative, but not excessive, loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	No. 102, which represents the SEC staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the Commission s interpretations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements, which include but are not limited to:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	specific allocation determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 Receivables, based on probable losses on specific loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in ASC Topic 450 Contingencies, based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified, impaired, and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original contractual terms of the loan agreement are in question.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	For purposes of this analysis, loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are watch , substandard , doubtful , and loss .
1168455_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Watch loans are currently performing but are potentially weak, as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends, which if not corrected, could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses which, if not corrected, could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	A loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Classified loans, as defined by the Company, include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Loans classified as loss are immediately charged off.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Loans are consistently monitored against risk rating criteria.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	As loans are identified that may warrant a classification change, they are discussed with the Company s credit administration officers and appropriate risk grades are assigned.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P82_S4	There are several times in the life of a loan that this occurs:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	If weaknesses (or improvements) are noted, a change in risk rating, if warranted by credit administration, will be made.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Loans classified Watch or below in an amount of $100,000 or more will be individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the Bank s policy for determining and measuring impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Effective for the third quarter of 2010, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	This modification incorporated historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter to identified pools of loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	This modification did not have a material affect on the Company s allowance for loans losses or provision for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	No modifications to the allowance for loan losses methodology were made in 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.5 million down $2.0 million from the $5.5 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Net charge-offs totaled $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $7.7 million during 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 2.39% during 2010 to 1.29% during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses: The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2011 and $7.3 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S5	Specific reserves related to impaired loans increased from $1.9 million at December 31, 2010 to $2.1 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S6	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it reverses the specific reserve and takes a partial charge-off in its place.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S7	General reserves decreased by $579 thousand to $4.8 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S8	The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased slightly from 2.33% at December 31, 2010 to 2.35% at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P87_S9	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans decreased from 1.90% at December 31, 2010 to 1.80% at December 31, 2011 primarily related to a decrease in charge-offs during the eight quarters ending December 31, 2011 as compared to the eight quarters ended December 31, 2010 which resulted in a lower loss rate applied to unimpaired loans.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	Where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P89_S4	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled $8.4 million, $2.0 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	There were no troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2008, or 2007.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 6 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011 were $16.8 million, a decrease of $8.5 million from the $25.3 million balance at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The decline of $8.5 million includes $5.7 million in loans transferred to OREO, a $4.4 million loan that was returned to performing status and charge-offs and principal repayments on nonperforming loans partially offset by $9.1 million in additional loans placed on nonperforming status during the period.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $1.3 million at December 31, 2011 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days increased from $2.9 million at December 31, 2010 to $5.1 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $9.4 million from $38.6 million at December 31, 2010 to $29.2 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased as well from $14.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $10.7 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S3	At December 31, 2011, $13.9 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S5	At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $24.4 million and $28.8 million, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S6	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $2.1 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P96_S7	Additionally, $940 thousand has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2011 and $2.8 million at December 31 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2011 is appropriate.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	Repossessed assets and OREO are carried at fair market value, less selling costs.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	OREO holdings represented forty-four properties totaling $8.6 million at December 31, 2011 and thirty-one properties totaling $8.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	During June, 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented $4.3 million, or 48% of the total balance in OREO at January 1, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S5	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on sale; however, management believes the loss was prudent given the significant affect this transaction had in decreasing nonperforming assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S6	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 5.60% at December 31, 2011 and 7.07% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S7	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P98_S8	Total investment securities decreased by $5.1 million from $63.0 million at December 31, 2010 to $57.9 million as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	While investment securities decreased from December 31, 2010 levels, we anticipate adding to investment securities during the next three months.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 was invested entirely in U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, at December 31, 2010 the investment portfolio consisted of 2% U.S. Treasuries and 98% U.S. Government-sponsored agencies.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2011 or 2010; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) totaling $47.8 million at December 31, 2011 and $52.3 million at December 31, 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	These balances currently earn 25 basis points.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated: At December 31, 2009 the Company transferred all of its municipal securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale as it was determined that management no longer had the intent to hold these investments to maturity.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	Total deposits were $391.1 million as of December 31, 2011, a decrease of $33.8 million, or 8%, from the December 31, 2010 balance of $424.9 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	The decline in deposits was mostly related to maturities from a higher rate promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	Core deposit growth was strong with increases in non-interest bearing deposits of $14.1 million and an increase in savings accounts of $10.8 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S5	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S6	The deposit mix changed slightly from December 31, 2010 as time deposits deceased and we had an increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S7	Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 and 26% of total deposits at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S8	Interest bearing transaction accounts were 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 and 24% of total deposits at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S9	Money market and savings deposits totaled 26% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 and 22% at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S10	Time deposits were 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 and 28% of total deposits at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S11	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S12	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P101_S13	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	Included in time deposits at December 31, 2010 were $2.0 million in CDARS reciprocal time deposits which, under regulatory guidelines, are classified as brokered deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2011:
1168455_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company s local business and individual customer base.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	The potential impact on the Company s liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company s asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $86,388,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $178,987,000.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	At December 31, 2011, the Company held $2,043,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $43,466,000.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P104_S5	To borrow the $86,388,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,017,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Recently Plumas Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	The balance in this product at December 31, 2011 was $8.3 million.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Capital Resources Shareholders equity as of December 31, 2011 totaled $39.6 million up from $38.0 million as of December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	On January 30, 2009, under the Capital Purchase Program, the Company sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Shares ) and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $7.54 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	Ten million of the twelve million in proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock was injected into Plumas Bank providing addition capital for the bank to support growth in loans and investment securities and strengthen its capital ratios.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	The remainder provided funds for holding company activities and general corporate purposes.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P107_S4	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors (the Board).
1168455_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	No common cash dividends were paid in 2009, 2010 or 2011 and none are anticipated to be paid in 2012.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities and suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P110_S2	Therefore, Plumas Bancorp is currently in arrears with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock and interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the related documentation.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P110_S3	As of December 31, 2011 the amount of the arrearage on the dividend payments of the Series A Preferred Stock is $1,046 thousand representing seven quarterly payments and the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $569 thousand also representing seven quarterly payments.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, with risk-based capital ratios calculated separately for the Company and the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	There are two categories of capital under the guidelines: Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders equity, and qualifying trust-preferred securities (including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other deductions, notably the unrealized net gains or losses (after tax adjustments) on available-for-sale investment securities carried at fair market value; Tier 2 capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P112_S3	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	As noted previously, the Company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate $10 million in trust-preferred securities.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	These trust-preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed 25% of total Tier 1 capital, but are classified as long-term debt in accordance with GAAP.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust-preferred securities (and/or related subordinated debentures) in the Tier I capital of bank holding companies.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands except percentage amounts).
1168455_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank currently meet their entire capital adequacy requirements including a minimum 9% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio required under the Bank s informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized leverage, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of 5%, 6% and 10%, respectively, at all times.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $79.2 million in unfunded loan commitments and $50 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	This compares to $71.6 million in unfunded loan commitments and $164 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S4	Of the $79.2 million in unfunded loan commitments, $35.1 million and $44.1 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2011, $36.1 million were secured by real estate, of which $8.8 million was secured by commercial real estate and $27.3 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P118_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The Company leases one depository branch, one lending office and one loan administration office and two non branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases, including premises, totaled $150,000 and $20,000, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2012 and the last such lease expiring during 2015.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	The reduced level of rental expense during 2010 resulted from the purchase of our Redding branch building on March 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S4	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S5	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with applicable accounting standards we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P119_S6	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in rental expense.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P120_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $86,388,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $178,987,000.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	At December 31, 2011, the Company held $2,043,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $43,466,000.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P17_S5	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P17_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P17_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	THE BUSINESS OF PLUMAS BANCORP During 2002, Plumas Bancorp (the Company ) was incorporated as a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring Plumas Bank (the Bank ) in a one bank holding company reorganization.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation expansion and diversification.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I ( Trust I ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust II ( Trust II ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 28, 2005.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Bank operates eleven branches in California, including branches in Alturas, Chester, Fall River Mills, Greenville, Kings Beach, Portola, Quincy, Redding, Susanville, Tahoe City, and Truckee.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Bank s administrative headquarters is in Quincy, California.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	In addition, the Bank operates a loan administrative office in Reno, Nevada and a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Bank s primary source of revenue is generated from providing loans to customers who are predominately small and middle market businesses and individuals residing in the surrounding areas.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), which, in part, permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Amendments related to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts beginning December 31, 2010 for a two year period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS On February 15, 2012, the Bank received notice from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) that the Consent Order with the FDIC and the DFI which was effective on March 16, 2011 had been terminated.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	While the Bank is no longer subject to an Order, the Bank has entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requests that the Bank continue to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	At December 31, 2011 this ratio was 68%.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB Agreement ).
1168455_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp has agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement requires prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	In addition, the FRB Agreement requires Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	The Company submitted the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	Plumas Statutory Trust I and Trust II are not consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	The Company s investment in Trust I of $283,000 and Trust II of $154,000 are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued and guaranteed by the Company and held by Trust I and Trust II are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances to conform to the classifications used in 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Segment Information Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Use of Estimates To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2011 all cash held with other federally insured institutions was fully insured by the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P37_S3	Net cash flows are reported for customer loans and deposit transactions and repurchase agreements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P37_S4	Investment Securities Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	During 2009, management determined they no longer had the positive intent to hold their held-to-maturity securities and transferred their held-to-maturity securities to available- for-sale (see note 5).
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S3	This transfer increased the Company s flexibility in managing its investment portfolio allowing the investments to be sold in implementing its asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S4	All transfers between categories are accounted for at fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P39_S5	There were no transfers between categories during 2011 or 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P41_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, FHLB stock totaled $2,043,000 and $2,188,000, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P42_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Loans Held for Sale, Loan Sales and Servicing Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	At December 31, 2010, we recorded the proceeds from the sale of the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that were subject to a premium refund obligation, which totaled $4,284,000, were recorded as a secured borrowing and such secured borrowings were included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	Once the premium refund obligation elapsed the transaction was recorded as a sale with the guaranteed portions of loans and the secured borrowing removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain on sale recorded.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Included in commercial loans at December 31, 2010 is $4,284,000 in guaranteed portions of SBA loans sold subject to a 90-day premium refund obligation.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	In February 2011, the SBA eliminated the refund obligation period and the Company is no longer required to defer gain recognition.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company had $3,091,000 and $5,208,000, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair vale and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loans Held for Sale, Loan Sales and Servicing (continued) Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $47,708,000 and $33,686,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company also services loans previously sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) totaling $1,932,000 and $2,185,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S4	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S5	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S6	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S7	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of operations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P47_S8	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan, the servicing asset, the interest-only (IO) strip, and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S3	The servicing asset is recognized and amortized over the estimated life of the related loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S4	Assets (accounted for as IO strips) are recorded at the fair value of the difference between note rates and rates paid to purchasers (the interest spread) and contractual servicing fees, if applicable.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S5	IO strips are carried at fair value with gains or losses recorded as a component of shareholders equity, similar to available-for-sale investment securities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P48_S6	Significant future prepayments of these loans will result in the recognition of additional amortization of related servicing assets and an adjustment to the carrying value of related IO strips.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Loans Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectibility of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectibility of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S5	The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P53_S6	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses over the past eight quarters by portfolio segment, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Effective for the third quarter of 2010, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	This modification incorporated historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter to identified pools of loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	This modification did not have a material affect on the Company s allowance for loans losses or provision for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	No modifications to the allowance for loan losses methodology were made in 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial and industrial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, installment loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of credit card receivables.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows: Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P69_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P69_S3	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P69_S4	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described below.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Allowance for Loan Losses (continued) Commercial Commercial loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than real estate portfolio segments because these loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S4	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S5	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S6	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P73_S7	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	Installment An installment loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of small loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	Most installment loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business loans granted for the purchase of heavy equipment or industrial vehicles may also be included.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P75_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of automobile and credit card loans and are similar in nature to installment loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DFI, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P77_S5	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $141,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	Other Real Estate Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $8,623,000 ($11,668,000 less a valuation allowance of $3,045,000) at December 31, 2011 and $8,867,000 ($13,056,000 less a valuation allowance of $4,188,000) at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S3	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $4,937,000, $3,462,000 and $1,992,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company recorded a loss on sale of other real estate owned of $606,000.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S5	This compares to a gain on sale of $43,000 during 2010 and a loss on sale of $158,000 during 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S6	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S7	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S8	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S9	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are recorded in other income or expenses as incurred.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P78_S10	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over ten years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	There were no such events or circumstances in 2011 or 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	Income Taxes The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P87_S4	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S5	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P89_S6	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders (net income or (loss) less preferred dividends) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	Dividend Restrictions Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	In addition, the Bank and the Bancorp cannot currently pay dividends without the prior approval of their primary regulators.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plan, net of related tax (expense)/benefit, recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $(38,000), $53,000 and $237,000 or $(0.01), $0.01 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P95_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	In April 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance for assisting a creditor in determining whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The amendments clarify the guidance for a creditor s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	With regard to determining whether a concession has been granted, the ASU clarifies that creditors are precluded from using the effective interest method to determine whether a concession has been granted.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	In the absence of using the effective interest method, a creditor must now focus on other considerations such as the value of the underlying collateral, evaluation of other collateral or guarantees, the debtor s ability to access other funds at market rates, interest rate increases and whether the restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2011, and should be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P98_S3	For purposes of measuring impairment on newly identified troubled debt restructurings, the amendments should be applied prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	The effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	In May, 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. and International accounting principles.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	Overall, the guidance is consistent with existing U.S. accounting principles; however, there are some amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	The amendments in this guidance are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S4	In June 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S5	The amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S6	The amendments in this guidance are effective as of the beginning of a fiscal reporting year, and interim periods within that year, that begins after December 15, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P100_S7	The adoption of this amendment will change the presentation of the components of comprehensive income for the Company, as this presentation will no longer be included as part of the consolidated statement of shareholders equity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows: These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: Cash and cash equivalents: For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is estimated to be fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Investment securities: For investment securities, fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P102_S2	If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities and indications of value provided by brokers.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	Loans: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	Fair values of loans held for sale, if any, are estimated using quoted market prices for similar loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	The fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered at each reporting date for loans with similar terms to borrowers of comparable creditworthiness.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P103_S3	The fair value of loans is adjusted for the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P103_S4	The carrying value of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) The fair value of impaired loans is based on either the estimated fair value of underlying collateral or estimated cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective rate.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	Assumptions regarding credit risk and cash flows are determined using available market information and specific borrower information.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	Deposits: The fair values for demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date represented by their carrying amount.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates offered at each reporting date by the Bank for certificates with similar remaining maturities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Repurchase agreements: The carrying amount of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair value of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures was determined based on the current market value for like kind instruments of a similar maturity and structure.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P107_S3	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P107_S4	For these commitments, there is no significant difference between the committed amounts and their fair values and therefore, these items are not included in the table above.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model- based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P112_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P112_S3	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value: Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P116_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P116_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2011 or 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P116_S3	There were no transfers between levels during the year ended December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2011 are summarized below:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2010 are summarized below: The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class of assets above.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or loans that have been subject to partial charge-offs are generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P121_S2	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P121_S3	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Total losses of $1,417,000 and $1,356,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P123_S2	These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P123_S3	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P123_S4	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following: Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $268,000 were recorded, net of $110,000 in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company sold twenty-seven available-for-sale securities for $29,404,000, recording a $666,000 gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S2	No securities were sold at a loss.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S3	Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $88,000 were recorded, net of $36,000 in tax benefit, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity at December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company sold sixty-five available-for-sale securities for $40,902,000, recording a $1,160,000 gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P124_S5	During 2009 we sold one available-for-sale investment security for $86,000, recording a $1,000 gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S1	Related to a significant deterioration in creditworthiness, during 2009 we sold five held-to maturity securities for $943,000, recording a $9,000 gain on sale.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S2	At December 31, 2009 the Company transferred all of its obligations of states and political subdivisions from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale as it was determined that management no longer had the intent to hold these investments to maturity.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S3	At the time of the transfer these securities had an amortized cost of $11,387,000 and a fair value of $11,722,000.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S4	There were no sales or transfers of held-to-maturity investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P125_S5	Investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	There were no securities in a loss position for more than one year as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company held 47 securities of which 12 were in a loss position.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P127_S1	Of the securities in a loss position, all were in a loss position for less than twelve months.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P127_S2	Of the 12 securities 7 are U.S. government-sponsored agencies and 5 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	When analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the historical and implied volatility of the security; the financial condition of the issuer of the security; and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	As of December 31, 2011, management does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	Based on the Company s evaluation of the above and other relevant factors, the Company does not believe the securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2011 are other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2011 by contractual maturity are shown below.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Investment securities with amortized costs totaling $44,878,000 and $36,828,000 and estimated fair values totaling $45,149,000 and $36,814,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits and repurchase agreements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	6. LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Outstanding loans are summarized below:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	The recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $24,402,000 and $28,755,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	The Company had specific allowances for loan losses of $2,066,000 on impaired loans of $14,130,000 at December 31, 2011 as compared to specific allowances for loan losses of $1,903,000 on impaired loans of $11,292,000 at December 31, 2010.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P135_S3	The average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $25,536,000, $20,833,000 and $25,092,000, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P135_S4	The Company recognized $666,000, $608,000 and $369,000 in interest income on a cash basis for impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Included in impaired loans are troubled debt restructurings.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	A troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan where the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	The concessions may be granted in various forms, including reduction in the stated interest rate, reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest, and extension of the maturity date.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company has allocated $1,164,000 and $271,000 of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	The Company has not committed to lend additional amounts on loans classified as troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the terms of certain loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S4	Modifications involving a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan were for periods ranging from 1 month to 2 years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S5	Modifications involving an extension of the maturity date were for periods ranging from 1 month to 10 years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S6	The following table presents loans by class modified as troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the twelve months ending December 31, 2011:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S7	The troubled debt restructurings described above increased the allowance for loan losses by $132,000 during the year ending December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P137_S8	The troubled debt restructurings described above did not result in charge offs during the year ending December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table presents loans by class modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the year ending December 31, 2011 A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	The troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted described above increased the allowance for loan losses by $81,000 and resulted in charge offs of $51,000 during the year ending December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The terms of certain other loans were modified during the year ending December 31, 2011 that did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	These loans have a total recorded investment as of December 31, 2011 of $13.5 million.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	The modification of these loans involved either a modification of the terms of a loan to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties or a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	This evaluation is performed under the company s internal underwriting policy.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Certain loans which were modified during the period ending December 31, 2011 and did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring as the modification was a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant had delays in payment ranging from 30 days to 2 months.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, nonaccrual loans totaled $16,757,000 and $25,313,000, respectively.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P155_S3	The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P155_S4	I s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 3.97% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P155_S6	The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable by the Company, subject to receipt by the Company of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on any quarterly anniversary date on or after the 5-year anniversary date of the issuance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P155_S7	The redemption price is par plus accrued and unpaid interest, except in the case of redemption under a special event which is defined in the debenture.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P155_S8	The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption to the extent of any early redemption of the Subordinated Debentures and upon maturity of the Subordinated Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to a cumulative cash distribution on the liquidation amount of $1,000 per security.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P156_S2	The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P156_S3	Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Trust Preferred Securities were sold and issued in private transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	The Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the Trust Preferred Securities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	Since the second quarter of 2010, the Company has deferred regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities and has given notice of deferral each quarterly payment period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	While the Company has accrued for this obligation, it is currently deferring the interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the agreements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities was $569,000 and $243,000, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P158_S2	Interest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to the subordinated debentures was $326,000, $312,000 and $371,000, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases The Company has commitments for leasing premises under the terms of noncancelable operating leases expiring from 2012 to 2015.

1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S3	The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S4	The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P161_S5	The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P163_S2	Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, inventory, equipment, income-producing commercial properties, farm land and residential properties.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S4	At December 31, 2011, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 21% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S5	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 33% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S6	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 46% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S7	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S8	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S9	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S10	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectibility of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P164_S11	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company s assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S3	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DFI, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S4	As of December 31, 2011, the Bank was restricted, without prior approval from the DFI, from paying cash dividends to the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S5	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 11 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S6	As described below, dividends on common stock are also limited related to the Company s participation in the Capital Purchase Program.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P166_S7	Additionally, Plumas Bancorp is required by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB) to obtain the FRB s prior written consent before paying any dividends on its common stock or its Series A Preferred Stock, or making any payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	Preferred Stock On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	The Warrant has a 10-year term and is exercisable, with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (Continued) The Company allocated the proceeds received on January 30, 2009 between the Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrant based on the estimated relative fair value of each.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	The fair value of the Warrant was estimated based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model and totaled $320,000.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	The discount recorded on the Series A Preferred Stock was based on a discount rate of 12% and will be amortized by the level-yield method over 5 years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P168_S3	Discount accretion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $87,000, $87,000 and $79,000, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and will pay cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P169_S2	With respect to dividends on the Company s common stock, Treasury s consent shall be required for any increase in common dividends per share until the third anniversary of the date of its investment unless prior to such third anniversary the Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole or the Treasury has transferred all of the Senior Preferred Series A Preferred Stock to third parties.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P169_S3	Furthermore, with respect to dividends on certain other series of preferred stock, restrictions from Treasury may apply.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company does not have any outstanding preferred stock other than the Series A Preferred Stock discussed above.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, Plumas Bancorp, as required by the FRB, suspended the declaration and payment of future quarterly cash dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	Plumas Bancorp is in arrears in the amount of $1,046,000 and $449,000 with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	When a net loss occurs, no difference in earnings per share is calculated because the conversion of potential common stock is anti-dilutive.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P174_S1	Stock options not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 483,000 and 312,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (Continued) Stock Options In 2001, the Company established a Stock Option Plan for which 482,780 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	The Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash or with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S3	The Plan does not provide for the settlement of awards in cash and new shares are issued upon option exercise.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S4	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S5	Upon grant, options vest ratably over a three to five year period.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S6	A summary of the activity within the Plan follows: As of December 31, 2011, there was $126,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S7	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1 years.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S8	The total fair value of options vested was $153,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S9	The total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S10	Cash received from options exercised for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $5,000.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P175_S11	There was no tax benefit realized from options exercised in 2009.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (Continued) Regulatory Capital The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P176_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S3	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S4	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S5	In addition, under the Consent Order that was in place until February 15, 2012 the Bank was subject to a minimum 10% Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum 13% total risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 2011.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P177_S6	Currently under an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI the Bank has agreed to maintain its Tier 1 leverage ratio at or above 9%.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P181_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P182_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P182_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_12_ITEM15_P182_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.

1168455_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, extended hours, remote deposit operations and drive-up banking, all provided with a high level of customer service.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $13,000 at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P14_S4	However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	These include cashier s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers, on-line banking, remote deposit, mobile banking and other customary banking services.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage while providing the customer with the opportunity to grow their savings through monthly monetary rewards for green behavior.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	The balance in this product at December 31, 2012 was $7.4 million.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn commercial lending office, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	We offer various loan products which promote home ownership and affordable housing, encourage job growth and support community economic development.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, and government-guaranteed community infrastructure loans.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P21_S6	Capital Purchase Program TARP Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and pays cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	The Warrant has a 10-year term and was immediately exercisable with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Prior to January 30, 2012, unless the Company has redeemed the Series A Preferred Stock, or the Treasury has transferred the Series A Preferred Stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required for the Company to: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of the Common Stock (other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than $0.04 per share or regular semi-annual cash dividends of not more than $0.08 per share); or (2) redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Common Stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	At the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB), Plumas Bancorp suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2012 the amount of the arrearage on the dividend payments of the Series A Preferred Stock is $1,643,000 representing eleven quarterly payments.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the Trust I ).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Debentures and trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly based on the floating rate described above on the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per security.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Company has entered into contractual agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee payment of: (1) accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the capital securities; (2) the redemption price with respect to any capital securities called for redemption by either Trust I or Trust II, and (3) payments due upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up, or liquidation of either Trust I or Trust II.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2012 the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $906,000 representing eleven quarterly payments.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	On March 15, 2013, with the approval of the FRB, the Company made all current and deferred interest payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Effective February 8, 2012, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requests that the Bank maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	The FDIC and DFI terminated the informal agreement effective January 24, 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the "FRB Agreement").
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp has agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement requires prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, the FRB Agreement requires Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	The Company submitted the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	See Note 2 Regulatory Matters of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information related to the Order and FRB Agreement.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Banks' assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	However, at December 31, 2012 approximately 78% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	Currently, within the Bank s branch service area there are 63 banking branch offices of competing institutions, including 30 branches of 8 major banks.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	As of June 30, 2012, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 65%, Quincy 59%, Portola 56%, Alturas 45%, Fall River Mills 36%, Kings Beach 31%, Susanville 24%,Truckee 15%, Tahoe City 8%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Redding is the location of our most recently opened branch, which became operational in June 2007.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P44_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company and its subsidiary employed 151 persons.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 138 persons.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including Plumas Bancorp s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	This Code of Ethics Policy is available on Plumas Bancorp s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P47_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, the Company is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	As a bank holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Federal and State Bank Regulation .
1168455_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Bank, as a state chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the California Department of Financial Institutions, the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	The California Department of Financial Institutions regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	As of the most recent CRA examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	W. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	We believe that the Bank is in compliance with these standards.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Substantially all deposits with the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system to set quarterly insurance premium assessments which categorizes banks into four risk categories based on capital levels and supervisory CAMELS ratings and names them Risk Categories I, II, III and IV.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	The CAMELS rating system is based upon an evaluation of the six critical elements of an institution s operations: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to risk.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	This rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and operational factors financial institution examiners assess in their evaluation of an institution s performance.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	The following table sets forth these four Risk Categories:
1168455_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Within Risk Category I, the assessment system combines supervisory ratings with other risk measures to differentiate risk.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	For most institutions, the assessment system combines CAMELS component ratings with financial ratios to determine an institution s assessment rate.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	The base assessment rates as of April 1, 2011 (which are still in effect as of December 31, 2012) are as follows (expressed in terms of cents per $100 in insured deposits):
1168455_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	* Initial base rates that were not the minimum or maximum rates will vary between these rates.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	After applying all possible adjustments, minimum and maximum total base assessment rates for each Risk Category are as follows:
1168455_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	* Total base assessment rates do not include the depository institution debt adjustment.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	The unsecured debt adjustment cannot exceed the lesser of 5 basis points or 50% of an insured depository institution s initial base assessment rate.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to take such steps as necessary to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	In setting the assessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments so that assessments will be based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC on a semi-annual or more frequent basis will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	Further increases in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending upon the amount of the increase.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also permanently raised the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified deposit account.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	In November 2008, the FDIC approved the final ruling establishing the Transaction Account Guarantee Program ( TAGP ) as part of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLGP ).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Under this program, all non-interest bearing transaction accounts became fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	This unlimited coverage also extended to NOW (interest bearing deposit accounts) earning an interest rate no greater than 0.50% and all IOLTAs (lawyers trust accounts).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P67_S3	TAGP was extended with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act providing for unlimited deposit insurance for noninterest bearing transactions accounts (excluding NOW, but including IOLTAs) expiring on December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the Bank s liquidity position would likely be affected by deposit withdrawal activity.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P70_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P70_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Since December 31, 1992, the FRB and the FDIC have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 8%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 4%.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S4	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P71_S5	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FRB and/or DFI to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	As discussed above, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital, as is the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and Bancorp as of December 31, 2012 follow:
1168455_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all of the above capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	The Company could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these regulatory capital guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	Banks with capital ratios below the required minimums are subject to certain administrative actions, including prompt corrective action, the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	During 2012 the federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint proposed rules that implement Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Reform Act.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	"Basel III" refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010 and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	The proposed rules received extensive comments.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S3	In a joint press release issued in November 2012, the agencies stated that they do not expect any of the proposed rules to become effective on the original target date of January 1, 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S4	Industry participants are expecting further guidance in early 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P78_S5	Management has completed a preliminary assessment of the impact of the proposed rules and believes Plumas Bank's ratios would be in compliance with the requirements of the proposed rules if they were presently in effect.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the ECOA ) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Truth in Lending Act (the TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	As a result of Dodd Frank, Regulation Z promulgated under TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Fair Housing Act (the FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	The HMDA also includes a "fair lending" aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act (the RFPA ) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (the RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S4	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P85_S5	Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with CRA, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, HMDA, RFPA and RESPA generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	Federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time, and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	The following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ), signed into law in July, 2010, will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act creates of a new interagency council, the Financial System Oversight Council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the U.S. economy posed by systemically significant, large financial companies, including bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	The Office of Thrift Supervision will be eliminated and its powers distributed among the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P87_S4	The Dodd-Frank Act additionally creates a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to have a significant impact on our banks operations as its provisions take effect.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	Among the provisions that may affect the Bank are the following: Deposit Insurance The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and extends unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts and interest on lawyers trust accounts through December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P88_S3	Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Interstate Branching The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P91_S2	Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	Limits on Derivatives The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits state chartered banks from engaging in derivatives transactions unless the loans to one borrower limits of the state in which the bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivatives transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	For this purpose, derivative transactions include any contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based in whole or in part on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders The Dodd-Frank Act expands the definition of affiliate for purposes of quantitative and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or its affiliates.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act applies Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	Any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	The current exemption from Section 23A for transactions with financial subsidiaries will be eliminated.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P94_S3	The Dodd-Frank Act will additionally prohibit an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by disinterested directors.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	The Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ) has established standards for reasonable and proportional fees which take into account the costs of preventing fraud.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	The CFPB will have authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the EFTA ) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer ( EFT ) systems.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	The EFTA is implemented by the Federal Reserve's Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S3	Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S4	The new rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S5	The new rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S6	For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-timedebit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P100_S7	The Bank s compliance with the new Regulation E amendments may have an impact on the Bank s revenue from overdraft service fees and non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) charges.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still pending various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	Although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those provisions relating to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will increase the Bank s operating and compliance costs as it is likely that the Bank s existing regulatory agencies will adopt the same or similar consumer protections as the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will adopt.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	On June 21, 2010, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on incentive compensation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	The final guidance is largely unchanged from the FRB s preliminary guidance published in 2009, with the exception of a few adjustments/clarifications in response to feedback the FRB received during the open comment period.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	The guidance became effective on June 25, 2010 (the date published in the Federal Register, and applies to all banks.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S3	Except for the largest banking organizations, enforcement of this guidance will be handled through the supervisors regular risk-focused examination process.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S4	The guidance is principles-based, rather than prescriptive, and also identifies expectations of large banking organizations that go beyond what will be expected of community banks, and emphasizes that the application of the guidance should be scaled appropriately for the complexity of the organization and the extent to which incentive arrangements are utilized.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S5	The employees covered by the final guidance are senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of the organization s firm-wide activities or material business lines; individual employees, including non-executive employees, whose activities may expose the organization to material amounts of risk; and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who, in the aggregate, may expose the organization to material amounts of risk, even if no individual employee is likely to expose the organization to material risk.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P102_S6	The guidance provides for three principles for safe and sound incentive compensation arrangements:
1168455_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	Strong Corporate Governance: Banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the EFTA ) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer ( EFT ) systems.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	The EFTA is implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse ( ACH ) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S4	The new rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S5	The new rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S6	For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S7	The mandatory compliance date for the Regulation E amendments is July 1, 2010 provided that the Bank may continue to assess overdraft service fees or charges on existing customer accounts prior to August 15, 2010, without obtaining the consumer s affirmative consent.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P104_S8	The Bank s compliance with the new Regulation E amendments may have an impact on the Bank s revenue from overdraft service fees and non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) charges.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	In May 2009 the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	The new law permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	In implementing the law, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to (1) provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) make mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	The new law also authorizes the Secretary of HUD to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S4	The new law also amends the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S5	Also in May 2009, the Credit Card Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S6	The new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions, such as when a promotional rate ends, there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S7	Interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S8	Significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without 45 days' advance notice of the change.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S9	The new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers (such as utility companies and other creditors) for existing credit card balances, though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least 45 days' advance notice of the change.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S10	The new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S11	Opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S12	They have at least five years to pay the balance.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P105_S13	Credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under 21, unless they have adult co-signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	The new law requires card issuers to give card account holders "a reasonable amount of time" to make payments on monthly bills.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	That means payments would be due at least 21 days after they are mailed or delivered.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	Credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	When consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	Consumers must "opt in" to over-limit fees.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P107_S2	Those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P107_S3	Fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P107_S4	Finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	Fees on credit cards cannot exceed 25 percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling US economy.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S1	ARRA authorizes spending of $787 billion, including about $288 billion for tax relief, $144 billion for state and local relief aid, and $111 billion for infrastructure and science.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S2	In addition, ARRA includes additional executive compensation restrictions for recipients of funds from the US Treasury under the Troubled Assets Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( EESA ).
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S3	EESA was amended by ARRA to provide additional incentive compensation restrictions for financial institutions receiving TARP funds and also require additional corporate governance provisions with respect to limiting golden parachutes, lavish expenditures and requiring officer certifications of compliance and clawbacks for improperly earned incentive compensation at such institutions.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S4	In addition, EESA as amended by ARRA provides that for any TARP recipient, its annual meeting materials shall include a nonbinding shareholder approval proposal of executive compensation for shareholders to vote.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P109_S5	ARRA also provides $730 million to the SBA and makes changes to the agency s lending and investment programs so that they can reach more small businesses that need help.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	$375 million for temporarily eliminating fees on SBA-backed loans and raising SBA's guarantee percentage on some loans to 90 percent.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	$30 million for expanding SBA s Microloan program, enough to finance up to $50 million in new lending and $24 million in technical assistance grants to microlenders.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	On January 1, 2012, SB 664 (Committee on Banking and Financial Institutions, Chapter 243, Statutes of 2011) became operative.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	While some substantive changes were included in this legislation due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank federal legislation and some technical corrections that resulted from earlier amendments to the Code, the majority of the work involved in SB 664 was to reorder the section numbering in the Code.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P112_S2	Among other things, the law requires a bank that establishes a branch office in this state in accordance with the National Bank Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to provide a specified notice to the Commissioner of DFI within 10 days of the establishment, relocation, or redesignation of offices.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	In 2010, California SB 931 was enacted and provides that the first lien holder of a California residential loan accepts as full payment and satisfaction of such lien after the successful completion of the short sale of such residence, and furthermore such lender is prevented from pursuing a deficiency against the noncorporate borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P113_S1	In 2011, the benefits of SB 931 was extended to such borrowers with a second or subordinate lien in SB458 where such lien holder agreed to the short sale.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	In California, the enactment of AB329 in 2009, the Reverse Mortgage Elder Protection Act of 2009 prohibits a lender or any other person who participates in the origination of the mortgage from participation in, being associated with, or employing any party that participates in or is associated with any other financial or insurance activity or referring a prospective borrower to anyone for the purchase of other financial or insurance products; and imposes certain disclosure requirements on the lender.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	The enactment of AB1160 in 2009, requires a supervised financial institution in California that negotiates primarily in any of a number of specified languages in the course of entering into a contract or agreement for a loan or extension of credit secured by residential real property, to deliver, prior to the execution of the contract or agreement, and no later than 3 business days after receiving the written application, a specified form in that language summarizing the terms of the contract or agreement; provides for administrative penalties for violations; and requires the California Department of Corporations and the Department of Financial Institutions to create a form for providing translations and make it available in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	The statute becomes operative on July 1, 2010, or 90 days after issuance of the form, whichever occurs later.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	The enactment of AB 1291 in 2009 makes changes to the California Unclaimed Property Law including (among other things): allowing electronic notification to customers who have consented to electronic notice; requiring that notices contain certain information and allow the holder to provide electronic means to enable the owner to contact the holder in lieu of returning the prescribed form to declare the owner s intent; authorizing the holder to give additional notices; and requiring, beginning January 1, 2011, a banking or financial organization to provide a written notice regarding escheat at the time a new account or safe deposit box is opened.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	The enactment of SB306 makes specified changes to clarify existing law related to filing a notice of default on residential real property in California, including (among other things): clarifying that the provisions apply to mortgages and deeds of trust recorded from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, secured by owner-occupied 3 4 residential real property containing no more than 4 dwelling units; revising the declaration to be filed with the notice of default; specifying how the loan servicers have to maximize net present value under their pooling and servicing agreements applies to certain investors; specifying how and when the notice to residents of property subject to foreclosure is to be mailed; and extending the time during which the notice of sale must be recorded from 14 to 20 days.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	The bill also makes certain changes related to short-pay agreements and short-pay demand statements.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	On February 20, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger signed ABX2 7 and SBX2 7, which established the California Foreclosure Prevention Act.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P117_S1	The California Foreclosure Prevention Act modifies the foreclosure process to provide additional time for borrowers to work out loan modifications while providing an exemption for mortgage loan servicers that have implemented a comprehensive loan modification program.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P117_S2	Civil Code Section 2923.52 requires an additional 90 day period beyond the period already provided before a Notice of Sale can be given in order to allow all parties to pursue a loan modification to prevent foreclosure of loans meeting certain criteria identified in that section.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	A mortgage loan servicer who has implemented a comprehensive loan modification program may file an application for exemption from the provisions of Civil Code Section 2923.52.
1168455_13_ITEM1_P118_S1	Approval of this application provides the mortgage loan servicer an exemption from the additional 90-day period before filing the Notice of Sale when foreclosing on real property covered by the new law.

1168455_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	The decline in rental expense during 2010 resulted from the purchase of our Redding branch building on March 31, 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	Previously we had leased this building.
1168455_13_ITEM2_P2_S4	Under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time; however, in accordance with accounting principles we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months.
1168455_13_ITEM2_P2_S5	At the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a $184 thousand reduction in rental expense.

1168455_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As a bank holding company without significant assets other than its equity position in the Bank, the Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends primarily upon dividends it receives from the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.

1168455_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity's proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Overview The Company recorded net income of $1.95 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a 107% increase over net income of $941 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Net interest income increased by $331 thousand from $16.8 million during 2011 to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	This increase in net interest income resulted from a decrease in interest expense of $574 thousand partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $243 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	The provision for loan losses declined by $1.1 million from $3.5 million during 2011 to $2.4 million during 2012 resulting in an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $1.5 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012 non-interest income decreased by $566 thousand to $6.6 million, from $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S5	This decrease was related to declines of $615 thousand in gain on sale of loans and $263 thousand in gain on sale of securities partially offset by an increase of $140 thousand in service charge income and a net increase in all other categories of non-interest income totaling $172 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	We continue to achieve savings in many categories of non-interest expense resulting in a reduction in non-interest expense of $869 thousand from $19.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $18.4 million during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S7	Reductions of $227 thousand in salary and benefits expense, $486 thousand in FDIC insurance, $590 thousand in loss on sale of OREO, $235 thousand in OREO expense, and $86 thousand in postage were partially offset by an increase in the provision for changes in valuation of OREO of $328 thousand, an increase in outside service fees of $233 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $145 thousand and an increase in insurance expense of $78 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P14_S8	The provision for income taxes increased from $295 thousand in 2011 to $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Net income allocable to common shareholders increased by $1 million from $257 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2011 to $1.3 million during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income allocable to common shareholders is calculated by subtracting dividends and discount amortized on preferred stock from net income.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Total assets at December 31, 2012 were $478 million, an increase of $22.5 million from $455 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Increases included $23.0 million in investments and $22.8 million in net loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	These were partially offset by declines of $18.4 million in cash, $3.3 million in OREO and $1.6 million in other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Core deposit growth has been strong in 2012 as evidenced by increases of $17.7 million in demand deposits and $11.1 million in savings and money market accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	Time deposits declined by $9.8 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	Shareholders equity increased by $2.2 million from $39.6 million at December 31, 2011 to $41.8 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	This increase includes the $1.95 million earned in 2012, a $171 thousand increase in unrealized gain on investment securities and a $95 thousand increase in common stock related to stock-based compensation expense.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	The return on average assets was 0.42% for 2012, up from 0.20% for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	The return on average common equity was 4.3% for 2012, up from 0.9% for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	(1) Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	(4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	(5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, up $331 thousand, or 2%, from $16.8 million for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	A decrease of $243 thousand, or 1.3% in interest income, from $18.7 million during 2011 to $18.4 million during the current year, was offset by a decline in interest expense of $574 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	Interest and fees on loans increased by $27 thousand; however, this was offset by a $252 thousand decline in interest on investment securities and an $18 thousand decline in interest on deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in yield partially offset by a decrease in average loan balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	Interest on investments securities declined related to a decrease in yield partially offset by an increase in average balance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	Interest and fees on loans was $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S7	The average loan balances were $301.8 million for 2012, down $1.0 million from the $302.8 million for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S8	This decline in loans was mostly related to normal pay downs and prepayments, loan charge-offs and real estate acquired through foreclosure mostly offset by growth in our auto loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S9	The average yields on loans were 5.77% for 2012 up from 5.75% for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S10	As a result of a decrease in yield of 64 basis points from 1.92% during 2011 to 1.28% during 2012, interest on investment securities decreased by $252 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S11	The effect of the decrease in yield on interest income was partially offset by an increase in average investment securities of $10.2 million from $59.4 million during 2011 to $69.6 million during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P26_S12	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Interest income on interest-bearing deposits, which totaled $106 thousand in 2012 and $124 thousand in 2011, mostly relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $622 thousand, or 42%, to $847 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, down from $1.5 million in 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	This decrease primarily relates to decreases in the average balance and rate paid on time and interest bearing demand deposits (NOW) and a decline in the rate paid on money market accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Interest on time deposits declined by $548 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Average time deposits declined by $20.9 million from $97.0 million during 2011 to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	The decrease in average time deposits is mostly related to a promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	During 2011 the average balance of promotional deposits was $21.8 million; these promotional time deposits had all matured by December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S6	The average rate paid on promotional deposits during 2011 was 2%.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S7	In addition, the Bank has held down the rate paid on time deposits in 2012 as it has excess liquidity and does not need to pay for deposits at above market rates.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S8	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.09% during 2011 to 0.67% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S9	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of the higher rate promotional deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S10	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $76 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S11	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 7 basis points from 0.20% during 2011 to 0.13% during 2012, mostly related to a decline in market rates in the Company s service area.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S12	Average balances declined by $11.3 million from 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S13	During 2011 we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts as we determined that the previous rate did not meet our profitability targets, as a result some of these deposits moved out of the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S14	During 2012 average public NOW accounts declined by $7.4 million from $24.3 million during 2011 to $16.9 million during the year ended December 21, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S15	At December 31, 2012 balances in this account type were $11.8 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S16	We do not expect significant additional declines in public NOW balances during 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S17	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $24 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 8 basis points from 0.29% during 2011 to 0.21% during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S18	This was primarily related to a money market sweep product we offered in 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S19	We no longer offer the money market sweep account having replaced it with a product that utilizes repurchase agreements during the third quarter of 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S20	Average money market balances increased by $2.9 million from $40.0 million during 2011 to $42.9 million in 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P28_S21	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $18 thousand from 2011, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Interest on other borrowings primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2012 increased 10 basis points to 4.18%, from 4.08% for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decline of $0.7 million, or 4.1%, from $17.5 million for 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	The overall change in net interest income was primarily a result of a decrease of $1.5 million in loan interest income and a decline of $628 thousand in interest income on investment securities.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	The decline in interest on loans was mostly related to a decline in average loans outstanding.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	Interest on investment securities declined related to a decrease in both yield and average balance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S6	Partially offsetting these decreases in interest income was a decline in rates paid on the Company s deposits and a decline in the average balance of time deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and long-term borrowings.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S7	Interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 9.7%, to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S8	Interest and fees on loans decreased by $1.5 million from $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $17.4 million for 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S9	The average loan balances were $302.8 million for 2011, down $21.1 million from the $323.9 million for 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S10	This decline in loans was mostly related to normal pay downs and prepayments, loan charge-offs, real estate acquired through foreclosure and our efforts to reduce the level of construction and land development loan balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P30_S11	The average yields on loans were 5.75% for 2011 down from the 5.82% for 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest on investment securities decreased by $628 thousand resulting from a decrease in yield of 63 basis points and a decline in average investment securities of $9.9 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $124 thousand in 2011 and $48 thousand in 2010, relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $1.2 million, or 46%, to $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, down from $2.7 million in 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	This decrease primarily relates to decreases in the average balance and rate paid on time deposits and a decline in the rate paid on demand deposit (NOW) and money market accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Interest on time deposits declined by $946 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	Average time deposits declined by $27.8 million from $124.8 million during 2010 to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	The decrease in time deposits is mostly related to promotional time deposits as previously discussed.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	The average rate paid on these promotional deposits during 2011 was 2%.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S7	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.61% during 2010 to 1.09% during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S8	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of the higher rate promotional deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S9	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $195 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S10	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 18 basis points from 0.38% during 2010 to 0.20% during 2011, as we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S11	Although we lost deposits by lowering this rate; we continue to focus on the profitability of the public sweep accounts rather than growing public sweep balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S12	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $106 thousand related primarily to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 23 basis points from 0.52% during 2010 to 0.29% during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S13	This was primarily related to a significant drop in the rates paid on our money market sweep product.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S14	Interest on FHLB long term borrowings decreased by $130 thousand as there were no outstanding long term borrowings during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S15	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $14 thousand from 2010, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P32_S16	Interest on other borrowings in 2011 primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2011 decreased 16 basis points to 4.08%, from 4.24% for 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Provision for Loan Losses During the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.35 million down $1.15 million from the $3.50 million provision recorded during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to repay their loan.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 non-interest income decreased by $566 thousand to $6.6 million from $7.2 million during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $615 thousand in gains on the sale of government guaranteed loans from $1.9 million during 2011 to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, related to a change in SBA requirements, guaranteed portions of SBA loans were no longer required to be sold with a 90 day premium recourse requirement.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	This resulted in recording gains on sales of loans during 2011 representing both loans sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and loans sold during the fourth quarter of 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, gain on sale of loans during 2011benefited from a government program temporarily increasing the government guarantee in order to stimulate small business lending.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	The remaining decrease in non-interest income was related to a decline in gains on sale of investment securities from $666 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $403 thousand during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	During the 2011 period proceeds of $29.4 million were generated on the sale of twenty-seven securities and during the 2012 proceeds of $20.8 million were received on the sale of twenty-five securities.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $140 thousand primarily related to an increase in use of overdraft protection services.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2011 we introduced a new overdraft protection (ODP) program which we made available to a larger portion of our customer base than the prior program, resulting in an increase in service fee income.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	This new program has enabled us to increase income while strengthening our regulatory compliance over the ODP function.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	The increase in other non-interest income mostly relates to a $99 thousand adjustment to accrued life insurance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2011 non-interest income decreased by $1.3 million to $7.2 million, from $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P40_S10	This decrease was related to the sale of our merchant processing portfolio in 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	During June 2010 we entered into an alliance with a world-wide merchant processing leader.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	In conjunction with this alliance we sold our merchant processing business, recording a one-time gain of $1.4 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Related to this sale we experienced a decrease in merchant processing income of $126 thousand during the comparison periods.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	Service charges on deposit accounts declined by $165 thousand primarily related to a decline in overdraft fees as new regulations placed additional restrictions on the Bank in charging overdraft fees on ATM and Point of Sale transactions.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	Gain on sale of investments declined by $494 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011 we sold twenty-seven investment securities classified as available-for-sale for $29.4 million recognizing a $0.7 million gain on sale.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	During the 2010 period we sold sixty-five investment securities classified as available-for sale for $40.9 million and recorded a $1.2 million gain on sale.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We chose to sell some of the securities in our investment portfolio in order to lock in gains; this had the additional benefit of partially offsetting some nonrecurring expense items such as losses on sale of OREO.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Partially offsetting these declines in income was an $884 thousand increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gains on sale in 2011 were particularly strong related to two factors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	First, during the first quarter of 2011 the SBA eliminated the recourse provision related to loan sales allowing us to record both gains on sales from loans sold during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, many loans sold in 2011 were 90% guaranteed related to a temporary increase in guarantee percentage enacted on February 17, 2009 as part of the Recovery Act.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Currently loans made through the SBA 7(a) program carry a 75% to 85% guarantee.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	We continue to achieve savings in many categories of non-interest expense resulting in a reduction in non-interest expense of $869 thousand from $19.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $18.4 million during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Significant reductions in salary and benefits expense, FDIC insurance, loss on sale of OREO, OREO expense, and postage were partially offset by an increase in the provision for changes in valuation of OREO of $328 thousand, an increase in outside service fees of $233 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $145 thousand and an increase in insurance expense of $78 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $227 thousand related to a decline of $80 thousand in commission expense, $88 thousand in medical and dental insurance expense (group insurance), $50 thousand in workers compensation expense and an increase of $247 thousand in deferred loan origination costs partially offset by an increase of $92 thousand in salary continuation expense and $131 thousand in stock compensation expense.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	Commission expense, which relates to government-guaranteed lending personnel, decreased by $80 thousand consistent with the decline in government-guaranteed loan sales during the comparison periods.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	The decrease in group insurance was mostly related to a decline in employees enrolled in the insurance plans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	The decrease in workers compensation was related to changing providers.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	Previously we were members of a small group plan and our premiums were adversely affected by claims within the group.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P45_S7	We have exited this plan and have seen a considerable reduction in workers compensation premiums.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Related to an increase in lending activity, the deferral of loan origination costs increased by $247 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	During 2012, related to a significant reduction in long term market interest rates, we reduced the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our salary continuation liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	This had the effect of increasing salary continuation expense by $195 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Absent this adjustment salary continuation expense would have declined by $103 thousand, as salary continuation expense during 2011 included a one-time adjustment to reflect the early retirement of the Company s Chief Credit officer.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Employee stock compensation expense increased by $131 thousand from a credit of $38 thousand during 2011 to expense of $93 thousand during the current period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	The credit in stock compensation expense during the 2011 period was related to a revision in the estimated forfeiture rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	We expect a reduction in stock compensation expense in 2013 as the unamortized balance continues to decline.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	A decline of $486 thousand in FDIC insurance expense relates to a decline in the rate charged Plumas Bank by the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	This decline in rate includes a change in the assessment base and assessment rate under new rules enacted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P47_S8	These new rules changed the assessment base from total deposits to average total assets less tangible capital, but also significantly lowered the assessment rates, causing a net favorable impact on our FDIC insurance premiums.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Loss on sale of OREO totaled $16 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $590 thousand from the $606 thousand incurred in 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	In the second quarter of 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented approximately half of its OREO holdings at that time.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on sale of this large OREO holding in 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	OREO expense declined by $235 thousand from $422 thousand during 2011 to $187 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S5	OREO expense benefited from a decline in OREO balances in 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S6	In addition, 2011 OREO expense was adversely affected by significant cleanup costs on one property and considerable legal costs related to another property.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S7	Both of these properties where sold during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S8	Postage declined by $86 thousand related to the outsourcing of our statement processing activities during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P48_S9	Effective with the outsourcing, the cost of mailing statements, notices and similar documents is included in outside service costs.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	The allowance is established through a provision for subsequent losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are recorded in other income or expenses as incurred.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S4	The $907 thousand in OREO provision, an increase of $328 thousand from $579 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, was related to a decline in the value of twenty-one properties based on appraisals received during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S5	Of these twenty-one properties, seven have been sold and the remaining fourteen represent 61% of the Bank s OREO balance as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S6	The largest component of the $233 thousand increase in outside service costs was $112 thousand in costs related to the outsourcing of our statement processing operations in June, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S7	The Company anticipates meaningful savings, related to the statement outsourcing.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S8	During 2012 the Bank modernized its ATM network by purchasing new ATM machines which have the ability to accept currency and checks and provide an imaged receipt.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S9	A large portion of the remaining increase in outside service costs relates to maintaining these advanced machines which are considerably more complicated than our previous ATMs many of which were over ten years old.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S10	The $145 thousand increase in professional fees mostly relates to an increase in consulting costs in the Company s data processing and network administration functions.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P49_S11	Insurance expense was abnormally low during 2011 as it included the reversal of the accrual for split dollar life insurance for the Bank s former Chief Credit Officer who forfeited his right to this insurance when he left the Bank prior to reaching the age of sixty-five.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	While we have achieved savings in many categories of non-interest expense these were offset in 2011 by an increase of $649 thousand in loss on sale of OREO.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Non-interest expense increased by $105 thousand from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $19.2 million during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Loss on sale of OREO totaled $606 thousand primarily related to the sale of one property.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	During June, 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented $4.3 million, or 48% of the total balance in OREO at January 1, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on sale; however, management believes the loss was prudent given the significant affect this transaction had in decreasing nonperforming assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	Outside service fees increased by $58 thousand which mostly relates to our on-line banking and bill payment platform.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	FDIC insurance costs increased related to an increase in the rate the FDIC charges Plumas Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P50_S7	Professional fees increased by $143 thousand the largest portion of which was related to an increase in consulting cost of $97 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	During the second half of 2011 we contracted with an outside party to provide assistance in the management of our nonperforming assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Total costs incurred related to this consultant were $42 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	In addition we incurred $21 thousand in costs related to an outside management study.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The largest reduction in expense was a decrease of $537 thousand in salaries and employee benefits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	Salary expense, excluding commissions, declined by $667 thousand mostly related to a reduction in staffing, during the second quarter of 2010, which affected most functional areas with the exception of government guaranteed lending and problem assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 142 persons at December 31, 2011 down from 146 at December 31, 2010 and 163 at December 31, 2009.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S6	Commission expense, which relates to government guaranteed lending personnel and is included in salary expense, increased by $318 thousand resulting from the increase in government guaranteed loan gains.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S7	The provision for OREO losses increased by $223 thousand related to one land development property that, based on a 2011 appraisal, declined in value by $417 thousand.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P51_S8	At December 31, 2011, this property had a value of approximately $1 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	OREO carrying costs declined by $151 thousand from $573 thousand during 2010 to $422 thousand during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	These savings were primarily related to property taxes on OREO properties and refunds on prior year tax payments related to some of our OREO properties being reassessed.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Insurance expense declined by $83 thousand primarily related to the forfeiture of retirement split dollar life insurance benefits by one of our executive officers who chose to terminate his employment during 2011 prior to age sixty-five.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Other non-interest expense declined by $228 thousand related to a $226 thousand prepayment penalty incurred upon the prepayment of our long-term Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings during July, 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $1.1 million, or 35.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	During 2011 the Company recorded an income tax provision of $295 thousand, or 23.9% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The percentages for 2012 and 2011 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance, municipal loan interest, and in the state of California enterprise zone interest decrease taxable income.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	As part of its analysis, the Company considered the following positive evidence:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company has a long history of earnings and profitability.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company has been profitable for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Additionally, the Company is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The volume of potential problem loans in the Company s loan portfolio has significantly decreased.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company does not have a history of net operating losses carry forwards or tax credits expiring unused.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is "more likely than not" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	These commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	The Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans and residential real estate loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S5	These categories accounted for approximately 44.3%, 11.1% and 11.0%, respectively of the Company's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2012, and approximately 40.6%, 13.2% and 13.3%, respectively of the Company's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S6	Construction and land development loans continue to decline and represented 5.0% and 5.8% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S7	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P61_S8	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio reflects management s continued efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 78% and 81% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P62_S5	In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, approximately 73% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $35 million at December 31, 2012 and $39 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	(2) Includes agriculture real estate The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	The Board s Loan Committee reviews the asset quality of new loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P67_S5	In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	It consists of members of executive management and credit administration management, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S4	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P69_S5	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Effective for the third quarter of 2012, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	This modification incorporated historical losses from the beginning of the latest business cycle.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	Previously we utilized historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	This modification had the effect of increasing the required allowance by approximately $250,000 for 2012 related to the expanded historical loss period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	The Company believes that, given the recent trend in historical losses, it was prudent to increase the period examined and that a full business cycle was the appropriate period.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company's allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.35 million down $1.15 million from the $3.50 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Net charge-offs totaled $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 and $3.9 million during 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 1.29% during 2011 to 1.18% during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses: The allowance for loan losses totaled $5.7 million at December 31, 2012 and $6.9 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S5	Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased from $2.1 million at December 31, 2011 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S6	This decline in specific reserves is reflected in the $3.6 million in net charge-offs during 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S7	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it reverses the specific reserve and takes a partial charge-off in its place.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S8	General reserves decreased by $342 thousand to $4.5 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S9	Related to a decline in specific and general reserves, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 2.35% at December 31, 2011 to 1.80% at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P76_S10	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans decreased from 1.80% at December 31, 2011 to 1.52% at December 31, 2012 primarily related to a decrease in the historical charge-off rate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled $9.3 million, $8.4 million, $2.0 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	There were no troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2008.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 6 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company's nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 were $13.7 million, a decrease of $3.1 million from the $16.8 million balance at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The decline of $3.1 million includes $1.3 million in loans transferred to OREO, charge-offs and principal repayments on nonperforming loans partially offset by $5.6 million in additional loans placed on nonperforming status.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $976 thousand at December 31, 2012 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days decreased from $5.1 million at December 31, 2011 to $2.8 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $10.6 million from $29.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $18.6 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased as well from $10.7 million at December 31, 2011 to $6.7 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	At December 31, 2012, $8.4 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company's recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $18.8 million and $24.4 million, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S6	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $1.2 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P85_S7	Additionally, $3.0 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2012 and $940 thousand at December 31 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2012 is appropriate.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	Repossessed assets and OREO are carried at fair market value, less selling costs.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	OREO holdings represented forty properties totaling $5.3 million at December 31, 2012 and forty-four properties totaling $8.6 million at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	During June, 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented $4.3 million, or 48% of the total balance in OREO at January 1, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S5	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on this 2011sale; however, management believes the loss was prudent given the significant affect this transaction had in decreasing nonperforming assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S6	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 3.98% at December 31, 2012 and 5.60% at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P87_S7	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	Total investment securities increased by $23.0 million from $57.9 million at December 31, 2011 to $80.9 million as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	The increase in investment securities is consistent with our asset/liability management policy as we chose to reduce excess balances held at the FRB in order to increase our return on these balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was invested entirely in U.S. Government-sponsored agencies.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2012 or 2011; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) totaling $24.5 million at December 31, 2012 and $47.8 million at December 31, 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	These balances currently earn 25 basis points.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company's investment securities held on the dates indicated: The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company's securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Total deposits were $411.5 million as of December 31, 2012, up $20.4 million, or 5%, from the December 31, 2011 balance of $391.1 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by $17.7 million, interest bearing transaction accounts (NOW) increased by $1.4 million, savings accounts increased by $6.2 million and money market accounts increased by $4.9 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	Time deposits declined by $9.8 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S4	We attribute much of the reduction in time to the unusually low interest rate environment as we have seen a movement out of time into more liquid deposits types.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S5	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S6	The deposit mix changed slightly from December 31, 2011 as time deposits and NOW accounts declined as a percentage of total deposits and we had an increase in other deposit types.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S7	Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 35% of total deposits at December 31, 2012 and 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S8	Interest bearing transaction accounts were 20% of total deposits at December 31, 2012 and 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S9	Money market and savings deposits totaled 28% of total deposits at December 31, 2012 and 26% at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S10	Time deposits were 17% of total deposits at December 31, 2012 and 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S11	Deposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S12	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P91_S13	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company's time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2012:
1168455_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company's local business and individual customer base.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	The potential impact on the Company's liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company's asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $98,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $191,000,000.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Company held $1,950,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $41,000,000.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P94_S5	To borrow the $98,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,661,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	In 2011 Plumas Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	The balance in this product at December 31, 2012 was $7.4 million.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Capital Resources Shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2012 totaled $41.9 million up from $39.6 million as of December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	On January 30, 2009, under the Capital Purchase Program, the Company sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Shares ) and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $7.54 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Ten million of the twelve million in proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock was injected into Plumas Bank providing addition capital for the bank to support growth in loans and investment securities and strengthen its capital ratios.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The remainder provided funds for holding company activities and general corporate purposes.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors (the Board).
1168455_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	No common cash dividends were paid in 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2012 and none are anticipated to be paid in 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities and suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Therefore, Plumas Bancorp is currently in arrears with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock and interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the related agreements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	As of December 31, 2012 the amount of the arrearage on the dividend payments of the Series A Preferred Stock is $1,643 thousand representing eleven quarterly payments and the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities is $906 thousand also representing eleven quarterly payments.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, with risk-based capital ratios calculated separately for the Company and the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	There are two categories of capital under the guidelines: Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders equity, and qualifying trust-preferred securities (including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other deductions, notably the unrealized net gains or losses (after tax adjustments) on available-for-sale investment securities carried at fair market value; Tier 2 capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	As noted previously, the Company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate $10 million in trust-preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	These trust-preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed 25% of total Tier 1 capital, but are classified as long-term debt in accordance with GAAP.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust-preferred securities (and/or related subordinated debentures) in the Tier I capital of bank holding companies.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (amounts in thousands except percentage amounts).
1168455_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank currently meet their entire capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized leverage, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of 5%, 6% and 10%, respectively, at all times.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	During 2012 the federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint proposed rules that implement Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Reform Act.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	"Basel III" refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010 and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	The proposed rules received extensive comments.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	In a joint press release issued in November 2012, the agencies stated that they do not expect any of the proposed rules to become effective on the original target date of January 1, 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	Industry participants are expecting further guidance in early 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P108_S5	Management has completed a preliminary assessment of the impact of the proposed rules and believes Plumas Bank's ratios would be in compliance with the requirements of the proposed rules if they were presently in effect.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $76.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $110 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	This compares to $79.2 million in unfunded loan commitments and $50 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S4	Of the $76.0 million in unfunded loan commitments, $34.3 million and $41.7 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2012, $33.2 million were secured by real estate, of which $7.8 million was secured by commercial real estate and $25.4 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P110_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company leases one depository branch, two lending offices and one loan administration office and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.

1168455_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	THE BUSINESS OF PLUMAS BANCORP During 2002, Plumas Bancorp (the Company ) was incorporated as a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring Plumas Bank (the Bank ) in a one bank holding company reorganization.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation, expansion and diversification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I ( Trust I ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust II ( Trust II ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 28, 2005.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Bank operates eleven branches in California, including branches in Alturas, Chester, Fall River Mills, Greenville, Kings Beach, Portola, Quincy, Redding, Susanville, Tahoe City, and Truckee.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Bank s administrative headquarters is in Quincy, California.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	In addition, the Bank operates a loan administrative office in Reno, Nevada and a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Bank's primary source of revenue is generated from providing loans to customers who are predominately small and middle market businesses and individuals residing in the surrounding areas.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), which, in part, permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	In addition, amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act extended unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts for an additional two years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	This unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts expired on December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS On February 15, 2012, the Bank received notice from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) that the Consent Order with the FDIC and the DFI which was effective on March 16, 2011 had been terminated.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	While the Bank is no longer subject to an Order, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requests that the Bank continue to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P16_S3	The FDIC and DFI terminated the informal agreement effective January 24, 2013.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB Agreement ).
1168455_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp has agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement requires prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	In addition, the FRB Agreement requires Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company has continued to submit the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	Plumas Statutory Trust I and Trust II are not consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	The Company's investment in Trust I of $290,000 and Trust II of $157,000 are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P19_S4	The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued and guaranteed by the Company and held by Trust I and Trust II are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	The accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances to conform to the classifications used in 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	These reclassifications had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or net change in cash and cash equivalents.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Segment Information Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Use of Estimates To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	As of December 31, 2012 all cash held with other federally insured institutions was fully insured by the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P25_S3	Net cash flows are reported for customer loans and deposit transactions and repurchase agreements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Investment Securities Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P28_S3	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	The term "other than temporary" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P29_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, FHLB stock totaled $1,950,000 and $2,043,000, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Loans Held for Sale, Loan Sales and Servicing Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 the Company had $3,367,000 and $3,091,000, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S4	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S5	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S6	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $58,696,000 and $47,708,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P31_S7	The Company also services loans previously sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) totaling $1,641,000 and $1,932,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S3	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S4	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S5	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P32_S6	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan, the servicing asset, the interest-only (IO) strip, and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	The servicing asset is recognized and amortized over the estimated life of the related loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S4	Assets (accounted for as IO strips) are recorded at the fair value of the difference between note rates and rates paid to purchasers (the interest spread) and contractual servicing fees, if applicable.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S5	IO strips are carried at fair value with gains or losses recorded as a component of shareholders equity, similar to available-for-sale investment securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P34_S6	Significant future prepayments of these loans will result in the recognition of additional amortization of related servicing assets and an adjustment to the carrying value of related IO strips.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Loans Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company's initial investment in the loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan's yield over its remaining life.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S4	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S5	The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P39_S6	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 (the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	During 2012, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	This modification incorporated historical losses from the beginning of the latest business cycle.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	Previously we utilized historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S4	This modification had the effect of increasing the required allowance related to the expanded historical loss period by $250,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P48_S5	The Company believes that, given the recent trend in historical losses, it was prudent to increase the period examined and that a full business cycle was the appropriate period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans and credit card receivables.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, with the exception of automobile and other loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows: Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management's close attention.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project's failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P56_S3	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P56_S4	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that are based on management's assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described on the next page.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Commercial Commercial loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than real estate portfolio segments because these loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower's ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers' capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S4	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S5	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S6	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P60_S7	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P61_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers' capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer and credit card loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	In addition, the Company's primary regulators, the FDIC and DFI, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P64_S5	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $141,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Other Real Estate Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $5,295,000 ($8,517,000 less a valuation allowance of $3,222,000) at December 31, 2012 and $8,623,000 ($11,668,000 less a valuation allowance of $3,045,000) at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $3,714,000, $4,937,000 and $3,462,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company recorded a loss on sale of other real estate owned of $16,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	This compares to a loss on sale of other real estate owned of $606,000 in 2011 and a gain on sale of $43,000 during 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S4	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank's recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S5	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S6	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P66_S7	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are recorded in other income or expenses as incurred.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over ten years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	There were no such events or circumstances in 2012 or 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Income Taxes The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P77_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S5	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P79_S6	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income less preferred dividends) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Dividend Restrictions Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	In addition, the Bank and the Bancorp cannot currently pay dividends without the prior approval of their primary regulators.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plan, net of related tax (expense)/benefit, recorded in 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $93,000, $(38,000) and $53,000 or $0.02, $(0.01) and $0.01 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P86_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	In May, 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. and International accounting principles.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	Overall, the guidance is consistent with existing U.S. accounting principles; however, there are some amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	The amendments in this guidance are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S3	The effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s operating results or financial condition, but the additional disclosures are included in Note 4.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S4	In June 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S5	The amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P89_S6	The amendments in this guidance are effective as of the beginning of a fiscal reporting year, and interim periods within that year, that begins after December 15, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The implementation of the amended accounting guidance changed the presentation of the components of comprehensive income for the Company from a component of the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity to a separate statement following the consolidated statement of income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P92_S2	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P92_S3	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 are as follows:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2).
1168455_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P101_S3	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P109_S1	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value: Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 are summarized below:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2012 or 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, U.S. Government-sponsored agencies were transferred to Level 2 from level 1of the fair value hierarchy as the Company currently values these securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2012 are summarized below:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2011 are summarized below:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or loans that have been subject to partial charge-offs are generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P117_S1	These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P117_S2	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P117_S3	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	Total losses of $2,044,000 and $1,417,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S2	These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S3	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S4	Once received, a member of the Appraisal Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S5	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P119_S6	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	In certain cases we use discounted cash flow or similar internal modeling techniques to determine the fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	Use of these techniques requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S2	Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S3	Certain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S4	Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S5	Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P120_S6	Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1168455_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $561,000 were recorded, net of $232,000 in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company sold twenty-five available-for-sale investment securities for $20,773,000, recording a $403,000 gain on sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P123_S2	No securities were sold at a loss.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $268,000 were recorded, net of $110,000 in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company sold twenty-seven available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $29,404,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	The Company realized a gain on sale from twenty-five of these securities totaling $690,000 and a loss on sale on two securities of $24,000 resulting in the recognition of a $666,000 net gain on sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company sold sixty-five available-for-sale securities for $40,902,000, and realized a $1,160,000 gain on sale.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S4	There were no transfers of available-for-sale investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P124_S5	There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	Investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	There were no securities in a loss position for more than one year as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company held 55 securities of which 8 were in a loss position.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	Of the securities in a loss position, all were in a loss position for less than twelve months.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	Of the 8 securities 2 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 6 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	When analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the historical and implied volatility of the security; the financial condition of the issuer of the security; and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	As of December 31, 2012, management does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P128_S2	Based on the Company s evaluation of the above and other relevant factors, the Company does not believe the securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2012 are other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2012 by contractual maturity are shown below.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	Investment securities with amortized costs totaling $44,305,000 and $44,878,000 and estimated fair values totaling $44,535,0 00 and $45,149,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits and repurchase agreements.

1168455_13_ITEM8_P134_S5	Included in impaired loans are troubled debt restructurings.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P134_S6	A troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan where the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P134_S7	The concessions may be granted in various forms to include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting policy.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	The carrying value of troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $12,296,000 and $12,188,000, respectively.

1168455_13_ITEM8_P143_S3	These loans which were modified during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring as the modification was a delay in a payment ranging from 30 days to 3 months that was considered to be insignificant or the borrower was not considered to be experiencing financial difficulties.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P143_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, nonaccrual loans totaled $13,683,000 and $16,757,000, respectively.

1168455_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows: Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P150_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P150_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P150_S3	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P150_S4	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.

1168455_13_ITEM8_P161_S3	At this level of stock holdings the Company can borrow up to $41,000,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P161_S4	To borrow the $98,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,661,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P161_S5	There were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are Connecticut business trusts formed by the Company with capital of $290,000 and $157,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	Under applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust preferred securities that is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to twenty-five percent of the Company's Tier 1 capital, as defined, on a pro forma basis.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P162_S2	At December 31, 2012, all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	During 2002, Plumas Statutory Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities ("Trust Preferred Securities"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	During 2005, Plumas Statutory Trust II issued 4,000 Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $4,000,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S2	The entire proceeds were invested by Trust I in the amount of $6,186,000 and Trust II in the amount of $4,124,000 in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the "Subordinated Debentures") issued by the Company, with identical maturity, repricing and payment terms as the Trust Preferred Securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S3	The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S4	I s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 3.71% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S5	Trust II s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 1.79% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S6	The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable by the Company, subject to receipt by the Company of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on any quarterly anniversary date on or after the 5-year anniversary date of the issuance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S7	The redemption price is par plus accrued and unpaid interest, except in the case of redemption under a special event which is defined in the debenture.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P163_S8	The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption to the extent of any early redemption of the Subordinated Debentures and upon maturity of the Subordinated Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to a cumulative cash distribution on the liquidation amount of $1,000 per security.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P164_S3	Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	The Trust Preferred Securities were sold and issued in private transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P165_S1	The Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the Trust Preferred Securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P165_S2	Since the second quarter of 2010, the Company has deferred regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities and has given notice of deferral each quarterly payment period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	While the Company has accrued for this obligation, it has been deferring the interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as permitted by the agreements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities was $906,000 and $569,000, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S2	On March 15, 2013, with the approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB), the Company made all current and deferred interest payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S3	Interest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to the subordinated debentures was $344,000, $326,000 and $312,000, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S4	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases The Company has commitments for leasing premises under the terms of noncancelable operating leases expiring from 2013 to 2015.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P166_S5	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	Rental expense included in occupancy and equipment expense totaled $153,000, $150,000 and $20,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S3	The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S4	The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P168_S5	The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P169_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P169_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P170_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P170_S2	Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, inventory, equipment, income-producing commercial properties, farm land and residential properties.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S4	At December 31, 2012, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 21% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S5	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 35% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S6	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 44% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S7	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S8	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S9	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S10	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P171_S11	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P172_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company's ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company's assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S3	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank's retained earnings or the Bank's net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DFI, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S4	As of December 31, 2012, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $4,800,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S5	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 11 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S6	As described below, dividends on common stock are also limited related to the Company s participation in the Capital Purchase Program.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S7	Additionally, Plumas Bancorp is required by the FRB to obtain the FRB s prior written consent before paying any dividends on its common stock or its Series A Preferred Stock, or making any payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P173_S8	On March 15, 2013, with the approval of the FRB, the Company made all current and deferred interest payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	Preferred Stock On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Warrant has a 10-year term and is exercisable, with an exercise price, subject to antidilution adjustments, equal to $7.54 per share of the Common Stock.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P175_S1	Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Company allocated the proceeds received on January 30, 2009 between the Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrant based on the estimated relative fair value of each.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P176_S1	The fair value of the Warrant was estimated based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model and totaled $320,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P176_S2	The discount recorded on the Series A Preferred Stock was based on a discount rate of 12% and will be amortized by the level-yield method over 5 years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P176_S3	Discount accretion for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 totaled $87,000, $87,000 and $87,000, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and will pay cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference ($1,000 per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, subject to the Treasury s consultation with the Company s appropriate federal regulator.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	With respect to dividends on the Company s common stock, Treasury s consent shall be required for any increase in common dividends per share until the third anniversary of the date of its investment unless prior to such third anniversary the Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole or the Treasury has transferred all of the Senior Preferred Series A Preferred Stock to third parties.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P177_S3	Furthermore, with respect to dividends on certain other series of preferred stock, restrictions from Treasury may apply.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company does not have any outstanding preferred stock other than the Series A Preferred Stock discussed above.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, Plumas Bancorp, as required by the FRB, suspended the declaration and payment of future quarterly cash dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	Plumas Bancorp is in arrears in the amount of $1,643,000 and $1,046,000 with the dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P180_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P180_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	When a net loss occurs, no difference in earnings per share is calculated because the conversion of potential common stock is anti-dilutive.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	Stock options not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 394,000, 483,000 and 312,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	Stock Options In 2001, the Company established a Stock Option Plan for which 419,806 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash or with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S3	The Plan does not provide for the settlement of awards in cash and new shares are issued upon option exercise.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S4	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S5	Upon grant, options vest ratably over a three to five year period.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P183_S6	A summary of the activity within the Plan follows:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	As of December 31, 2012, there was $88,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P184_S2	The total fair value of options vested was $89,000 and $153,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	Regulatory Capital The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P185_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S3	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S4	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P186_S5	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	OTHER EXPENSES Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P191_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P191_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	As part of its analysis, the Company considered the following positive evidence:
1168455_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company has a long history of earnings and profitability.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company has been profitable for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	Additionally, the Company is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	The volume of potential problem loans in the Company s loan portfolio has significantly decreased.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Company does not have a history of net operating losses carry forwards or tax credits expiring unused.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	At December 31, 2012 total deferred tax assets were approximately $6,883,000 and total deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1,449,000 for a net deferred tax asset of $5,434,000.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P196_S2	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carry-forwards and timing differences in the tax deductibility of the provision for loan losses, impairment charges on other real estate owned and deferred compensation.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P196_S3	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is "more likely than not" that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_13_ITEM8_P198_S5	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.

1168455_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	These include cashier s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers, on-line banking, remote deposit, mobile banking and other customary banking services.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P14_S4	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P14_S5	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage .
1168455_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	The balance in this product at December 31, 2013 was $9.1 million.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn commercial lending office, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P18_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	We offer various loan products which promote home ownership and affordable housing, encourage job growth and support community economic development.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, and government-guaranteed community infrastructure loans.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P19_S5	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Capital Purchase Program - TARP - Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Bancorp s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Bancorp sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	The Bancorp successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S6	On June 27, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S7	On October 25, 2013, Plumas Bancorp repurchased the remaining 3,133 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from a third party private investor for $3,101,670 plus accrued dividends of $30,453.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S8	This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P22_S9	On May 22, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the Trust I ).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Debentures and trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly based on the floating rate described above on the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per security.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Company has entered into contractual agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee payment of: (1) accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the capital securities; (2) the redemption price with respect to any capital securities called for redemption by either Trust I or Trust II, and (3) payments due upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up, or liquidation of either Trust I or Trust II.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	At the request of the FRB, Plumas Bancorp deferred its regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its two trust preferred securities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2012 the amount of the arrearage on the payments on the subordinated debt associated with the trust preferred securities was $906,000 representing eleven quarterly payments.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	On March 15, 2013, with the approval of the FRB, the Company made all current and deferred interest payments on its trust preferred securities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued $7.5 million in subordinated debentures ( subordinated debt ).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender ) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	The subordinated debt agreement provides that in the event of default with respect to the subordinated debt, the Bancorp will be subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions to shareholders, repurchase or redemption of the Bancorp s securities and payment on certain debts or guarantees.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	The subordinated debenture agreement also provides that in the event of default, Lender will have the right to appoint a director to the Bancorp s board of directors and/or the Plumas Bank board in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant ) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Under current capital guidelines the subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital subject to a 20% reduction per year beginning in 2017 and which accumulates by 20% per year through maturity in 2021.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $541,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Company allocated the proceeds received on April 15, 2013 between the subordinated debt and the Lender Warrant based on the estimated relative fair value of each.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	The fair value of the Warrant was estimated based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model and totaled $318,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	The discount recorded on the subordinated note will be amortized by the level-yield method over 2 years.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	Proceeds from the Note and the subordinated debt were used to partially fund the repurchase of preferred stock.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note (the Note ) payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S. Prime Rate plus three-quarters percent per annum, has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Interest expense related to this note for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $23,000.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Effective February 8, 2012, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) which, among other things, requested that the Bank maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	The FDIC and DFI terminated the informal agreement effective January 24, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB Agreement ).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement required prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition, the FRB Agreement required Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	The Company submitted the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P37_S5	On April 19, 2013 the Company received notice that the FRB Agreement had been terminated.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Banks assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	However, at December 31, 2013 approximately 76% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P38_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Currently, within the Bank s branch service area there are 61 banking branch offices of competing institutions, including 28 branches of 8 major banks.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	As of June 30, 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 66%, Quincy 57%, Alturas 66%, Fall River Mills 37%, Kings Beach 30%, Susanville 24%,Truckee 15%, Tahoe City 8%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville and Portola.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Redding is the location of our most recently opened branch, which became operational in June 2007.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company and its subsidiary employed 159 persons.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 137 persons.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including Plumas Bancorp s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	This Code of Ethics Policy is available on Plumas Bancorp s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P49_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, the Company is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	As a bank holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	The FRB expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Federal and State Bank Regulation .
1168455_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Bank, as a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO), the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	The DBO regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	As of the most recent CRA examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	W. The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	We believe that the Bank is in compliance with these standards.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Substantially all deposits with the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system to set quarterly insurance premium assessments which categorizes banks into four risk categories based on capital levels and supervisory CAMELS ratings and names them Risk Categories I, II, III and IV.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	The CAMELS rating system is based upon an evaluation of the six critical elements of an institution s operations: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to risk.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	This rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and operational factors financial institution examiners assess in their evaluation of an institution s performance.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	The following table sets forth these four Risk Categories:
1168455_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	IV Within Risk Category I, the assessment system combines supervisory ratings with other risk measures to differentiate risk.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	For most institutions, the assessment system combines CAMELS component ratings with financial ratios to determine an institution s assessment rate.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	The base assessment rates as of April 1, 2011 (which are still in effect as of December 31, 2013) are as follows (expressed in terms of cents per $100 in insured deposits):
1168455_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	* Initial base rates that were not the minimum or maximum rates will vary between these rates.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	After applying all possible adjustments, minimum and maximum total base assessment rates for each Risk Category are as follows:
1168455_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	* Total base assessment rates do not include the depository institution debt adjustment.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	The unsecured debt adjustment cannot exceed the lesser of 5 basis points or 50% of an insured depository institution s initial base assessment rate.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to take such steps as necessary to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	In setting the assessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments so that assessments will be based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC on a semi-annual or more frequent basis will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	Further increases in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending upon the amount of the increase.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also permanently raised the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified deposit account.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the Bank s liquidity position would likely be affected by deposit withdrawal activity.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Bank also is required to make payments for the servicing of obligations of the Financing Corporation ( FICO ) issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	The FICO annual assessment rate as of first quarter 2013 was 0.64 cents per $100 of deposits and as of first quarter 2014 was 0.62 cents per $100 of deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P75_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P75_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Since December 31, 1992, the FRB and the FDIC have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 8%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 4%.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S4	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P76_S5	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FRB and/or DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	As discussed above, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital, as is the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and Bancorp as of December 31, 2013 follow: Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all of the above capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	The Company could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these regulatory capital guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	Banks with capital ratios below the required minimums are subject to certain administrative actions, including prompt corrective action, the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	On July 2, 2013, the FRB approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S3	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S4	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S5	On July 9, 2013, the FDIC also approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banks, following the actions of the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S6	The FDIC s rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S7	The phase-in period for the final rules will begin for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P82_S8	Management believes that as of December 31, 2013, the Company s capital levels would remain well-capitalized under the new rules.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	As a result of Dodd Frank, Regulation Z promulgated under TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Fair Housing Act (FH Act) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S3	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S4	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P90_S5	Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with CRA, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, HMDA, RFPA and RESPA generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	Federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time, and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), signed into law in July, 2010, significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act created a new interagency council, the Financial System Oversight Council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the U.S. economy posed by systemically significant, large financial companies, including bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act additionally created a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Among the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are the following: Deposit Insurance The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Interstate Branching The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Limits on Derivatives The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits state-chartered banks from engaging in derivatives transactions unless the loans to one borrower limits of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration credit exposure to derivatives transactions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	For this purpose, derivative transactions include any contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based in whole or in part on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of affiliate for purposes of quantitative and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or its affiliates.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act applies Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by disinterested directors.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	The FRB has established standards for reasonable and proportional fees which take into account the costs of preventing fraud.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer (EFT) systems.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	The EFTA is implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer s account.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P108_S3	Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer s account for paying such overdrafts.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	The rule provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	The rule also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer s account on the consumer s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P109_S2	For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	On June 21, 2010, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on incentive compensation which applies to all banks.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	Except for the largest banking organizations, enforcement of this guidance is handled through the supervisors regular risk-focused examination process.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	The employees covered by the final guidance are senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of the organization s firm-wide activities or material business lines; individual employees, including non-executive employees, whose activities may expose the organization to material amounts of risk; and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who, in the aggregate, may expose the organization to material amounts of risk, even if no individual employee is likely to expose the organization to material risk.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P110_S3	The guidance provides for three principles for safe and sound incentive compensation arrangements:
1168455_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	Strong Corporate Governance: Banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	In May 2009 the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	This law permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P112_S2	In implementing the law, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to (1) provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) make mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P112_S3	The new law also authorizes the Secretary of HUD to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P112_S4	The law also amended the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	Also in May 2009, the Credit Card Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P113_S1	This law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions, such as when a promotional rate ends, there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P113_S2	Interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P113_S3	Significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P113_S4	The law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers (such as utility companies and other creditors) for existing credit card balances, though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least 45 days advance notice of the change.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	The law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P114_S1	Opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P114_S2	They have at least five years to pay the balance.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P114_S3	Credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under 21, unless they have adult co-signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	The law requires card issuers to give card account holders a reasonable amount of time to make payments on monthly bills.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	That means payments would be due at least 21 days after they are mailed or delivered.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P115_S2	Credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	When consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P116_S1	Consumers must opt in to over-limit fees.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P116_S2	Those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P116_S3	Fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P116_S4	Finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	Fees on credit cards cannot exceed 25 percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling US economy.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S1	ARRA authorizes spending of $787 billion, including about $288 billion for tax relief, $144 billion for state and local relief aid, and $111 billion for infrastructure and science.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S2	In addition, ARRA includes additional executive compensation restrictions for recipients of funds from the US Treasury under the Troubled Assets Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (EESA).
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S3	EESA was amended by ARRA to provide additional incentive compensation restrictions for financial institutions receiving TARP funds and also require additional corporate governance provisions with respect to limiting golden parachutes, lavish expenditures and requiring officer certifications of compliance and clawbacks for improperly earned incentive compensation at such institutions.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S4	In addition, EESA as amended by ARRA provides that for any TARP recipient, its annual meeting materials shall include a nonbinding shareholder approval proposal of executive compensation for shareholders to vote.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P118_S5	ARRA also provides $730 million to the SBA and makes changes to the agency s lending and investment programs so that they can reach more small businesses that need help.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	$375 million for temporarily eliminating fees on SBA-backed loans and raising SBA s guarantee percentage on some loans to 90 percent.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	$255 million for a new loan program to help small businesses meet existing debt payments.

1168455_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	While some substantive changes were included in this legislation due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank federal legislation and some technical corrections that resulted from earlier amendments to the Code, the majority of the work involved in SB 664 was to reorder the section numbering in the Code.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P122_S2	Among other things, the law requires a bank that establishes a branch office in this state in accordance with the National Bank Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to provide a specified notice to the Commissioner of DBO within 10 days of the establishment, relocation, or redesignation of offices.

1168455_14_ITEM1_P123_S1	In 2011, the benefits of SB 931 was extended to such borrowers with a second or subordinate lien in SB458 where such lien holder agreed to the short sale.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	In California, the enactment of AB329 in 2009, the Reverse Mortgage Elder Protection Act of 2009 prohibits a lender or any other person who participates in the origination of the mortgage from participation in, being associated with, or employing any party that participates in or is associated with any other financial or insurance activity or referring a prospective borrower to anyone for the purchase of other financial or insurance products; and imposes certain disclosure requirements on the lender.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	The enactment of AB1160 in 2009, requires a supervised financial institution in California that negotiates primarily in any of a number of specified languages in the course of entering into a contract or agreement for a loan or extension of credit secured by residential real property, to deliver, prior to the execution of the contract or agreement, and no later than 3 business days after receiving the written application, a specified form in that language summarizing the terms of the contract or agreement; provides for administrative penalties for violations; and requires the California Department of Corporations and the DBO to create a form for providing translations and make it available in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P124_S2	The enactment of AB 1291 in 2009 made changes to the California Unclaimed Property Law including (among other things): allowing electronic notification to customers who have consented to electronic notice; requiring that notices contain certain information and allow the holder to provide electronic means to enable the owner to contact the holder in lieu of returning the prescribed form to declare the owner s intent; authorizing the holder to give additional notices; and requiring, beginning January 1, 2011, a banking or financial organization to provide a written notice regarding escheat at the time a new account or safe deposit box is opened.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	On February 20, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger signed ABX2 7 and SBX2 7, which established the California Foreclosure Prevention Act.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	The California Foreclosure Prevention Act modifies the foreclosure process to provide additional time for borrowers to work out loan modifications while providing an exemption for mortgage loan servicers that have implemented a comprehensive loan modification program.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P125_S2	Civil Code Section 2923.52 requires an additional 90 day period beyond the period already provided before a Notice of Sale can be given in order to allow all parties to pursue a loan modification to prevent foreclosure of loans meeting certain criteria identified in that section.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	A mortgage loan servicer who has implemented a comprehensive loan modification program may file an application for exemption from the provisions of Civil Code Section 2923.52.
1168455_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	Approval of this application provides the mortgage loan servicer an exemption from the additional 90-day period before filing the Notice of Sale when foreclosing on real property covered by the law.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	General We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Overview The Company recorded net income of $3.43 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a 76% increase over net income of $1.95 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Pretax income increased by $2.6 million, or 85%, from $3.0 million in 2012 to $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Net interest income increased by $775 thousand from $17.2 million during 2012 to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.0 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $260 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	Interest on loans increased by $747 thousand and interest on investment securities increased by $270 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	A decrease of $247 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowings of $507 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S6	The provision for loan losses declined by $950 thousand from $2.35 million during 2012 to $1.40 million during 2013 resulting in an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $1.7 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2013 non-interest income totaled $6.6 million an increase of $46 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S8	A decrease of $403 thousand in gain on sale of securities was offset by increases in core non-interest income including $295 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, $75 thousand in gain on sale of loans and $108 thousand in loan servicing income.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S9	We continue to achieve savings in non-interest expense resulting in a reduction in non-interest expense of $807 thousand from $18.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 to $17.6 million during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P11_S10	Reductions of $239 thousand in salary and benefits expense, $149 thousand in occupancy and equipment, $44 thousand in professional fees, $421 thousand in the provision for changes in OREO, $178 thousand in FDIC insurance, $187 thousand in loss on sale of OREO and $53 thousand in postage were partially offset by increases in other expenses the largest of which were outside service fees of $352 thousand and costs associated with OREO properties of $123 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The provision for income taxes increased from $1.1 million in 2012 to $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Net income allocable to common shareholders increased by $2.38 million from $1.27 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 to $3.65 million during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income allocable to common shareholders is calculated by adding discount on redemption of preferred stock and subtracting dividends and discount amortized on preferred stock from net income.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	During 2013 the Company redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock, recording a $565 discount on redemption.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Related to this redemption, dividends and discount amortized on the preferred stock declined by $337 thousand from $684 thousand during 2012 to $347 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Total assets at December 31, 2013 were $516 million, an increase of $37.9 million from $478 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Increases included $5.2 million in cash, $9.4 million in investments, $24.1 million in net loans and $1.1 million in OREO.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	Total deposits increased by $37.9 million from $411 million at December 31, 2012 to $449 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S6	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2013 as evidenced by increases of $19.2 million in demand deposits and $27.3 million in savings and money market accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S7	Time deposits declined by $7.9 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P13_S8	Interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) declined by $0.7 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Shareholders equity decreased by $11.2 million from $41.8 million at December 31, 2012 to $30.6 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	This decrease resulted from the redemption of the preferred stock, payment of preferred stock dividends and an increase in other comprehensive loss.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	These items were partially offset by earnings during the year, a $565 discount on redemption of the preferred stock and an increase in common stock totaling $156 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	The return on average assets was 0.69% for 2013, up from 0.42% for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	The return on average common equity was 12.0% for 2013, up from 4.3% for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders equity.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	(1) Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	(4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	(5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, up $775 thousand, or 4.5%, from $17.2 million for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	An increase of $1.0 million, or 5.6% in interest income, from $18.4 million during 2012 to $19.4 million during the current year, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $260 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Interest and fees on loans increased by $747 thousand, interest on investment securities increased by $270 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $18 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S6	Interest and fees on loans was $18.2 million during 2013 and $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S7	The average loan balances were $321.2 million for 2013, up $19.4 million from the $301.8 million for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S8	The largest areas of loan growth were in our commercial real estate and auto portfolios.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P24_S9	We have dedicated significant resources to our loan production activities and have emphasized the need for quality and diversified growth in the portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table compares loan balances by type at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The average yields on loans were 5.66% for 2013 down from 5.77% for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to intense pricing competition in our service area.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $270 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 12 basis points from 1.28% during 2012 to 1.40% during 2013 and an increase in average balance from $69.7 million in 2012 to $82.8 million in 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in yield incudes an increase in government sponsored agency residential mortgage backed securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest income on interest-bearing deposits, which totaled $124 thousand in 2013 and $106 thousand in 2012, mostly relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $247 thousand, or 29%, to $600 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, down from $847 thousand in 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Interest expense on time deposits declined by $232 thousand from $513 thousand at December 31, 2012 to $281 thousand at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	Average time deposits declined by $10.1 million from $76.1 million during 2012 to $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.67% during 2012 to 0.43% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S6	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of higher rate time deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S7	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $21 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S8	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 2 basis points from 0.13% during 2012 to 0.11% during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S9	Average balances increased by $1.3 million from 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S10	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $9 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 4 basis points from 0.21% during 2012 to 0.17% during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S11	Average money market balances increased by $5.8 million from $42.9 million during 2012 to $48.7 million in 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S12	Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $15 thousand as we have experienced strong growth in this category of deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S13	Average savings deposits increased by $15.7 million from $68.8 million during 2012 to $84.5 million during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S14	The average rate paid on savings accounts during this same period declined from 19 basis points during 2012 to 17 basis points during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S15	The decline in rates paid on deposits is consistent with a decline in competitive market rates in our service area.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S16	Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $507 thousand from $427 thousand during the twelve months ending December 31, 2012 to $934 thousand during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S17	This increase was related to $541 thousand in interest expense on a $7.5 million subordinated debenture which was issued to help fund the repurchase of preferred stock.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S18	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant ) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P28_S19	The effective yield on the debenture was 10.4% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note dated October 24, 2013 payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S. Prime Rate plus three-quarters percent per annum (currently 4%), has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Proceeds from this note were used to help fund the redemption of the remaining preferred shares.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	Interest expense on this note for 2013 totaled $23 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which decreased by $31 thousand from 2012, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	In addition, as a result of deferring our interest payments under the debentures during the 2012 period we were required to pay interest on the deferred interest payments.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	This had the effect of increasing interest expense and effective yield on the debentures.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	The deferred interest on the debentures was repaid in March of 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest on other borrowings, which totaled $57 thousand in 2013 and $83 thousand in 2012, primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2013 decreased 15 basis points to 4.03%, from 4.18% for 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, up $331 thousand, or 2%, from $16.8 million for 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	A decrease of $243 thousand, or 1.3% in interest income, from $18.7 million during 2011 to $18.4 million during the current year, was offset by a decline in interest expense of $574 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	Interest and fees on loans increased by $27 thousand; however, this was offset by a $252 thousand decline in interest on investment securities and an $18 thousand decline in interest on deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in yield partially offset by a decrease in average loan balances.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	Interest on investments securities declined related to a decrease in yield partially offset by an increase in average balance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S7	Interest and fees on loans was $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S8	The average loan balances were $301.8 million for 2012, down $1.0 million from the $302.8 million for 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S9	This decline in loans was mostly related to normal pay downs and prepayments, loan charge-offs and real estate acquired through foreclosure mostly offset by growth in our auto loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S10	The average yields on loans were 5.77% for 2012 up from 5.75% for 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S11	As a result of a decrease in yield of 64 basis points from 1.92% during 2011 to 1.28% during 2012, interest on investment securities decreased by $252 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S12	The effect of the decrease in yield on interest income was partially offset by an increase in average investment securities of $10.2 million from $59.4 million during 2011 to $69.6 million during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P32_S13	The decline in yield is primarily related to the replacement of matured and sold investment securities with new investments with market yields below those which they replaced.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest income on interest-bearing deposits, which totaled $106 thousand in 2012 and $124 thousand in 2011, mostly relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $622 thousand, or 42%, to $847 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, down from $1.5 million in 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	This decrease primarily relates to decreases in the average balance and rate paid on time and interest bearing demand deposits and a decline in the rate paid on money market accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Interest on time deposits declined by $548 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	Average time deposits declined by $20.9 million from $97.0 million during 2011 to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S5	The decrease in average time deposits is mostly related to a promotional time deposit product we began offering in June, 2009 and continued to offer until April 30, 2010.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S6	During 2011 the average balance of promotional deposits was $21.8 million; these promotional time deposits had all matured by December 31, 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S7	The average rate paid on promotional deposits during 2011 was 2%.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S8	In addition, the Bank has held down the rate paid on time deposits in 2012 as it has excess liquidity and does not need to pay for deposits at above market rates.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S9	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 1.09% during 2011 to 0.67% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S10	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of the higher rate promotional deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S11	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $76 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S12	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 7 basis points from 0.20% during 2011 to 0.13% during 2012, mostly related to a decline in market rates in the Company s service area.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S13	Average balances declined by $11.3 million from 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S14	During 2011 we significantly lowered the rate paid on local public agencies NOW accounts as we determined that the previous rate did not meet our profitability targets, as a result some of these deposits moved out of the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S15	During 2012 average public NOW accounts declined by $7.4 million from $24.3 million during 2011 to $16.9 million during the year ended December 21, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S16	At December 31, 2012 balances in this account type were $11.8 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S17	We do not expect significant additional declines in public NOW balances during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S18	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $24 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 8 basis points from 0.29% during 2011 to 0.21% during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S19	This was primarily related to a money market sweep product we offered in 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S20	We no longer offer the money market sweep account having replaced it with a product that utilizes repurchase agreements during the third quarter of 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P33_S21	Average money market balances increased by $2.9 million from $40.0 million during 2011 to $42.9 million in 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $18 thousand from 2011, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest on other borrowings primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2012 increased 10 basis points to 4.18%, from 4.08% for 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Provision for Loan Losses During the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.4 million, down $950 thousand from the $2.3 million provision recorded during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 non-interest income totaled $6.6 million an increase of $46 thousand from 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The largest component of this change was an increase of $295 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts which we attribute to growth in the Company s demand deposit accounts, an increase in debit card interchange income and a restructuring of our service charge fee schedule beginning in August of 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Gains on sale of government guaranteed loans increased by $75 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	During 2012 we sold 53 loans receiving proceeds of $20.1 million on sale.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	Sales proceeds increased to $21.7 million in 2013 related to the sale of 55 loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Loan servicing income is fees we generate on servicing previously sold portions of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	This amount is recorded net of the amortization of the servicing fee asset recorded at the time the loans are sold.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	During 2013 loan servicing income totaled $323 thousand an increase of $108 thousand from $215 thousand during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Income from this source will continue to grow as long as loans sold exceed loan principal payments in our serving portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	Customer service fees increased by $41 thousand much of which we attribute to the August 2013 change in service fee schedule.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The largest decrease in non-interest income was $403 thousand in gain on sale of investment securities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	No investment securities were sold in 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	During 2012 we sold twenty-five available-for-sale securities totaling $20.8 million recognizing a gain on sale of $403 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Other non-interest income declined by $73 thousand as during the 2012 period this item was abnormally high related to a $99 thousand adjustment to accrued life insurance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 non-interest income decreased by $566 thousand to $6.6 million from $7.2 million during 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $615 thousand in gains on the sale of government guaranteed loans from $1.9 million during 2011 to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, related to a change in SBA requirements, guaranteed portions of SBA loans were no longer required to be sold with a 90 day premium recourse requirement.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	This resulted in recording gains on sales of loans during 2011 representing both loans sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and loans sold during the fourth quarter of 2010.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, gain on sale of loans during 2011benefited from a government program temporarily increasing the government guarantee in order to stimulate small business lending.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	The remaining decrease in non-interest income was related to a decline in gains on sale of investment securities from $666 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $403 thousand during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	During the 2011 period proceeds of $29.4 million were generated on the sale of twenty-seven securities and during the 2012 proceeds of $20.8 million were received on the sale of twenty-five securities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $140 thousand primarily related to an increase in use of overdraft protection services.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2011 we introduced a new overdraft protection (ODP) program which we made available to a larger portion of our customer base than the prior program, resulting in an increase in service fee income.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S7	This new program has enabled us to increase income while strengthening our regulatory compliance over the ODP function.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S8	The increase in other non-interest income mostly relates to a $99 thousand adjustment to accrued life insurance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P43_S9	The following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	We continue to achieve savings in many areas of non-interest expense resulting in a reduction in non-interest expense of $807 thousand from $18.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 to $17.6 million during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Reductions of $239 thousand in salary and benefits expense, $421 thousand in the provision for changes in OREO, $187 thousand in gain/loss on sale of OREO, $149 thousand in occupancy and equipment, $44 thousand in professional fees, $178 thousand in FDIC insurance and $53 thousand in postage were partially offset by increases in other expenses, the largest of which were outside service fees of $352 thousand and costs associated with OREO properties of $123 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	During June of 2012 we outsourced the processing of our account statements and notices and during June of 2013 we outsourced our item processing department resulting in savings in salary expense, occupancy and equipment costs, postage and stationary costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	The $178 thousand reduction in FDIC insurance expense is related to a decline in the rate charged to Plumas Bank by the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The reduction in professional fees primarily relates to a decrease in consulting costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $239 thousand primarily related to declines in salary continuation expense and stock compensation expense and an increase in deferred loan origination costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	Salary continuation expense declined by $188 thousand related to an adjustment in 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S7	During 2012, related to a significant reduction in long term market interest rates, we reduced the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our salary continuation liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S8	This had the effect of increasing salary continuation expense during 2012 by $195 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S9	Stock compensation expense decreased by $58 thousand from $93 thousand during 2012 to $35 thousand during the current period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S10	During the first quarter of 2012 we had an adjustment to the estimated forfeiture rate resulting in an increase in stock compensation; no adjustment was required during 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S11	The largest reduction in salary and benefits was related to an increase in deferred loan origination costs totaling $384 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S12	We attribute this increase in deferred loan origination costs to an increase in lending activity.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P44_S13	These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense of $250 thousand and salary expense of $173 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Bank s bonus plan for 2013 provides for a bonus pool of 50% of the amount that pretax income exceeds budgeted pretax income with a cap of $250 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The maximum amount was allocated under this formula.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	There was no bonus plan in place and no bonuses were earned or paid in 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Salary expense increased by $173 thousand as savings related to the outsourcing of statement and item processing were offset by an increase in loan production personnel and salary increases.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	The allowance is established through a provision for subsequent losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from impairment are recorded in other income or expensed as incurred.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The $486 thousand OREO provision during 2013, a $421 thousand decline from 2012, resulted from declines in value of ten properties.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The $907 thousand in OREO provision during the 2012 was related to a decline in the value of twenty-one properties.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold twenty-eight properties and a portion of another property recording a gain on sale of $171 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	During 2012, we sold fourteen properties and a portion of two other properties recording a loss on sale of $16 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	The increase in outside service fees was related to the outsourcing of our statement and notice processing in June of 2012, the outsourcing of our item processing beginning in June of 2013, an increase in costs related to monitoring and maintaining our ATMs and an increase in the cost of managing our investment portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	During 2012 the Bank modernized its ATM network by purchasing new ATM machines which have the ability to accept currency and checks and provide an imaged receipt.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	While these ATMs provide a significant increase in functionality, they are also more expensive to operate and maintain.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	During the first half of 2012 we began to use a third party for assistance with the analysis and management of our investment securities portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in cost during 2013 for this function was related to a full year of costs and an increase in the balance of our portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	OREO expense during the 2012 period benefited from $80 thousand in rental income net of operating expenses on an apartment building acquired in July 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Both the rental income and the operating expenses are included under the category of OREO expense.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	This building was sold during the third quarter of 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	The remaining increase in OREO expense during 2013 primarily relates to an increase in legal expense as we are actively pursuing additional recoveries on selected OREO properties through legal channels.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	During 2012 we achieved savings in many categories of non-interest expense resulting in a reduction in non-interest expense of $869 thousand from $19.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $18.4 million during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Significant reductions in salary and benefits expense, FDIC insurance, loss on sale of OREO, OREO expense, and postage were partially offset by an increase in the provision for changes in valuation of OREO of $328 thousand, an increase in outside service fees of $233 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $145 thousand and an increase in insurance expense of $78 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $227 thousand related to a decline of $80 thousand in commission expense, $88 thousand in medical and dental insurance expense (group insurance), $50 thousand in workers compensation expense and an increase of $247 thousand in deferred loan origination costs partially offset by an increase of $92 thousand in salary continuation expense and $131 thousand in stock compensation expense.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Commission expense, which relates to government-guaranteed lending personnel, decreased by $80 thousand consistent with the decline in government-guaranteed loan sales during the comparison periods.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	The decrease in group insurance was mostly related to a decline in employees enrolled in the insurance plans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S5	The decrease in workers compensation was related to changing providers.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S6	Previously we were members of a small group plan and our premiums were adversely affected by claims within the group.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P50_S7	We have exited this plan and have seen a considerable reduction in workers compensation premiums.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Related to an increase in lending activity, the deferral of loan origination costs increased by $247 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	During 2012, related to a significant reduction in long term market interest rates, we reduced the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our salary continuation liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	This had the effect of increasing salary continuation expense by $195 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	Absent this adjustment salary continuation expense would have declined by $103 thousand, as salary continuation expense during 2011 included a one-time adjustment to reflect the early retirement of the Company s Chief Credit officer.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Employee stock compensation expense increased by $131 thousand from a credit of $38 thousand during 2011 to expense of $93 thousand during the current period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	The credit in stock compensation expense during the 2011 period was related to a revision in the estimated forfeiture rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S6	A decline of $486 thousand in FDIC insurance expense relates to a decline in the rate charged Plumas Bank by the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S7	This decline in rate includes a change in the assessment base and assessment rate under new rules enacted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P51_S8	These new rules changed the assessment base from total deposits to average total assets less tangible capital, but also significantly lowered the assessment rates, causing a net favorable impact on our FDIC insurance premiums.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Loss on sale of OREO totaled $16 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $590 thousand from the $606 thousand incurred in 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	In the second quarter of 2011 the Bank sold its largest OREO holding which represented approximately half of its OREO holdings at that time.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	The Bank incurred a $617 thousand loss on sale of this large OREO holding in 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	OREO expense declined by $235 thousand from $422 thousand during 2011 to $187 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	OREO expense benefited from a decline in OREO balances in 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S5	In addition, 2011 OREO expense was adversely affected by significant cleanup costs on one property and considerable legal costs related to another property.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S6	Both of these properties where sold during 2011.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S7	Postage declined by $86 thousand related to the outsourcing of our statement processing activities during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P52_S8	Effective with the outsourcing, the cost of mailing statements, notices and similar documents is included in outside service costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The $907 thousand in OREO provision, an increase of $328 thousand from $579 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, was related to a decline in the value of twenty-one properties based on appraisals received during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Of these twenty-one properties, seven have been sold and the remaining fourteen represent 61% of the Bank s OREO balance as of December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The largest component of the $233 thousand increase in outside service costs was $112 thousand in costs related to the outsourcing of our statement processing operations in June, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company anticipates meaningful savings, related to the statement outsourcing.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	During 2012 the Bank modernized its ATM network by purchasing new ATM machines which have the ability to accept currency and checks and provide an imaged receipt.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	A large portion of the remaining increase in outside service costs relates to maintaining these advanced machines which are considerably more complicated than our previous ATMs many of which were over ten years old.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	The $145 thousand increase in professional fees mostly relates to an increase in consulting costs in the Company s data processing and network administration functions.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S5	Insurance expense was abnormally low during 2011 as it included the reversal of the accrual for split dollar life insurance for the Bank s former Chief Credit Officer who forfeited his right to this insurance when he left the Bank prior to reaching the age of sixty-five.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S6	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $2.2 million, or 38.7% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S7	During 2012 the Company recorded an income tax provision of $1.1 million, or 35.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P54_S8	The percentages for 2013 and 2012 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance, municipal loan interest, and in the state of California enterprise zone interest decrease taxable income.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net loans increased by $24.1 million, or 8%, from $310.3 million at December 31, 2012 to $334.4 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in loan balances during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013 mostly relates to growth in the Company s automobile and commercial real estate loan portfolios.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	These commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P57_S5	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	As shown in the following table the Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and residential real estate loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Construction and land development loans represented 5.3% and 5.0% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 6% during the last two years reflects management s continued efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 76% and 78% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P59_S5	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, approximately 73% of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	At December 31, 2013, 40% of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $31 million at December 31, 2013 and $35 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	(2) Includes agriculture real estate The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates: Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Board s Loan Committee reviews the asset quality of new loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	It consists of members of executive management and credit administration management, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Effective for the third quarter of 2012, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	This modification incorporated historical losses from the beginning of the latest business cycle.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Previously we utilized historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	This modification had the effect of increasing the required allowance by approximately $250,000 for 2012 related to the expanded historical loss period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	The Company believes that, given the recent trend in historical losses, it was prudent to increase the period examined and that a full business cycle was the appropriate period.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.4 million down $950 thousand from the $2.4 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 down $2 million from $3.6 million during 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 1.18% during 2012 to 0.49% during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses: The allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million at December 31, 2013 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased from $1.2 million at December 31, 2012 to $629 thousand at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S6	General reserves increased by $388 thousand to $4.9 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S7	Related to the decline in specific reserves, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.80% at December 31, 2012 to 1.63% at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P76_S8	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans decreased slightly from 1.52% at December 31, 2012 to 1.49% at December 31, 2013 primarily related to improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio including reductions in historical net charge-offs and declines in the volume of classified loan balances.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled $7.6 million, $9.3 million, $8.4 million, $2.0 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 6 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2013 were $5.5 million, a decrease of $8.2 million from the $13.7 million balance at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	The decline of $8.2 million includes $3.8 million in loans transferred to OREO, charge-offs and principal repayments on nonperforming loans partially offset by $2.0 million in additional loans placed on nonperforming status.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	Principal repayments on nonperforming loans include payments from the SBA related to $2.4 million in guaranteed portions of loans on nonaccrual at December 31 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Included in the $3.8 million in loans transferred to OREO was a land development loan with a principal balance of $3.0 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S5	During 2013 a $0.7 million charge-off was recorded on this loan while the remaining balance of $2.3 million was transferred to OREO.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S6	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $578 thousand at December 31, 2013 and $976 thousand at December 31, 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P84_S7	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days decreased from $2.8 million at December 31, 2012 to $1.5 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $11.1 million from $18.6 million at December 31, 2012 to $7.5 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased as well from $6.7 million at December 31, 2012 to $5.8 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	At December 31, 2013, $2.9 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $9.8 million and $18.8 million, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $629 thousand and $1.2 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P85_S7	Additionally, $0.7 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2013 and $3.0 million at December 31 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the probable incurred losses in the portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2013 is appropriate.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	Repossessed assets and OREO are carried at fair market value, less selling costs.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	OREO holdings represented twenty-six properties totaling $6.4 million at December 31, 2013 and forty properties totaling $5.3 million at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S4	The largest property in OREO is a land development property with an OREO value of $2.3 million representing 36% of the total OREO balance.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S5	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 2.33% at December 31, 2013 and 3.98% at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S6	The following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, dollars in thousands: Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S7	Total investment securities increased by $9.4 million from $81.0 million as of December 31, 2012 to $90.4 million as of December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S8	Included in the $90.4 million at December 31, 2013 were $89.0 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and six municipal securities totaling $1.4 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S9	At December 31, 2012 the investment portfolio was invested entirely in U.S. Government-sponsored agencies.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S10	The Bank expects to increase its holdings of municipal securities gradually over the next twelve months.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S11	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2013 and 2012; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) totaling $29.1 million at December 31, 2013 and $24.5 million at December 31, 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P87_S12	These balances currently earn 25 basis points.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Gross unrealized losses on investment securities at December 31, 2013 were $2.0 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Management believes the unrealized losses primarily relate to changes in interest rates and other market conditions rather than deterioration in credit quality.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	During 2013 we have experienced strong core deposit growth and have benefited from the closing of two branches of a large national bank in our service area.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Total deposits increased by $37.9 million from $411 million at December 31, 2012 to $449 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The increase in deposits included $19.2 million in demand deposits and $27.3 million in savings and money market accounts.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	Time deposits declined by $7.9 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	Interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) declined by $0.7 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S5	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P94_S6	The following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2013 or 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2013:
1168455_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company s local business and individual customer base.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	The potential impact on the Company s liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company s asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $104,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $193,000,000.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company held $2,226,000 and $1,950,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2013, the Company can borrow up to $47,400,000.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	To borrow the $104,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,660,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	There were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P98_S6	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $11 million and $10 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note (the Note ) payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S. Prime Rate plus three-quarters percent per annum, 4.00% at December 31, 2013, has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	Interest expense related to this note for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $23,000.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Under the Note the Bank is required to maintain specified levels of capital and to meet or exceed certain capital and asset quality ratios.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Bank was in compliance with all such requirements at December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	In 2011 Plumas Bank introduced a new product for their larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	The balance in this product at December 31, 2013 was $9.1 million an increase of $1.7 million from the December 31, 2012 balance of $7.4 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued $7.5 million in subordinated debentures ( subordinated debt ).
1168455_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender ) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Under current capital guidelines the subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $541,000.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	At December 31, 2013, all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	During 2002, Plumas Statutory Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities ( Trust Preferred Securities ), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P107_S11	This decrease resulted from the redemption of the preferred stock, payment of preferred stock dividends and an increase in other comprehensive loss.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P107_S12	These items were partially offset by earnings during the year, a $565 discount on redemption of the preferred stock and an increase in common stock totaling $156 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P107_S13	Preferred stock declined by $11.8 million and during 2013 we paid $2 million in dividends on preferred stock which includes dividends that were deferred during the period from May of 2010 until May of 2013.

1168455_14_ITEM7_P107_S15	The increase in common stock includes $318,000 related to the issuance of a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of stock at $5.25, $34 thousand related to the exercise of stock options representing 11,400 shares and stock based compensation expense of $38,000 partially offset by the repurchase of the outstanding warrant to purchase 237,712 shares of common stock at a cost of $234 thousand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors (the Board).
1168455_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	No common cash dividends were paid during the last five years and none are anticipated to be paid in 2014.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, with risk-based capital ratios calculated separately for the Company and the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	There are two categories of capital under the guidelines: Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders equity, and qualifying trust-preferred securities (including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other deductions, notably the unrealized net gains or losses (after tax adjustments) on available-for-sale investment securities carried at fair market value; Tier 2 capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P113_S3	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	As noted previously, the Company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate $10 million in trust-preferred securities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	These trust-preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed 25% of total Tier 1 capital, but are classified as long-term debt in accordance with GAAP.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust-preferred securities (and/or related subordinated debentures) in the Tier I capital of bank holding companies.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (amounts in thousands except percentage amounts).
1168455_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank currently meet their entire capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized leverage, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of 5%, 6% and 10%, respectively, at all times.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	On July 2, 2013, the FRB approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S3	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S4	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S5	On July 9, 2013, the FDIC also approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banks, following the actions of the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S6	The FDIC s rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by the FRB.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S7	The phase-in period for the final rules will begin for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P118_S8	Management believes that as of December 31, 2013, the Company s capital levels would remain well-capitalized under the new rules.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $84.2 million in unfunded loan commitments and $60 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S3	This compares to $76.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $110 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S4	Of the $84.2 million in unfunded loan commitments, $42.8 million and $41.4 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013, $39.0 million were secured by real estate, of which $12.6 million was secured by commercial real estate and $26.4 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P120_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	The Company leases one depository branch, one lending office and one loan administration office and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $154,000 and $153,000 during the years ended December, 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2015 and the last such lease expiring during 2016.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P122_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P122_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $104,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $193,000,000.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company held $2,226,000 and $1,950,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S3	Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2013, the Company can borrow up to $47,400,000.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S4	To borrow the $104,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2,660,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S5	There were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P123_S6	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $11 million and $10 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Customer deposits are the Company s primary source of funds.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	Total deposits were $449 million as of December 31, 2013, up $37.9 million, or 9%, from the December 31, 2012 balance of $411 million.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P125_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_14_ITEM7_P125_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.
1168455_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	required to provide the information required by this item.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P1_S5	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P1_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	THE BUSINESS OF PLUMAS BANCORP During 2002, Plumas Bancorp (the Company ) was incorporated as a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring Plumas Bank (the Bank ) in a one bank holding company reorganization.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation, expansion and diversification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I ( Trust I ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS On February 15, 2012, the Bank received notice from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) that the Consent Order with the FDIC and the DFI which was effective on March 16, 2011 had been terminated.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Effective February 8, 2012, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requested that the Bank continue to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	The FDIC and DFI terminated the informal agreement effective January 24, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P12_S4	Effective July 1, 2013, the California Department of Corporations and the DFI merged to form the Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB Agreement ).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp agreed to take certain actions that were designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement required prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	On April 19, 2013 the Company received notice that the FRB Agreement had been terminated.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	Plumas Statutory Trust I and Trust II are not consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company s investment in Trust I of $298,000 and Trust II of $159,000 are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances to conform to the classifications used in 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	These reclassifications had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or net change in cash and cash equivalents.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Segment Information Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Use of Estimates To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	Net cash flows are reported for customer loans and deposit transactions and repurchase agreements.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Investment Securities Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P22_S3	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P22_S4	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S3	The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P23_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, FHLB stock totaled $2,226,000 and $1,950,000, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Loans Held for Sale, Loan Sales and Servicing Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the Company had $2,800,000 and $3,367,000, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S4	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S5	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P25_S6	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $70,212,000 and $58,696,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S4	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S5	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P26_S6	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan, the servicing asset, the interest-only (IO) strip, and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	The servicing asset is recognized and amortized over the estimated life of the related loan.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S4	Assets (accounted for as IO strips) are recorded at the fair value of the difference between note rates and rates paid to purchasers (the interest spread) and contractual servicing fees, if applicable.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S5	IO strips are carried at fair value with gains or losses recorded as a component of shareholders equity, similar to available-for-sale investment securities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P28_S6	Significant future prepayments of these loans will result in the recognition of additional amortization of related servicing assets and an adjustment to the carrying value of related IO strips.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Loans Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S4	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S5	The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P33_S6	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Cash received on previously charged-off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 (the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	During 2012, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	This modification incorporated historical losses from the beginning of the latest business cycle.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	Previously we utilized historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S4	This modification had the effect of increasing the required allowance related to the expanded historical loss period by $250,000.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P42_S5	The Company believes that, given the recent trend in historical losses, it was prudent to increase the period examined and that a full business cycle was the appropriate period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans and credit card receivables.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, with the exception of automobile and other loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows: Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P50_S4	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described on the next page.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Commercial Commercial loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than real estate portfolio segments because these loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S4	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S5	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S6	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P54_S7	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer and credit card loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DBO, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P58_S5	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $141,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	Other Real Estate Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $6,399,000 ($9,065,000 less a valuation allowance of $2,666,000) at December 31, 2013 and $5,295,000 ($8,517,000 less a valuation allowance of $3,222,000) at December 31, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $2,404,000, $3,714,000 and $4,937,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2013 the Company recorded a gain on sale of other real estate owned of $171,000.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 the Company recorded a loss on sale of other real estate owned of $16,000 and $606,000, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S6	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S7	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S8	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S9	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are also recorded in other expenses as incurred.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P59_S10	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over ten years.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	These assets were fully amortized as of December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	There were no such events or circumstances in 2013 or 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Income Taxes The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P68_S3	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P68_S4	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S5	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P70_S6	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income plus discount on redemption of preferred stock less preferred dividends and accretion) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	There were no sales of available for sale investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	The amount reclassified out of other accumulated comprehensive income relating to realized gains on securities available for sale was $403,000 and $666,000 for 2012 and 2011, with the related tax effect of $167,000 and $276,000 respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plan, net of related tax (expense)/benefit, recorded in 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $37,000, $93,000 and $(38,000) or $0.01, $0.02 and $(0.01) per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	During 2011 the Company granted options to purchase 248,000 shares of common stock.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to finalize the reporting requirements for reclassifications of amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	Items reclassified out of AOCI to net income in their entirety must have the effect of the reclassification disclosed according to the respective income statement line item.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	This information must be provided either on the face of the financial statements by income statement line item, or in a footnote.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P80_S3	For public companies, the amendments in the update became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P80_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the impact of this update on the Company s disclosures was minimal as the only changes to AOCI were changes in market values related to available for sale securities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	Current GAAP does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	The adoption of ASU 2013-11 will require an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, unless an exception applies.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P81_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the provisions of ASU 2013-11 will have on its financial statements.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P83_S3	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 are as follows:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2).
1168455_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The fair value of the Company s Note Payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Subordinated debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value: Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2013 are summarized below:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 are summarized below: The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2013 or 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2013 are summarized below:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2012 are summarized below: The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or loans that have been subject to partial charge-offs are generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P108_S2	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P108_S3	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	Total losses of $24,000 and $2,044,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S2	These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S3	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S4	Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S5	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P110_S6	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

1168455_14_ITEM8_P116_S1	All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	When analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the historical and implied volatility of the security; the financial condition of the issuer of the security; and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P117_S1	As of December 31, 2013, management does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S3	The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S4	The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P158_S5	The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P159_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P160_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P160_S2	Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, inventory, equipment, income-producing commercial properties, farm land and residential properties.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S4	At December 31, 2013, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 18% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S5	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 36% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S6	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 46% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S7	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S8	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S9	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S10	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P161_S11	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	Contingencies The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P163_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P163_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company s assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P163_S3	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P163_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $3,200,000.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P163_S5	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 11 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).

1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Bancorp s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S2	The Bancorp sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S3	The Bancorp successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P165_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	On June 27, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P166_S3	This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P166_S4	On May 22, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P167_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P167_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P167_S3	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options and warrants for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P167_S4	Stock options and warrants not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 172,000, 632,000 and 721,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (Continued) Stock Options In 2001, the Company established a Stock Option Plan for which 365,059 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S1	In May 2013, the Company established the 2013 Stock Option Plan for which 500,000 shares of common stock are reserved and available for future grants to employees and directors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S2	The Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S3	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash, with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months, in options of the Optionee that are fully vested and exercisable or in any combination of the foregoing.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S4	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P168_S5	No grants have been made under the 2013 plan.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P169_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P169_S2	The total fair value of options vested was $52,000 and $89,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (Continued) Regulatory Capital The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P170_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S3	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S4	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P171_S5	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

1168455_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P176_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P176_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P176_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	At December 31, 2013 total deferred tax assets were approximately $5,818,000 and total deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1,420,000 for a net deferred tax asset of $4,398,000.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carry-forwards, tax benefits related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities and timing differences in the tax deductibility of impairment charges on other real estate owned and deferred compensation.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P177_S2	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S5	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P179_S6	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P180_S1	The significant items comprising these differences consisted of the following:
1168455_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	INCOME TAXES (Continued) At year-end 2013, the Company had federal operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $903,000 which expire at various dates from 2029 to 2031.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P181_S1	In addition, at year end 2013, the Company had state operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $10,645,000 which expire at various dates from 2029 to 2031.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	Deferred tax assets are recognized for net operating losses because the benefit is more likely than not to be realized.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California jurisdictions.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company conducts all of its business activities in the states of California and Nevada.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	There are currently no pending U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P184_S2	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2010, and by state and local taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2009.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P184_S3	The unrecognized tax benefits and changes therein and the interest and penalties accrued by the Company as of or during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were not significant.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P184_S4	The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
1168455_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties, including executive officers and directors.

1168455_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, extended hours, remote deposit operations and drive-up banking, all provided with a high level of customer service.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $16.2 thousand at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	These include cashier s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers, on-line banking, remote deposit, mobile banking and other customary banking services.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	The balance in this product at December 31, 2014 was $9.6 million.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn commercial lending office, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P25_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	We offer various loan products which encourage job growth and support community economic development.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, automobile and government-guaranteed community infrastructure loans.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Capital Purchase Program - TARP - Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant .
1168455_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Bancorp s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Bancorp sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Bancorp successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S6	On June 27, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S7	On October 25, 2013, Plumas Bancorp repurchased the remaining 3,133 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from a third party private investor for $3,101,670 plus accrued dividends of $30,453.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S8	This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P30_S9	On May 22, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the Trust I ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Debentures and trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly based on the floating rate described above on the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per security.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Company has entered into contractual agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee payment of: (1) accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the capital securities; (2) the redemption price with respect to any capital securities called for redemption by either Trust I or Trust II, and (3) payments due upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up, or liquidation of either Trust I or Trust II.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued $7.5 million in subordinated debentures ( subordinated debt ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender ) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	The subordinated debt agreement provides that in the event of default with respect to the subordinated debt, the Bancorp will be subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions to shareholders, repurchase or redemption of the Bancorp s securities and payment on certain debts or guarantees.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The subordinated debenture agreement also provides that in the event of default, Lender will have the right to appoint a director to the Bancorp s board of directors and/or the Plumas Bank board in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant ) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $756,000 and $541,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Company allocated the proceeds received on April 15, 2013 between the subordinated debt and the Lender Warrant based on the estimated relative fair value of each.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	The fair value of the Warrant was estimated based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model and totaled $318,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	The discount recorded on the subordinated note will be amortized by the level-yield method over 2 years.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note (the Note ) payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	"Prime Rate" plus three-quarters percent per annum, 4.00% at December 31, 2014 and 2013, has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Interest expense related to this note for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $111,000 and $23,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	Under the Note the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P46_S5	The Bank was in compliance with all such requirements at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	On July 28, 2014, Plumas Bancorp entered into a Renewal, Extension, and Modification of Loan Agreement (the Agreement ) related to the Note.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	This Agreement provides for the following changes, among others:
1168455_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	The maximum amount of the Note is $7.5 million.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Company may borrow, repay, and reborrow up to the principal face amount of the Note.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	The above provisions are subject to the following conditions:
1168455_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	An advance under the Note in excess of $3 million is subject to the lender completing a satisfactory loan review of the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	The Company shall provide an assignment of Key Man life Policy(s) in a minimum amount of $3.5 million.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Company shall not prepay the Company s Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures until the Note has been paid in full.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	On August 26, 2014 the Company made a $2 million payment on the Note reducing the outstanding balance to $1 million.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Proceeds from the Note and the subordinated debt were used to partially fund the repurchase of preferred stock.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Effective February 8, 2012, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ) which, among other things, requested that the Bank maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	The FDIC and DFI terminated the informal agreement effective January 24, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	On July 28, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the "FRB Agreement").
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Under the terms of the FRB Agreement, Plumas Bancorp agreed to take certain actions that are designed to maintain its financial soundness so that it may continue to serve as a source of strength to the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Among other things, the FRB Agreement required prior written approval related to the payment or taking of dividends and distributions, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, incurrence of debt, and the purchase or redemption of stock.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	In addition, the FRB Agreement required Plumas Bancorp to submit, within 60 days of the FRB Agreement, a written statement of Plumas Bancorp s planned sources and uses of cash for debt service, operating expense and other purposes ( Cash Flow Statement ) for the remainder of 2011 and annually thereafter.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S4	The Company submitted the Cash Flow Statements within the required time frames.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P57_S5	On April 19, 2013 the Company received notice that the FRB Agreement had been terminated.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Banks assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	However, at December 31, 2014 approximately 74% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Currently, within the towns in which the Bank has a branch there are 51 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 28 branches of 8 major banks.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	As of June 30, 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 65%, Quincy 57%, Alturas 66%, Fall River Mills 37%, Kings Beach 32%, Susanville 28%,Truckee 17%, Tahoe City 9%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville and Portola.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Redding is the location of our most recently opened branch, which became operational in June 2007.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P66_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P67_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company and its subsidiary employed 155 persons.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 133 persons.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including Plumas Bancorp s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	This Code of Ethics Policy is available on Plumas Bancorp s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P70_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ) has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P76_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Since December 31, 1992, the FRB and the FDIC have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 8%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items of 4%.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P78_S3	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P78_S4	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	The Company is also required to maintain certain levels of capital.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and the Company as of December 31, 2014 were as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Company and the Bank met all of the above capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( FDICIA ) requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The Company could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these regulatory capital guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Banks with capital ratios below the required minimums are subject to certain administrative actions, including prompt corrective action, the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P86_S3	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P86_S4	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	The phase-in period for the final rules begin on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	As of January 1, 2015, the Company s and the Bank s capital levels remained well-capitalized under the new rules.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company s assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $5,100,000.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Federal and State Bank Regulation .
1168455_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Bank, as a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO ), the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ).
1168455_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	The DBO regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P91_S3	As of the most recent CRA examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P92_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P92_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P94_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	In addition to supervising and regulating state chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P95_S3	The Bank s FDIC insurance expense totaled $0.4 million for 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ( FICO ), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged less than 0.01% of deposits in fiscal 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	Under California law, the termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would result in a termination of the Bank s charter.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P98_S2	Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following:
1168455_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P102_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	The Fair Housing Act ( FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P103_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P104_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act ( RFPA ) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P106_S1	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance with generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act ( GLBA ) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S1	he GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S2	Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S3	The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S4	The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S5	The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P113_S6	Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	Under federal law, the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FDIC for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P114_S2	The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P114_S3	The FRB has the authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the Hawaii legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P115_S2	Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management s plans.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P115_S3	No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P116_S1	The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P116_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	The Company s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company s earnings.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P117_S2	These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of New Accounting Standards of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1168455_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Of the Company s eleven depository branches, ten are owned and one is leased.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company also leases three lending offices and one administrative/lending office, and owns four administrative facilities.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Non-branch administrative or credit administrative offices.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	Total rental expenses under all leases, including premises, totaled $192,000, $154,000 and $153,000, in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2015 and the last such lease expiring during 2016.
1168455_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	Future minimum lease payments in thousands of dollars are as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Company maintains insurance coverage on its premises, leaseholds and equipment, including business interruption and record reconstruction coverage.

1168455_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company recorded net income of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a 38% increase over net income of $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Pretax income increased by $2.2 million, or 40%, from $5.6 million in 2013 to $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.7 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $159 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Interest on loans increased by $1.3 million and interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	A decrease of $84 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowings of $243 thousand.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net income allocable to common shareholders increased by $1.1 million from $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 to $4.7 million during 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income allocable to common shareholders is calculated by adding discount on redemption of preferred stock and subtracting dividends and discount amortized on preferred stock from net income.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	During 2013 the Company redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock, recording a $565 discount on redemption.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Discount amortized on the preferred stock during 2013 totaled $347 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2014 were $539 million, an increase of $23.1 million from $516 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	An increase of $32.4 million in net loans and $0.3 million in bank owned life insurance was partially offset by decreases of $4.3 million in cash and due from banks, $23 thousand in investment securities, $0.9 million in premises and equipment, $2.9 million in OREO and $1.5 million in other assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Total deposits increased by $18.5 million from $449 million at December 31, 2013 to $468 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2014 as evidenced by increases of $17.8 million in demand deposits and $12.3 million in savings accounts.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Time deposits declined by $6.3 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) declined by $0.5 million and money market accounts declined by $4.8 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Total shareholders equity increased by $5.9 million from $30.6 million at December 31, 2013 to $36.5 million at December 31, 2014.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets .
1168455_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	An increase of $1.7 million, or 8.7% in interest income, from $19.4 million during 2013 to $21.1 million during the current year, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $159 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $13 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $19.5 million during 2014 and $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The following table compares loan balances by type at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.52% for 2014 down from 5.66% for 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area as well as an increase in lower yielding automobile loans as a percentage of total loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 32 basis points from 1.40% during 2013 to 1.72% during 2014 and an increase in average balance from $82.8 million in 2013 to $87.9 million in 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase in yield on investment securities incudes an increase in government sponsored agency residential mortgage backed securities and municipal securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $137 thousand in 2014 and $124 thousand in 2013, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $84 thousand, or 14%, to $516 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, down from $600 thousand in 2013.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.43% during 2013 to 0.36% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of higher rate time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $14 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 2 basis points from 0.11% during 2013 to 0.09% during 2014.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Interest expense on money market accounts decreased by $17 thousand related to a decrease in rate paid on these accounts of 3 basis points from 0.17% during 2013 to 0.14% during 2014 and a decline in average balances from $48.7 million during 2013 to $46.7 million in 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $16 thousand as we continued to experience strong growth in this category of deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	Average savings deposits increased by $18.2 million from $84.5 million during 2013 to $102.7 million during 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	The average rate paid on savings accounts during this same period declined from 17 basis points during 2013 to 16 basis points during 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P38_S7	The decline in rates paid on deposits is consistent with a decline in competitive market rates in our service area.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $243 thousand from $934 thousand during the twelve months ending December 31, 2013 to $1,177 thousand during 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	This increase was mostly related to an increase of $215 thousand in interest expense on a $7.5 million subordinated debenture which was only outstanding for 8.5 months during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant ) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	The effective yield on the debenture during 2014 was 10.3% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note dated October 24, 2013 payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	"Prime Rate" plus three-quarters percent per annum (currently 4%), has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Proceeds from this note were used to help fund the redemption of the remaining preferred shares during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	Interest expense on this note for 2013 totaled $23 thousand and for 2014 it totaled $111 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	The increase relates mostly to an increase in average balance from $567 thousand in 2013 to $2.3 million during 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which decreased by $10 thousand from 2013, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest on other borrowings, which during 2014 relates to repurchase agreements, totaled $7 thousand in 2014 and $57 thousand in 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2014 increased slightly to 4.05%, from 4.03% for 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, up $775 thousand, or 4.5%, from $17.2 million for 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	An increase of $1.0 million, or 5.6% in interest income, from $18.4 million during 2012 to $19.4 million during the current year, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $260 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $747 thousand, interest on investment securities increased by $270 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $18 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $18.2 million during 2013 and $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The largest areas of loan growth were in our commercial real estate and auto portfolios.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	We have dedicated significant resources to our loan production activities and have emphasized the need for quality and diversified growth in the portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The average yields on loans were 5.66% for 2013 down from 5.77% for 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to intense pricing competition in our service area.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $270 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 12 basis points from 1.28% during 2012 to 1.40% during 2013 and an increase in average balance from $69.7 million in 2012 to $82.8 million in 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in yield incudes an increase in government sponsored agency residential mortgage backed securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest income on interest-bearing deposits, which totaled $124 thousand in 2013 and $106 thousand in 2012, mostly relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Interest expense on deposits decreased by $247 thousand, or 29%, to $600 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, down from $847 thousand in 2012.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.67% during 2012 to 0.43% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of higher rate time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Interest expense on NOW accounts declined by $21 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 2 basis points from 0.13% during 2012 to 0.11% during 2013.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P51_S7	The average rate paid on savings accounts during this same period declined from 19 basis points during 2012 to 17 basis points during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P51_S8	The decline in rates paid on deposits is consistent with a decline in competitive market rates in our service area.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $507 thousand from $427 thousand during the twelve months ending December 31, 2012 to $934 thousand during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	This increase was related to $541 thousand in interest expense on the $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	The effective yield on the debenture was 10.4% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures decreased by $31 thousand from 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Interest expense on our outstanding note payable for 2013 totaled $23 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Interest on other borrowings, which totaled $57 thousand in 2013 and $83 thousand in 2012, primarily relates to interest paid on repurchase agreements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2013 decreased 15 basis points to 4.03%, from 4.18% for 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million, down $300 thousand from the $1.4 million provision recorded during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	The largest component of this increase was an increase of $196 thousand in service charge income which we attribute to growth in the Company s demand deposit accounts, an increase in debit card interchange income and a restructuring of our service charge fee structure beginning in August of 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	During July and August 2014 we sold fourteen available-for- sale securities totaling $16.2 million recognizing a gain on sale of $128 thousand.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Other non-interest income increased by $176 thousand mostly related to a $148 thousand gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2014.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Salaries and employee benefits increased by $745 thousand primarily related to an increase in bonus expense of $350 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Bank s bonus plan for 2014 provides for a bonus pool of 60% of the amount that pretax income exceeds budgeted pretax income with a cap of $600 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Bonus expense was $600 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and $250 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	In both years the maximum allowed under the bonus plans was earned.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Salary expense, exclusive of commissions, increased by $265 thousand as a decline of four employees from 159 at December 31, 2013 to 155 at December 31, 2014 was offset by an increase in average salary per employee which includes the effect of merit and promotional increases.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Other increases include, but were not limited to an $89 thousand increase in commissions, which relate to government guaranteed loan production, and a $67 thousand increase in payroll tax expense.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Partially offsetting these items was an increase in deferred loan origination costs totaling $104 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Of the $187 thousand increase in outside service fees, $96 thousand was related to the outsourcing of our item processing beginning in June of 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	This cost as been offset by savings in salary and benefit expense and software expense.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition we incurred an increase in costs for the management of our investment portfolio and an increase in costs related to an increase in debit card interchange transactions.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Professional fees benefited from reductions in legal expense related to loan collection activities totaling $148 thousand, a reduction in corporate legal expense of $88 thousand mostly related the repurchase of the preferred stock in 2013 and a reduction in audit expense related to a change in audit firms beginning in 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	The allowance is established through a provision for subsequent losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from impairment are recorded as incurred.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	The provision for OREO losses declined by $246 thousand from $486 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 to $240 thousand during the current period.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	The deposit premium intangible asset was fully amortized at the end of September, 2013 resulting in a savings of $128 thousand during the comparison periods.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Non-interest expense declined by $807 thousand from $18.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 to $17.6 million during 2013.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	During June of 2012 we outsourced the processing of our account statements and notices and during June of 2013 we outsourced our item processing department resulting in savings in salary expense, occupancy and equipment costs, postage and stationary costs.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The $178 thousand reduction in deposit insurance expense is related to a decline in the rate charged to Plumas Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	The reduction in professional fees primarily relates to a decrease in consulting costs.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $239 thousand primarily related to declines in salary continuation expense and stock compensation expense and an increase in deferred loan origination costs.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Salary continuation expense declined by $188 thousand related to an adjustment in 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	During 2012, related to a significant reduction in long term market interest rates, we reduced the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our salary continuation liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	This had the effect of increasing salary continuation expense during 2012 by $195 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S4	Stock compensation expense decreased by $58 thousand from $93 thousand during 2012 to $35 thousand during the current period.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S6	The largest reduction in salary and benefits was related to an increase in deferred loan origination costs totaling $384 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S7	We attribute this increase in deferred loan origination costs to an increase in lending activity.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P75_S8	These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense of $250 thousand and salary expense of $173 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Bank s bonus plan for 2013 provided for a bonus pool of 50% of the amount that pretax income exceeds budgeted pretax income with a cap of $250 thousand.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	There was no bonus plan in place and no bonuses were earned or paid in 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	Salary expense increased by $173 thousand as savings related to the outsourcing of statement and item processing were offset by an increase in loan production personnel and salary increases.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The $486 thousand OREO provision during 2013, a $421 thousand decline from 2012, resulted from declines in value of ten properties.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The $907 thousand in OREO provision during the 2012 was related to a decline in the value of twenty-one properties.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold twenty-eight properties and a portion of another property recording a gain on sale of $171 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	During 2012, we sold fourteen properties and a portion of two other properties recording a loss on sale of $16 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The increase in outside service fees was related to the outsourcing of our statement and notice processing in June of 2012, the outsourcing of our item processing beginning in June of 2013, an increase in costs related to monitoring and maintaining our ATMs and an increase in the cost of managing our investment portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	During 2012 the Bank modernized its ATM network by purchasing new ATM machines which have the ability to accept currency and checks and provide an imaged receipt.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	While these ATMs provide a significant increase in functionality, they are also more expensive to operate and maintain.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	During the first half of 2012 we began to use a third party for assistance with the analysis and management of our investment securities portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase in cost during 2013 for this function was related to a full year of costs and an increase in the balance of our portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	OREO expense during the 2012 period benefited from $80 thousand in rental income net of operating expenses on an apartment building acquired in July 2011.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Both the rental income and the operating expenses are included under the category of OREO expense.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	This building was sold during the third quarter of 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	The remaining increase in OREO expense during 2013 primarily relates to an increase in legal expense as we are actively pursuing additional recoveries on selected OREO properties through legal channels.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Provision for I ncome T axes.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.1 million, or 39.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The percentages for 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance, municipal loan interest and in 2013 state of California enterprise zone interest, decrease taxable income.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is "more likely than not" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Net loans increased by $32.4 million, or 10%, from $334.4 million at December 31, 2013 to $366.8 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The two largest areas of growth in the Company s loan portfolio were $14.3 million in automobile loans and $7.4 million in commercial real estate loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Additionally, construction and land development loans increased by $6.8 million to $24.6 million and agricultural loans increased by $4.7 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	These commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	As shown in the following table the Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and commercial loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Construction and land development loans represented 6.6% and 5.3% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 7% during the last two years reflects management s efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 74% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, approximately 71% and 73%, respectively of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, 42% and 40%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 12.1% of gross loans at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $35 million at December 31, 2014 and $31 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	It consists of the Bank s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million down $300 thousand from the $1.4 million provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 down $403 thousand from $1.6 million during 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 0.49% during 2013 to 0.33% during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	The allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $65 thousand from $629 thousand at December 31, 2013 to $564 thousand at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	General reserves were $4.9 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.63% at December 31, 2013 to 1.47% at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans decreased from 1.49% at December 31, 2013 to 1.35% at December 31, 2014 primarily related to reductions in historical net charge-offs.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P114_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	Loans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $2.0 million, $4.5 million, $5.4 million, $8.6 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 6 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2014 were $6.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million from the $5.5 million balance at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $522 thousand at December 31, 2014 and $578 thousand at December 31, 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days increased by $0.1 million from $1.5 million at December 31, 2013 to $1.6 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	Total substandard loans increased by $612 thousand from $7.5 million at December 31, 2013 to $8.1 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P124_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased by $1.4 million from $5.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $4.4 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P124_S3	At December 31, 2014, $1.6 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P124_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $8.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $564 thousand and $629 thousand at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	Additionally, $0.7 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2014 and December 31 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2014 is appropriate.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P126_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	OREO holdings represented fifteen properties totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2014 and twenty-six properties totaling $6.4 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S3	During June 2014 the Company sold its largest property in OREO, a land development property with an OREO value of $2.2 million which represented 36% of the total OREO balance prior to sale.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S4	A gain of $28 thousand was recorded on the sale of this property.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P127_S5	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 1.90% at December 31, 2014 and 2.33% at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, dollars in thousands:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	Total investment securities were $90.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P129_S2	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 we sold investment securities with a book balance of $16.2 million and recognized a gain on sale of $128 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P129_S3	The investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 consisted of $77.3 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, 52 municipal securities totaling $12.5 million and one corporate security totaling $0.5 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P129_S4	Included in the $90.3 million at December 31, 2013 were $89.0 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and six municipal securities totaling $1.3 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) totaling $22.9 million at December 31, 2014 and $29.1 million at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	These balances currently earn 25 basis points.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P131_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	During 2013 and continuing into 2014 we have experienced strong core deposit growth and have benefited from the closing of two branches of a large national bank in our service area.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	Total deposits increased by $18.5 million from $449 million at December 31, 2013 to $468 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2014 as evidenced by increases of $17.8 million in demand deposits and $12.3 million in savings accounts.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	Time deposits declined by $6.3 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P136_S4	Interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) declined by $0.5 million and money market accounts declined by $4.8 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	The following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P138_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2014 or 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2014:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company s local business and individual customer base.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	The potential impact on the Company s liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company s asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	S hort - term Borrowing Arrangements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $133,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $205,000,000.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S2	The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company held $2,380,000 and $2,226,000 of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S4	Based on the level of stock holdings at December 31, 2014, the Company can borrow up to $50,600,000.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S5	To borrow the $133,000,000 in available credit the Company would need to purchase $3,900,000 in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S6	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $11 million, $10 million and $10 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P142_S7	There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB or the correspondent banks under these agreements at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	On October 24, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $3 million promissory note (the Note ) payable to an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	The note bears interest at the U.S.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S2	"Prime Rate" plus three-quarters percent per annum, 4.00% at December 31, 2014 and 2013, has a term of 18 months and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company s 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S3	Interest expense related to this note for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $111,000 and $23,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S4	Under the Note the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P143_S5	The Bank was in compliance with all such requirements at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	On July 28, 2014, Plumas Bancorp entered into a Renewal, Extension, and Modification of Loan Agreement (the Agreement ) related to the Note.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P144_S1	This Agreement provides for the following changes, among others:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	The maximum amount of the Note is $7.5 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Company may borrow, repay, and reborrow up to the principal face amount of the Note.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	The above provisions are subject to the following conditions:
1168455_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	An advance under the Note in excess of $3 million is subject to the lender completing a satisfactory loan review of the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	The Company shall provide an assignment of Key Man life Policy(s) in a minimum amount of $3.5 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	The Company shall not prepay the Company s Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures until the Note has been paid in full.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	On August 26, 2014 the Company made a $2 million payment on the Note reducing the outstanding balance to $1 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	In 2011 Plumas Bank introduced a new product for their larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	The balance in this product at December 31, 2014 was $9.6 million an increase of $0.5 million from the December 31, 2013 balance of $9.1 million.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P152_S2	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	On April 15, 2013, to help fund the repurchase of preferred stock during 2013, the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P153_S1	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P153_S2	The effective yield on the debenture was 10.3% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P153_S3	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $756,000 and $541,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	The subordinated debt agreement provides that in the event of default with respect to the subordinated debt, the Bancorp will be subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions to shareholders, repurchase or redemption of the Bancorp s securities and payment on certain debts or guarantees.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	The subordinated debenture agreement also provides that in the event of default, Lender will have the right to appoint a director to the Bancorp s board of directors and/or the Plumas Bank board in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	Under current capital guidelines the subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital; however, under Basel III guidelines effective January 1, 2015 it does not qualify for regulatory capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures .
1168455_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are Connecticut business trusts formed by the Company with capital of $304,000 and $161,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	Under current applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust preferred securities (TRUPS) that is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to twenty-five percent of the Company s Tier 1 capital, as defined, on a pro forma basis.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	At December 31, 2014, all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	Under Basel III guidelines the twenty-five percent limitation applies to Tier 1 capital exclusive of the TRUPS which we expect will result in a portion of the TRUPS not qualifying as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P157_S3	The amount of the TRUPS that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital will be included in Tier 2 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	During 2002, Plumas Statutory Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities ("Trust Preferred Securities"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P158_S3	The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	Trust I s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 3.66% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P159_S1	Trust II s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 1.72% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	Total shareholders equity increased by $5.9 million from $30.6 million at December 31, 2013 to $36.5 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	The $5.9 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $4.7 million and a decrease in net unrealized loss on investment securities of $1.1 million with the balance of $0.1 million representing stock option activity.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P162_S1	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors (the Board).
1168455_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P164_S1	No common cash dividends were paid during the last five years.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, with risk-based capital ratios calculated separately for the Company and the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P167_S2	There are two categories of capital under the guidelines: Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders equity, and qualifying trust-preferred securities (including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other deductions, notably the unrealized net gains or losses (after tax adjustments) on available-for-sale investment securities carried at fair market value; Tier 2 capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P167_S3	The Series A Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (amounts in thousands except percentage amounts).
1168455_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	Management believes that the Company and the Bank currently meet their entire capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized leverage, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of 5%, 6% and 10%, respectively, at all times.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S2	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S3	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S4	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S5	Under current capital guidelines the Company s subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital; however, under Basel III guidelines effective January 1, 2015 it does not qualify for regulatory capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S6	Additionally, the Basel III rules have reduced the amount of TRUPS that is eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 capital which will we expect will result in a portion of the TRUPS not qualifying as Tier 1 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P171_S7	The amount that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital will qualify as Tier 2 capital.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	The phase-in period for the final rules begin on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P172_S1	As of January 1, 2015, the Company s and the Bank s capital levels remained well-capitalized under the new rules.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $89.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and no letters of credit.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S3	This compares to $84.2 million in unfunded loan commitments and $60 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S4	Of the $89.7 million in unfunded loan commitments, $52.3 million and $37.4 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2014, $41.7 million were secured by real estate, of which $14.8 million was secured by commercial real estate and $26.9 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P174_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Company leases one depository branch, three lending offices, one loan administration office and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $192,000 and $154,000 during the years ended December, 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P175_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2015 and the last such lease expiring during 2016.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P176_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $133,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $205,000,000.

1168455_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P179_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_15_ITEM7_P179_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation, expansion and diversification.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Effective February 8, 2012, the Bank entered into an informal agreement with the FDIC and DFI which, among other things, requested that the Bank continue to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 9% which is in excess of that required for well capitalized institutions and continue to reduce its level of classified asset balances that were outstanding as of September 30, 2011 to not more than 50% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	At December 31, 2012 this ratio was 32% and the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio was 10.4%.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	On April 19, 2013 the Company received notice that the FRB Agreement had been terminated.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Cash held with other federally insured institutions in excess of FDIC limits as of December 31, 2014 was $12.0 million.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	Net cash flows are reported for customer loans and deposit transactions and repurchase agreements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S3	The term "other than temporary" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P33_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, FHLB stock totaled $2,380,000 and $2,226,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company had $3.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $76,797,000 and $70,212,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S3	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S4	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P39_S5	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan, the servicing asset, the interest-only (IO) strip, and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The servicing asset is recognized and amortized over the estimated life of the related loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Assets (accounted for as IO strips) are recorded at the fair value of the difference between note rates and rates paid to purchasers (the interest spread) and contractual servicing fees, if applicable.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	IO strips are carried at fair value with gains or losses recorded as a component of shareholders equity, similar to available-for-sale investment securities.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P42_S4	Significant future prepayments of these loans will result in the recognition of additional amortization of related servicing assets and an adjustment to the carrying value of related IO strips.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P43_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company may not "carry over" or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 (the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	During 2012, the Company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non-impaired loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	This modification incorporated historical losses from the beginning of the latest business cycle.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	Previously we utilized historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S4	This modification had the effect of increasing the required allowance related to the expanded historical loss period by $250,000.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P60_S5	The Company believes that, given the recent trend in historical losses, it was prudent to increase the period examined and that a full business cycle was the appropriate period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans and credit card receivables.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, with the exception of automobile and other loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described on the next page.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Commercial Commercial loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Real estate Residential and H ome E quity L ines of C redit The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P76_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P76_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	R e al e state Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P77_S2	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P77_S3	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating .
1168455_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer and credit card loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DBO, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $141,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $3,590,000 ($5,884,000 less a valuation allowance of $2,294,000) at December 31, 2014 and $6,399,000 ($9,065,000 less a valuation allowance of $2,666,000) at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $3,399,000, $2,404,000 and $3,714,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company recorded gains on sale of other real estate owned of $101,000 and $171,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company recorded a loss on sale of other real estate owned of $16,000.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S5	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S6	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P84_S7	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are also recorded in other expenses as incurred.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over ten years.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	These assets were fully amortized as of December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	There were no such events or circumstances in 2013 or 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P98_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P98_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income plus discount on redemption of preferred stock less preferred dividends and accretion) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	There were no sales of available for sale investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P101_S3	The amount reclassified out of other accumulated comprehensive income relating to realized gains on securities available for sale was $128,000 and $403,000 for 2014 and 2012, with the related tax effect of $53,000 and $167,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plans, net of related tax benefit, recorded in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $75,000, $37,000 and $93,000 or $0.02, $0.01 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P105_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	During 2014 the Company granted options to purchase 110,400 shares of common stock.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P107_S1	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	The FASB issued ASU 2013-11 to eliminate the diversity in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	The Company has determined the provisions for ASU 2013-11 did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	In January 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	The objective of this guidance is to clarify when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, that is, when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan receivable should be derecognized and the real estate property recognized.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	ASU No. 2014-04 states that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	Additionally, ASU No. 2014-04 requires interim and annual disclosure of both (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P111_S3	The adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Financial Statements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	This update to the ASC is the culmination of efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1168455_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	ASU 2014-09 supersedes Topic 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 describes a 5-step process entities can apply to achieve the core principle of revenue recognition and requires disclosures sufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and the significant judgments used in determining that information.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The amendments in ASU 2014-9 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early application is not allowed.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and disclosures, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The Update improves the financial reporting of repurchase agreements and other similar transactions through a change in accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase financings, and the introduction of two new disclosure requirements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	New disclosures are required for (1) transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements, in which the transferor retains substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial asset throughout the term of the transaction and (2) repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings about the nature of collateral pledged and the time to maturity of those transactions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P115_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-011 on its financial statements and disclosures, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P121_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2).
1168455_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P130_S2	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	The fair value of the Company s Note Payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	Su bordinated debentures and Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures : The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P139_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 are summarized below:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2013 are summarized below:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P145_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2014 or 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P145_S3	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2014 are summarized below:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2013 are summarized below:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or loans that have been subject to partial charge-offs are generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P151_S1	These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P151_S2	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P151_S3	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	Total losses of $125,000 and $24,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P153_S2	These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P154_S1	Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P154_S2	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P154_S3	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands) :
1168455_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	Net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $102,000 were recorded, net of $42,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company sold fourteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $16,325,000 recording a $128,000 gain on sale.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P157_S2	The Company realized a gain on sale from thirteen of these securities totaling $134,000 and a loss on sale on one security of $6,000.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	Net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $1,980,000 were recorded, net of $817,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $561,000 were recorded, net of $232,000 in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company sold twenty-five available-for-sale investment securities for $20,773,000, recording a $403,000 gain on sale.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P159_S2	No securities were sold at a loss.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	There were no transfers of available-for-sale investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	Investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company held 120 securities of which 42 were in a loss position.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P162_S1	Of the securities in a loss position, 14 were in a loss position for less than twelve months.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P162_S2	Of the 42 securities 4 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies 29 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations and 9 were obligations of states and political subdivisions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions.

1168455_15_ITEM8_P231_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P231_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P231_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P231_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	At December 31, 2014, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 12% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P232_S1	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 42% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P232_S2	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 46% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P232_S3	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P234_S2	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P235_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P236_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P236_S2	The California general corporation law prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its common stock unless: (i) its retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or (ii) immediately after giving effect to the dividend, the sum of the Company s assets (exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred liabilities) and the current assets of the Company would be at least equal to its current liabilities, or, if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years, at least equal to 125% of its current liabilities.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P237_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $5,100,000.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P237_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 11 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Bancorp entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Bancorp issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S0	On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Bancorp s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S2	The Bancorp sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S3	The Bancorp successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P239_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	On June 27, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P240_S1	On October 25, 2013, Plumas Bancorp repurchased the remaining 3,133 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from a third party private investor.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P240_S2	The Company paid $3,101,670 plus accrued dividends of $30,453.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P240_S3	This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P240_S4	On May 22, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P241_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options and warrants for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	Stock options and warrants not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 238,000, 172,000 and 632,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P242_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 one stock warrant was outstanding to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P242_S3	At December 31, 2012 one stock warrant was outstanding to purchase up to 237,712 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $7.54 per share.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	In 2001, the Company established a Stock Option Plan for which 306,393 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	As of December 31, 2014, there was $10,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2001 Plan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.2 years.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	The total fair value of options vested was $49,000 and $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P245_S1	The total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $51,000 and $34,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P246_S0	$34,000 in cash was received from option exercises for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P246_S1	A tax benefit of $13,000 was realized for the tax deduction from options exercised in 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P246_S2	There was no tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from options exercised in 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P247_S0	A summary of the activity within the 2001 Stock Option Plan follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P248_S0	In May 2013, the Company established the 2013 Stock Option Plan for which 500,000 shares of common stock are reserved and 389,600 shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P248_S1	The Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P248_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash, with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months, in options of the Optionee that are fully vested and exercisable or in any combination of the foregoing.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P248_S3	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P248_S4	Options granted during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 110,400 and 0 options, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P249_S0	As of December 31, 2014, there was $186,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested, share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2013 Plan.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P249_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.3 years.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P250_S0	A summary of the activity within the 2013 Plan follows:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P251_S0	Compensation cost related to stock options recognized in operating results under the two stock option plans was $81,000 and $38,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P251_S1	The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P252_S0	The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P252_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P253_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P253_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P253_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P254_S0	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P254_S1	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P254_S2	Management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P255_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P255_S1	Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P255_S2	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P255_S3	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P255_S4	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P256_S0	The following tables present the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank compared to the standards for bank holding companies and the regulatory minimum requirements for depository institutions as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P257_S0	Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P258_S0	The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P259_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P260_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P260_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P261_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P261_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P261_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P261_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	At December 31, 2014 total deferred tax assets were approximately $4,023,000 and total deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1,626,000 for a net deferred tax asset of $2,397,000.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P262_S1	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carry-forwards, tax benefits related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities and timing differences in the tax deductibility of impairment charges on other real estate owned and deferred compensation.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P262_S2	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is "more likely than not" that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P263_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P264_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P264_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P264_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P264_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P264_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P265_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P265_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P266_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P266_S1	The significant items comprising these differences consisted of the following:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P267_S0	At year-end 2014, the Company had state operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $3,300,000 which expire at various dates from 2029 to 2031.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P268_S0	Deferred tax assets are recognized for net operating losses because the benefit is more likely than not to be realized.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P269_S0	The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California jurisdictions.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P270_S0	The Company conducts all of its business activities in the states of California and Nevada.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P270_S1	There are currently no pending U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P271_S0	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2011, and by state and local taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2010.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P272_S0	The unrecognized tax benefits and changes therein and the interest and penalties accrued by the Company as of or during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were not significant.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P272_S1	The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P273_S0	During the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties, including executive officers and directors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P273_S1	The following is a summary of the aggregate activity involving related party borrowers during 2014:
1168455_15_ITEM8_P274_S0	The Plumas Bank Profit Sharing Plan commenced April 1, 1988 and is available to employees meeting certain service requirements.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P274_S1	Under the Plan, employees are able to defer a selected percentage of their annual compensation.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P274_S2	Included under the Plan s investment options is the option to invest in Company stock.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P274_S3	No contribution was made for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P275_S0	Salary continuation and retirement agreements are in place for two key executives and seven members of the Board of Directors as well as four former executives and four former directors.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P275_S1	Under these agreements, the directors and executives will receive monthly payments for twelve to fifteen years, respectively, after retirement.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P275_S2	The estimated present value of these future benefits is accrued over the period from the effective dates of the agreements until the participants expected retirement dates.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P275_S3	The expense recognized under these plans for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $289,000, $286,000 and $507,000, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P275_S4	Accrued compensation payable under these plans totaled $4,007,000 and $4,009,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_15_ITEM8_P276_S0	In connection with these agreements, the Bank purchased single premium life insurance policies with cash surrender values totaling $11,845,000 and $11,504,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

1168455_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary (the Company ), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management, including the undersigned Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as of December 31, 2014.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In conducting its assessment, management used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Bank s Government-guaranteed lending center, headquartered in Auburn, California with additional personnel in Truckee, California and Scottsdale, Arizona provides Small Business Administration (SBA) and USDA Rural Development loans to qualified borrowers throughout Northern California, Arizona, Oregon and Northern Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	During 2007 the Bank was granted nationwide Preferred Lender status with the U.S. Small Business Administration and we expect government-guaranteed lending to continue to be an important part of our overall lending operation.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the principal areas to which we directed our lending activities, and the percentage of our total loan portfolio comprised by each, were as follows: (i) commercial real estate 47.9%; (ii) commercial and industrial loans 9.2%; (iii) consumer loans (including residential equity lines of credit and automobile loans) 22.6%; (iv) agricultural loans (including agricultural real estate loans) 9.9%; (v) residential real estate 6.4%; and (vi) construction and land development 4.0% .

1168455_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Interest bearing deposits include high yield sweep accounts designed for our commercial customers and for public entities such as municipalities.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition we offer a premium interest bearing checking account for our consumer customers.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 29,518 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $528 million, compared to 28,821 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $469 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, mobile and internet banking, remote deposit operations and drive-up banking, all provided with a high level of customer service.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $17.9 thousand at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	These include cashier s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers and other customary banking services.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our business customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	The balance in this product at December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee and Redding have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn SBA lending office and growth in our indirect automobile lending, the agriculture-related base has become less significant.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P25_S3	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P25_S4	There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, automobile and Government-guaranteed loans.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	On July 31, 2015 the Bank completed its acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	The branch, located at 1335 Hilltop Dr. in Redding, now operates as a branch of the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Bank has consolidated its Civic Center Drive branch into this new location.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Company s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Company sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	The Company successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P31_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P31_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.

1168455_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the Trust II ).
1168455_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the Debentures ) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities ( trust preferred securities ), which were sold to a third party.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender ) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	On April 16, 2015 the Company paid off the subordinated debt.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The subordinated debt had an interest rate of 7.5% per annum and a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $219,000, $756,000 and $541,000, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Company has a $4.9 million note payable outstanding at December 31, 2015 with an unrelated commercial bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	In addition, the Company has the ability to borrow an additional $2.5 million from this same bank under a line of credit agreement.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	There were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Condition Note Payable for detail information related to these borrowing agreements.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank s assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	However, at December 31, 2015 approximately 73% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Currently, within the California towns in which the Bank has a branch there are 51 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 28 branches of 8 major banks.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	As of June 30, 2015, the FDIC estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 65%, Quincy 55%, Alturas 65%, Fall River Mills 38%, Kings Beach 35%, Susanville 27%,Truckee 18%, Tahoe City 10%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville and Portola.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary employed 151 persons.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 134 persons.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	This Code of Ethics is available on the Company s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P56_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ).
1168455_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ).
1168455_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	As a California-chartered commercial bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the DBO and the FDIC, as well as certain of the regulations of the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).
1168455_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	The DBO and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P64_S4	Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S4	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P67_S5	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	For additional information, see Item 7.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Standards.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	It is the Federal Reserve s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings support the organization s expected future needs and financial condition.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	Further, it is the FRB s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $5,100,000.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the trust preferred securities issued by the Company s business trust subsidiaries.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	As of the most recent report of examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB s Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	In addition to supervising and regulating state chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	The Bank s FDIC insurance expense totaled $333 thousand for 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ( FICO ), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	The Bank s FICO assessments totaled $29 thousand for 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Under California law, the termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would result in a termination of the Bank s charter.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	Accordingly, banks may now enter new markets more freely.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following:
1168455_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Fair Housing Act ( FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act ( RFPA ) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance with generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	Smaller institutions, including the Bank, will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. .
1168455_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	Under the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act ( GLBA ) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S3	The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S4	The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S5	The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P96_S6	Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	Under federal law, the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FDIC for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, the payment of restitution and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P97_S3	The FRB has the authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P98_S2	Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management s plans.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P98_S3	No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Company s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company s earnings.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P100_S2	These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of New Accounting Standards of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	A deterioration of national or local economic conditions could reduce the Company s profitability.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s lending operations and its customers are primarily located in the eastern region of Northern California.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A significant downturn in the national economy or the local economy due to agricultural commodity prices, real estate prices, public policy decisions, natural disaster, drought or other factors could result in a decline in the local economy in general, which could in turn negatively impact the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The majority of the Company s assets are loans, which if not repaid would result in losses to the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Bank, like other lenders, is subject to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Underwriting and documentation controls cannot mitigate all credit risk.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in the Company s market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers ability to repay.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	To the extent loans are not paid timely by borrowers, the loans are placed on non-accrual status, thereby reducing interest income.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Further, under these circumstances, an additional provision for loan and lease losses or unfunded commitments may be required.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses .
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If the Company s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual loan losses, the Company s profitability could be reduced.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The risk of loan losses is inherent in the lending business.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon the Company s actual losses over a relevant time period and management s assessment of all relevant qualitative factors that may cause future loss experience to differ from its historical loss experience.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for determining the allowance for loan losses, it can give no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses, or if bank regulatory agencies require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses, earnings could be significantly and adversely impacted.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A deterioration in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 73% of the Company s total loan portfolio is secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s earnings depend largely upon net interest income, which is the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowed funds).
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities are affected principally by direct competition, and general economic conditions at the state and national level and other factors beyond the Company s control such as actions of the FRB, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and other state and federal economic policies.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for managing the impact of possible interest rate fluctuations on earnings, the Company can provide no assurance that its management efforts will prevent earnings from being significantly and adversely impacted by changes in interest rates.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company could be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Federal and state bank regulatory authorities require the Company and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The Company s ability to raise additional capital if and as needed depends on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside the Company s control, and on the Company s financial performance.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could be required to curtail its growth strategy or reduce the levels of assets owned.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, although the Company and the Bank are currently well-capitalized under applicable regulatory frameworks, bank regulators are authorized and sometimes required to impose a wide range of requirements, conditions, and restrictions on banks and bank holding companies that fail to maintain adequate capital levels.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The continuing California drought could have an adverse impact on the Company s business.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	During 2015, California continued to experience a severe drought.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A significant portion of the Company s borrowers are involved in or are dependent on the agricultural industry in California, which requires water.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 10% of the Company s loans were categorized as agricultural loans.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a result of the drought, there have been governmental proposals concerning the distribution or rationing of water.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If the amount of water available to agriculture becomes scarcer due to drought or rationing, growers may not be able to continue to produce agricultural products profitably, which could force some out of business.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Although many of the Company s customers are not directly involved in agriculture, they could be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry because many jobs and businesses in the Company s market areas are related to the production of agricultural products.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Therefore, the drought could adversely impact the Company s loan portfolio, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company faces substantial competition from larger banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company faces substantial competition for deposits and loans.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Competition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations and other financial intermediaries.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Larger competitors, by virtue of their larger capital resources, have substantially greater lending limits and marketing resources than the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, they have greater resources and may be able to offer longer maturities or lower rates.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The Company s competitors may also provide certain services for their customers, including trust and international banking, that the Company is only able to offer indirectly through correspondent relationships.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Ultimately, competition can reduce the Company s profitability, as well as make it more difficult to increase the size of its loan portfolio and deposit base.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There are risks associated with the Company s growth strategy.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	During the past year, the Company completed the purchase and assumption of a branch office in Redding, California, received regulatory approval to open a branch office in Reno, Nevada and established a loan production office in Scottsdale, Arizona.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The Company may engage in additional acquisition activity and open additional offices in the future to expand the Company s markets or further its growth strategy.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	There is no assurance that future acquisitions or offices will be successful.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Further, growth may strain the Company s administrative, managerial, financial and operational resources and increase demands on its systems and controls.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If the Company pursues its growth strategy too aggressively, fails to attract qualified personnel, control costs or maintain asset quality, or if factors beyond management s control divert attention away from its business operations, the Company s pursuit of its growth strategy could have a material adverse impact on its existing business.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company relies on key executives and personnel and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse impact on the Company s prospects.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California community banking industry.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company s strategies is often lengthy.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The Company s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, compliance and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of its management and personnel.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In particular, the Company s success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives and certain other employees.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Security breaches and technological disruptions could damage the Company s reputation and profitability.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Company s business is highly reliant on third party vendors and its ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company s electronic banking activities expose it to possible liability and loss of reputation should an unauthorized party gain access to confidential customer information.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Despite its considerable efforts and investment to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data, the Company cannot fully guarantee that these precautions will protect its systems from future compromises or breaches of its security measures.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test its security), failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect its ability to offer and grow its online services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact the Bank s reputation, and could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The Company may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company s business.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Integral to the Company s performance is the continued efficacy of the Company s technology and information systems, operational infrastructure and relationships with third parties and its colleagues in its day-to-day and ongoing operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This includes, but is not limited to, operational or systems failures, disruption of client operations and activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as, the loss of key colleagues or failure on the part of key colleagues to perform properly.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, the Company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties which may encounter technological or other difficulties that may significantly affect the Company s ability to process and account for customer transactions.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These vendors provide services that support its operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data, as well as its sales efforts.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A cyber security breach of a vendor s system may result in theft of the Company s data or disruption of business processes.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In most cases, the Company will remain primarily liable to its customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor s data security system.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Company relies on its outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The loss of these vendor relationships could disrupt the services the Company provides to its customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company is subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In the past, the Company s business has been increasingly affected by these regulations, and this trend is likely to continue into the future.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Many of these laws are subject to interpretation and changing regulatory approaches to supervision and enforcement.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The Company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The Company may also suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations, that may also damage its reputation, and this in turn might materially affect its business and results of operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines, restitution or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports it files under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in its control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which could result in a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The trading price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside its control.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Among the factors that could affect the Company s stock price are:
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	domestic and international economic factors unrelated to its performance.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Significant decline in the Company s stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The trading volume of the Company s common stock is limited.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Although the Company s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, trading to date has been relatively modest.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The limited trading market for the Company s common stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies compared to more actively traded securities.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	It may also make it more difficult for investors to sell the Company s common stock at desired prices, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number shares of stock.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company depends primarily on the operations of the Bank to repay its indebtedness.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The Company s ability to pay any dividends or repurchase any of its shares in the future will also depend on the success of the Bank s operations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank, and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with, the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The Company s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Disruptions in market conditions may adversely impact the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities .
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) require the Company to carry its available-for-sale investment securities at fair value on its balance sheet.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost, net of its tax effect, are reported as a component of shareholders equity.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In certain instances GAAP requires recognition through earnings of declines in the fair value of securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Changes in the fair value of these securities may result from a number of circumstances that are beyond the Company s control, such as changes in interest rates, the financial condition of government sponsored enterprises or insurers of municipal bonds, changes in demand for these securities as a result of economic conditions, or reduced market liquidity.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to loss recognition that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s net income and capital levels.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Damage to the Company s reputation could significantly harm the Company s business and prospects.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company s reputation is an important asset.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The Company s relationship with many of its customers is predicated upon its reputation as a high quality provider of financial services that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company s ability to attract and retain customers, investors and employees depends upon external perceptions.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Damage to its reputation among existing and potential customers, investors and employees could cause significant harm to the Company s business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, lending practices, inadequate protection of customer information, sales and marketing efforts, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Adverse developments in the banking industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company s reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The Company has policies and procedures in place that seek to protect its reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Negative publicity regarding the Company s business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors, and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The markets in which the Company operates are subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Most of the Company s offices are located in California.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Also, most of the real and personal properties securing the Company s loans are located in California.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	California its prone to earthquakes, brush fires, flooding and other natural disasters.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties, if there is a major earthquake, brush fires, flood or other natural disaster, the Company faces the risk that many of the Company s borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.
1168455_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Therefore, a major earthquake, brush fire, flood or other natural disaster in California could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

1168455_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company and Bank are limited in their investments in real property under Federal and state banking laws.
1168455_16_ITEM2_P5_S1	Generally, investments in real property are either for the Company and Bank use or are in real property and real property interests in the ordinary course of the Bank s business.
1168455_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company and/or its subsidiary are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of the Company s management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company taken as a whole.

1168455_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company recorded net income of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 23% increase over net income of $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Pretax income increased by $1.7 million, or 22%, from to $9.5 million in 2015 from $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $1.5 million and a decrease in interest expense of $489 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Interest on loans increased by $1.3 million and interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	An increase of $2 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $491 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $537 thousand in interest expense related to the redemption of the Company s $7.5 million subordinated debenture in April, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	The provision for loan losses was $1.1 million during 2015 and 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Non-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	This increase includes an increase in loan production personnel costs, costs associated with our new Reno, Nevada branch, an increase in commissions earned on the sale of SBA loans, related to an increase in sales volume, and merit and promotional wage increases.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The provision for income taxes increased by $631 thousand from $3.1 million in 2014 to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Loans increased by $30.6 million, or 8%, from $370.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $401.0 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in loan balances includes $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $5.6 million in commercial loans, $4.5 million in agricultural loans and $3.7 million in automobile loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	These increases were partially offset by declines of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans and $3.6 million in all other loan types.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Construction and land development loans, which management has identified as a higher-risk loan category, represented 4.0% and 6.6% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	No loans were acquired in this transaction.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2015 as evidenced by increases of $28.4 million in demand deposits, $19.6 million in savings accounts, $9.1 million in interest-bearing transaction accounts (NOW) and $6.4 million in money market accounts.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Time deposits declined by $4.1 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company has no brokered deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Total shareholders equity increased by $6.0 million from $36.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $42.5 million at December 31, 2015.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets .
1168455_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, up $2.0 million, or 10.1%, from $19.4 million for 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $37 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $20.8 million during 2015 and $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.37% for 2015 down from 5.52% for 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company benefited from a prepayment fee of approximately $0.2 million on a large commercial real estate loan which increased overall loan yield by approximately 5 basis points.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 14 basis points from 1.72% during 2014 to 1.86% during 2015 and an increase in average balance from $87.9 million in 2014 to $91.3 million in 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase in yield on investment securities includes an increase in municipal securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $174 thousand in 2015 and $137 thousand in 2014, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest expense on deposits increased by $2 thousand to $518 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $516 thousand in 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.36% during 2014 to 0.33% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	This decrease primarily relates to the maturity of higher rate time deposits.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	On April 15, 2013, to help fund the repurchase of preferred stock during 2013, the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The subordinated debt bears an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, has a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant (the Lender Warrant ) to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Company s common stock, no par value at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	On April 16, 2015 we paid off the subordinated debenture resulting in a reduction in interest expense related to this debt of $537 thousand from $756 thousand during 2014 to $219 thousand during 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	The effective yield on the debenture during 2015 was 10.2% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest expense on the Company s note payable (see Financial Condition Note Payable ) increased by $44 thousand to $155 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	This increase was related to an increase in average borrowings on this note from $2.3 million during the 2014 period to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	During April of 2015 we borrowed an additional $4 million on the note bringing the balance to $5 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	This $4 million along with a dividend from Plumas Bank to Plumas Bancorp were used to fund the payoff of the subordinated debenture.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	The average rate paid on the note payable was 4.02% during 2015 and 4.83% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	An increase of $1.7 million, or 8.7% in interest income, from $19.4 million during 2013 to $21.1 million during the current year, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $159 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $13 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $19.5 million during 2014 and $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.52% for 2014 down from 5.66% for 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area as well as an increase in lower yielding automobile loans as a percentage of total loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $353 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 32 basis points from 1.40% during 2013 to 1.72% during 2014 and an increase in average balance from $82.8 million in 2013 to $87.9 million in 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in yield on investment securities incudes an increase in government sponsored agency residential mortgage backed securities and municipal securities as a percentage of total securities and an increase in market yields.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest income on other interest-earning assets, which totaled $137 thousand in 2014 and $124 thousand in 2013, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.43% during 2013 to 0.36% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	This decrease primarily relates to a decline in market rates paid in the Company s service area and the maturity of higher rate time deposits.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Rates paid on NOW accounts declined by 2 basis points from 0.11% during 2013 to 0.09% during 2014.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P51_S7	The decline in rates paid on deposits is consistent with a decline in competitive market rates in our service area.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $243 thousand from $934 thousand during the twelve months ending December 31, 2013 to $1.2 million during 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	This increase was mostly related to an increase of $215 thousand in interest expense on the $7.5 million subordinated debenture which was only outstanding for 8.5 months during 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	The effective yield on the debenture during 2014 was 10.3% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of $318 thousand.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The largest component of this increase was an increase of $546 thousand in gains on the sale of government guaranteed SBA loans mostly related to an increase in the volume of loans originated and sold.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	During 2015, proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $29.4 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Other non-interest income increased by $54 thousand to $894 thousand mostly related to an increase of $126 thousand in dividends received on Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) stock.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	Of the $126 thousand, $88 thousand was a one-time special dividend paid by the FHLB during June 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	The effect of the increase in FHLB dividends and increases in other items of other non-interest income were partially offset by a $148 thousand gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	The largest decrease in non-interest income was $154 thousand in service charge income most of which was related to a reduction in NSF and overcharge income which we attribute to improved economic conditions as well as working with our customers to help them reduce NSF activity.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P63_S6	Additionally, gain on sale of investments declined by $107 thousand from $128 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 to $21 thousand during 2015.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	When other real estate is acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair market value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	The allowance is established through a provision for subsequent losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S4	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or from impairment are recorded as incurred.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S6	During the first three months of 2015 we recorded a net credit provision of $129 thousand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S7	The credit resulted from a significant increase in value of one OREO property based on a recent appraisal.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S8	This property was originally transferred to OREO at a value, net of estimated costs selling costs, of $1 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S9	Subsequently, based on declines in value it was written down to $0.7 million with a $0.3 million valuation allowance; however, recently the surrounding area in which the property is located has enjoyed significant new business activity and the value of this property has increased resulting in a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P70_S10	The $0.2 million was offset by declines in value on other OREO properties.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The decline in occupancy and equipment expense includes several reductions the largest of which was a savings of $49 thousand in equipment expense and maintenance.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is "more likely than not" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net loans increased by $30 million, or 8%, from $367 million at December 31, 2014 to $397 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The two largest areas of growth in the Company s loan portfolio were $28.8 million in commercial real estate loans and $5.6 million in commercial loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	Additionally, agricultural loans increased by $4.5 million and automobile loans increased $3.7 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	The largest decrease in any loan category was a decline of $8.4 million in construction and land development loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S5	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S6	These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P84_S7	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	As shown in the following table the Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and commercial loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Construction and land development loans represented 4.0% and 6.6% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 7% during the last two years reflects management s efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 73% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately 72% and 71%, respectively of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 39% and 42%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 12.1% of gross loans at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P92_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2015 and $35 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming assets.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	It consists of the Bank s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The MARC meets at least monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $473 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 down $693 thousand from $1.2 million during 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 0.33% during 2014 to 0.12% during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	Specific reserves related to impaired loans increased by $187 thousand from $564 thousand at December 31, 2014 to $751 thousand at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	General reserves were $5.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 1.47% at December 31, 2014 to 1.52% at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.35% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Loans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $2.0 million, $2.0 million, $4.5 million, $5.4 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 5 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 were $4.5 million, a decrease of $2.1 million from the $6.6 million balance at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $683 thousand at December 31, 2015 and $522 thousand at December 31, 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $2.1 million from $8.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $6.0 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased by $0.3 million from $4.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $4.1 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P122_S3	At December 31, 2015, $1.5 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P122_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $6.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $751 thousand and $564 thousand at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	Additionally, $0.7 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2015 is appropriate.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P124_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	OREO holdings represented seven properties totaling $1.8 million at December 31, 2015 and fifteen properties totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 1.06% at December 31, 2015 and 1.90% at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, dollars in thousands:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Investment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	Total investment securities were $96.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and $90.3 million as of December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company sold fifteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $12,260,000 recording a $21,000 net gain on sale.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S3	The investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 consisted of $74.3 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 83 municipal securities totaling $22.4 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company sold fourteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $16,325,000 recording a $128,000 gain on sale.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S5	The investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 consisted of $77.3 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, 52 municipal securities totaling $12.5 million and one corporate security totaling $0.5 million.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S6	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $47.6 million at December 31, 2015 and $22.9 million at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P127_S7	The balances, at December 31, 2015, earn interest at the rate of 0.5%.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	Total deposits increased by $59.4 million from $468 million at December 31, 2014 to $527 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	In addition to deposit growth from our branch network, we acquired approximately $10 million in deposits with our acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. effective July 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2015 as evidenced by increases in all major deposit categories with the exception of time.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S3	The two largest increases were $28.4 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits and $19.6 million in savings accounts.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S4	Time deposits declined by $4.1 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P133_S5	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	The following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2015 or 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2015:
1168455_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	Time deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company s local business and individual customer base.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P155_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P156_S1	No common cash dividends were paid during the last seven years.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P159_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S2	Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S3	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S4	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P160_S5	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P161_S1	Plumas Bancorp qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	The following table sets forth the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):
1168455_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	Management believes that Plumas Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P164_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $83.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $265 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S3	This compares to $89.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and no letters of credit at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S4	Of the $83.0 million in unfunded loan commitments, $46.1 million and $36.9 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2015, $42.6 million were secured by real estate, of which $16.0 million was secured by commercial real estate and $26.6 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P166_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	The Company leases two depository branches and three lending offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $233,000 and $192,000 during the years ended December, 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2016 and the last such lease expiring during 2020.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P168_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P168_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $154,000,000 from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $231,000,000.

1168455_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P171_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_16_ITEM7_P171_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	Cash held with other federally insured institutions in excess of FDIC limits as of December 31, 2015 was $9.8 million.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	Net cash flows are reported for customer loans and deposit transactions and repurchase agreements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Investment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	The term "other than temporary" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P32_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P33_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, FHLB stock totaled $2,380,000.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P33_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company had $2.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $86,589,000 and $76,797,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Servicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S2	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S3	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S4	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P38_S5	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company may not "carry over" or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 (the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans and credit card receivables.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, with the exception of automobile and other loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described on the next page.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Commercial Commercial loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Real estate Residential and H ome E quity L ines of C redit The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	R e al e state Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P78_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating .
1168455_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer and credit card loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P80_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DBO, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P80_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $200,000 and $141,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $1,756,000 ($3,106,000 less a valuation allowance of $1,350,000) at December 31, 2015 and $3,590,000 ($5,884,000 less a valuation allowance of $2,294,000) at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	Of these amounts $84,000 at December 31, 2015 and $146,000 at December 31, 2014 represent foreclosed residential real estate property.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	There was one consumer mortgage loans with a balance of $23 thousand secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S3	There were no consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S4	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $2,281,000, $3,399,000 and $2,404,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company recorded gains on sale of other real estate owned of $198,000, $101,000 and $171,000, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S6	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S7	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S8	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P83_S9	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are also recorded in other expenses as incurred.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over a period not to exceed fifteen years.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	There were no such events or circumstances during the periods presented.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, intangible assets totaled $94,000 and $0, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P88_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P98_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income plus discount on redemption of preferred stock less preferred dividends and accretion) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	The amount reclassified out of other accumulated comprehensive income relating to realized gains on securities available for sale was $21,000 and $128,000 for 2015 and 2014, with the related tax effect of $9,000 and $53,000, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	There were no sales of available for sale investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plans, net of related tax benefit, recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $70,000, $75,000 and $37,000 or $0.01, $0.02 and $0.01 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	During 2014 the Company granted options to purchase 110,400 shares of common stock.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	In January 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The objective of this guidance is to clarify when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, that is, when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan receivable should be derecognized and the real estate property recognized.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	ASU No. 2014-04 states that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	Additionally, ASU No. 2014-04 requires interim and annual disclosure of both (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 did not have a material impact on the Company s Financial Statements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Update improves the financial reporting of repurchase agreements and other similar transactions through a change in accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase financings, and the introduction of two new disclosure requirements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	New disclosures are required for (1) transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements, in which the transferor retains substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial asset throughout the term of the transaction and (2) repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings about the nature of collateral pledged and the time to maturity of those transactions The adoption of ASU No. 2014-11 did not have a material impact on the Company s Financial Statements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	This update to the ASC is the culmination of efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1168455_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	ASU 2014-09 supersedes Topic 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 describes a 5-step process entities can apply to achieve the core principle of revenue recognition and requires disclosures sufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and the significant judgments used in determining that information.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	This update was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein and requires expanded disclosures.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	In July 2015 the FASB issued a deferral of ASU 2014-09 of one year making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 while also providing for early adoption but not before the original effective date.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and disclosures, if any.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	Changes made to the current measurement model primarily affect the accounting for equity securities with readily determinable fair values, where changes in fair value will impact earnings instead of other comprehensive income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P116_S2	The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P116_S3	The Update also changes the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments including a requirement that public business entities use exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for disclosure purposes.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P116_S4	This Update is generally effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements and disclosures.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	The most significant change for lessees is the requirement under the new guidance to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases, which is generally defined as a lease term of less than 12 months.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	This change will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under current lease accounting guidance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	The amendments in this Update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P118_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and disclosures.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P124_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P126_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2015 are as follows:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2014 are as follows:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2).
1168455_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P134_S2	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	The fair value of the Company s Note Payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	Subordinated debentures and Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015 are summarized below:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 are summarized below:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P149_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2015 or 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P149_S3	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2015 are summarized below:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2014 are summarized below:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	Impaired Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or loans that have been subject to partial charge-offs are generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P155_S1	These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P155_S2	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P155_S3	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	Total losses of $47,000 and $125,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P157_S1	Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P157_S2	These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P158_S2	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P158_S3	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands) :
1168455_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	Net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $72,000 were recorded, net of $30,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company sold fifteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $12,260,000 recording a $21,000 net gain on sale.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	The Company realized a gain on sale from eight of these securities totaling $62,000 and a loss on sale on seven of these securities of $41,000.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $102,000 were recorded, net of $42,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity at December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company sold fourteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $16,325,000 recording a $128,000 gain on sale.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P215_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P218_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P219_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P220_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P220_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P220_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P221_S1	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 41% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P221_S2	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 47% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P221_S3	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P223_S1	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P223_S2	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P224_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P225_S2	The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P226_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $5,100,000.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P226_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 10 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ), pursuant to which the Bancorp issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Bancorp s common stock, no par value (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S1	Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Bancorp s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S2	The Company sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S3	The Company successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S4	This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P228_S5	The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	On June 27, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P229_S1	On October 25, 2013, Plumas Bancorp repurchased the remaining 3,133 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from a third party private investor.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P229_S2	The Company paid $3,101,670 plus accrued dividends of $30,453.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P229_S3	This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P229_S4	On May 22, 2013 the Bancorp repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P230_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P230_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options and warrants for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P231_S1	Stock options and warrants not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 53,000, 238,000 and 172,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P231_S2	At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 one stock warrant was outstanding to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	In 2001, the Company established a Stock Option Plan for which 192,893 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	As of December 31, 2015, all remaining shares in this plan have vested and no compensation cost remains unrecognized.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	The total fair value of options vested was $49,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P234_S1	The total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $240,000 and $51,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	In May 2013, the Company established the 2013 Stock Option Plan for which 500,000 shares of common stock are reserved and 396,800 shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2015.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S1	The 2013 Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash, with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months, in options of the Optionee that are fully vested and exercisable or in any combination of the foregoing.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S3	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S4	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P235_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2014,110,400 options were granted.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	As of December 31, 2015, there was $124,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested, share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2013 Plan.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	A summary of the activity within the 2013 Plan follows:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	Compensation cost related to stock options recognized in operating results under the two stock option plans was $70,000 and $81,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P238_S1	The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $7,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $88,000 and $34,000, respectively.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	The tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise totaled $13,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Bank is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P241_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P242_S0	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P242_S1	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S2	Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S3	The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S4	The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P243_S5	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	Plumas Bancorp qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	The following table sets forth the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):
1168455_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P246_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P246_S2	Management believes that the Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P250_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P251_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P251_S2	"More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P251_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	At December 31, 2015 total deferred tax assets were approximately $4,603,000 and total deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1,680,000 for a net deferred tax asset of $2,923,000.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P252_S1	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate timing differences in the tax deductibility of impairment charges on other real estate owned, deprecation on premises and equipment, the provision for loan losses and deferred compensation.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P252_S2	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is "more likely than not" that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P254_S1	The significant items comprising these differences consisted of the following:
1168455_16_ITEM8_P255_S0	At year-end 2015, the Company had state operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $62,000 which expire at various dates from 2029 to 2031.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P256_S0	Deferred tax assets are recognized for net operating losses because the benefit is more likely than not to be realized.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California jurisdictions.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	The Company conducts all of its business activities in the states of California and Nevada.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P258_S1	There are currently no pending U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2012, and by state and local taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2011.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P260_S0	The unrecognized tax benefits and changes therein and the interest and penalties accrued by the Company as of or during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not significant.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P260_S1	The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P261_S0	During the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties, including executive officers and directors.

1168455_16_ITEM8_P262_S2	Included under the Plan s investment options is the option to invest in Company stock.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P262_S3	During 2015, the Company s contribution consisted of a matching amount of 25% of the employee s contribution up to a total of 2% of the employee s compensation totaling $111,000.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P262_S4	No contribution was made for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1168455_16_ITEM8_P263_S0	Salary continuation and retirement agreements are in place for the Company s president and seven members of the Board of Directors as well as five former executives and four former directors.

1168455_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

1168455_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits.

1168455_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party ( Lender ) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.

1168455_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The subordinated debt had an interest rate of 7.5% per annum and a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of th e Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	In May of 2016 the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing the right to purchase 150,000 shares of the registrant s common stock at a cost of $862,000.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	The remaining warrant represents the right to purchase 150,000 shares of Plumas Bancorp common stock at an exercise price of $5.25 per share.

1168455_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Condition Note Payable for detail information related to these borrowing agreements.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank s assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	However, at December 31, 2016 approximately 72% of the Bank s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	In addi tion to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Currently, within towns in which the Bank has a branch there are 106 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 71 branches of 10 banks having assets in excess of $10 billion.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	As of June 30, 2016, the FDIC estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Greenville and Portola 100%, Chester 64%, Alturas 63%, Q uincy 53%, Fall River Mills 34%, Kings Beach 29%, Susanville 28%, Truckee 15%, Tahoe City 12%, Redding 1% and Reno less than 1%.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, mobile deposit and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiary employed 155 persons.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 142 persons.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	This Code of Ethics is available on the Company s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S4	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P52_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ).
1168455_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ).
1168455_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	As a California-chartered commercial bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the DBO and the FDIC, as well as certain of the regulations of the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).
1168455_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	The DBO and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S6	Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P61_S7	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	For additional information, see Item 7.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Standards.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	It is the Federal Reserve s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings support the organization s expected future needs and financial condition.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Further, it is the FRB s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are rest ricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $9.9 million.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the trust preferred securities issued by the Company s business trust subsidiaries.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	As of the most recent report of examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB s Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	In addition to supervising and regulating state chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	The Bank s FDIC insurance expense totaled $255 thousand for 2016 .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ( FICO ), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	The Bank s FICO assessments totaled $30 thousand for 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019 .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Under California law, the termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would result in a termination of the Bank s charter.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	Accordingly, banks may now enter new markets more freely.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following:
1168455_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally p rohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Fair Housing Act ( FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency cal led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	Smaller institutions, including the Bank, will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	Under the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act ( GLBA ) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S2	Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S3	The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S4	The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S5	The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P89_S6	Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Under federal law, the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FDIC for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, the payment of restitution and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P90_S2	The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P90_S3	The FRB has the authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management s plans.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P92_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Company s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company s earnings.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of New Accounting Standards of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	A deterioration of national or local economic conditions could reduce the Company s profitability.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Company s lending operations and its customers are primarily located in the eastern region of Northern California.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	A significant downturn in the national economy or the local economy due to agricultural commodity prices, real estate prices, public policy decisions, natural disaster, drought or other factors could result in a decline in the local economy in general, which could in turn negatively impact the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	The majority of the Company s assets are loans, which if not repaid would result in losses to the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Bank, like other lenders, is subject to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	Underwriting and documentation controls cannot mitigate all credit risk.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in the Company s market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers ability to repay.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S3	To the extent loans are not paid timely by borrowers, the loans are placed on non-accrual status, thereby reducing interest income.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S4	Further, under these circumstances, an additional provision for loan and lease losses or unfunded commitments may be required.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P100_S5	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	If the Company s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual loan losses, the Company s profitability could be reduced.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	The risk of loan losses is inherent in the lending business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon the Company s actual losses over a relevant time period and management s assessment of all relevant qualitative factors that may cause future loss experience to differ from its historical loss experience.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P102_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for determining the allowance for loan losses, it can give no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P102_S3	If the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses, or if bank regulatory agencies require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses, earnings could be significantly and adversely impacted.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	A deterioration in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 72% of the Company s total loan portfolio is secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	The Company s earnings depend largely upon net interest income, which is the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowed funds).
1168455_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	The interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities are affected principally by direct competition, and general economic conditions at the state and national level and other factors beyond the Company s control such as actions of the FRB, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and other state and federal economic policies.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for managing the impact of possible interest rate fluctuations on earnings, the Company can provide no assurance that its management efforts will prevent earnings from being significantly and adversely impacted by changes in interest rates.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	The Company could be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	Federal and state bank regulatory authorities require the Company and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P108_S1	The Company s ability to raise additional capital if and as needed depends on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside the Company s control, and on the Company s financial performance.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P108_S2	Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P108_S3	If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could be required to curtail its growth strategy or reduce the levels of assets owned.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P108_S4	In addition, although the Company and the Bank are currently well-capitalized under applicable regulatory frameworks, bank regulators are authorized and sometimes required to impose a wide range of requirements, conditions, and restrictions on banks and bank holding companies that fail to maintain adequate capital levels.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	D rought conditions in California could have an adverse impact on the Company s business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	In recent years, California has experienced a severe drought, though much of California has recently experienced significant rain during 2016 and the beginning of 2017.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	A significant portion of the Company s borrowers are involved in or are dependent on the agricultural industry in California, which requires water.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 11% of the Company s loans were categorized as agricultural loans.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	As a result of the drought, there have been governmental proposals concerning the distribution or rationing of water.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	If the amount of water available to agriculture becomes scarcer due to drought or rationing, growers may not be able to continue to produce agricultural products profitably, which could force some out of business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P112_S2	Although many of the Company s customers are not directly involved in agriculture, they could be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry because many jobs and businesses in the Company s market areas are related to the production of agricultural products.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P112_S3	Therefore, the drought could adversely impact the Company s loan portfolio, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	The Company faces substantial competition from larger banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	The Company faces subst antial competition for deposits and loans.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S2	Competition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations and other financial intermediaries.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S3	Larger competitors, by virtue of their larger capital resources, have substantially greater lending limits and marketing resources than the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S4	In addition, they have greater resources and may be able to offer longer maturities or lower rates.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S5	The Company s competitors may also provide certain services for their customers, including trust and international banking that the Company is only able to offer indirectly through correspondent relationships.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P114_S6	Ultimately, competition can reduce the Company s profitability, as well as make it more difficult to increase the size of its loan portfolio and deposit base.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	There are risks associated with the Company s growth strategy.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	During the past two years, the Company completed the purchase and assumption of a branch office in Redding, California, opened a branch office in Reno, Nevada and established loan production offices in Phoenix, Arizona, Seattle Washington and Klamath Falls Oregon.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P116_S1	The Company may engage in additional acquisition activity and open additional offices in the future to expand the Company s markets or further its growth strategy.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P116_S2	There is no assurance that future acquisitions or offices will be successful.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P116_S3	Further, growth may strain the Company s administrative, managerial, financial and operational resources and increase demands on its systems and controls.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P116_S4	If the Company pursues its growth strategy too aggressively, fails to attract qualified personnel, control costs or maintain asset quality, or if factors beyond management s control divert attention away from its business operations, the Company s pursuit of its growth strategy could have a material adverse impact on its existing business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	The Company relies on key executives and personnel and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse impact on the Company s prospects.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California community banking industry.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P118_S1	The process of recruiting personnel w ith the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company s strategies is often lengthy.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P118_S2	The Company s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, compliance and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of its management and personnel.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P118_S3	In particular, the Company s success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives and certain other employees.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	Security breaches and technological disruptions could damage the Company s reputation and profitability.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	The Company s business is highly reliant on third party vendors and its ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	The Company s electronic banking activities expose it to possible liability and loss of reputation should an unauthorized party gain access to confidential customer information.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P120_S1	Despite its considerable efforts and investment to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data, the Company cannot fully guarantee that these precautions will protect its systems from future compromises or breaches of its security measures.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P120_S2	Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test its security), failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect its ability to offer and grow its online services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact the Bank s reputation, and could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P120_S3	The Company may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company s business.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	Integral to the Company s performance is the continued efficacy of the Company s technology and information systems, operational infrastructure and relationships with third parties and its colleagues in its day-to-day and ongoing operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	Failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P122_S1	This includes, but is not limited to, operational or systems failures, disruption of client operations and activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as, the loss of key colleagues or failure on the part of key colleagues to perform properly.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	Additionally, the Company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties which may encounter t echnological or other difficulties that may significantly affect the Company s ability to process and account for customer transactions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	These vendors provide services that support its operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data, as well as its sales efforts.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	A cyber security breach of a vendor s system may result in theft of the Company s data or disruption of business processes.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	In most cases, the Company will remain primarily liable to its customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor s data security system.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	The Company relies on its outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	The loss of these vendor relationships could disrupt the services the Company provides to its customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintent ional violations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S0	The Company is subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S1	In the past, the Company s business has been increasingly affected by these regulations, and this trend is likely to continue into the future.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S2	Many of these laws are subject to interpretation and changing regulatory approaches to supervision and enforcement.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S3	The Company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S4	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S5	The Company may also suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations, that may also damage its reputation, and this in turn might materially affect its business and results of operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P127_S6	Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines, restitution or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports it files under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	The Company believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P130_S2	Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in its control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which could result in a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	The trading price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside its control.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P131_S1	Among the factors that could affect the Company s stock price are:
1168455_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	domestic and international economic factors unrelated to its performance.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	Significant decline in the Company s stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	The trading volume of the Company s common stock is limited.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	Although the Company s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, trading volume to date has been relatively modest.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P135_S1	The limited trading market for the Company s common stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies compared to more actively traded securities.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P135_S2	It may also make it more difficult for investors to sell the Company s common stock at desired prices, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number of shares of stock.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Company depends primarily on the operations of the Bank to repay its indebtedness and fund its operations .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P136_S1	The Company s ability to pay any dividends or repurchase any of its shares in the future will also depend on the success of the Bank s operations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	The Company is a separate and di stinct legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank, and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with, the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P137_S2	The Company s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	Disruptions in market conditions may adversely impact th e fair value of available-for-sale investment securities .
1168455_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) require the Company to carry its available-for-sale investment securities at fair value on its balance sheet.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P139_S1	Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost, net of its tax effect, are reported as a component of shareholders equity.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	In certain instances GAAP requires recognition through earnings of declines in the fair value of securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P140_S1	Changes in the fair value of these securities may result from a number of circumstances that are beyond the Company s control, such as changes in interest rates, the financial condition of government sponsored enterprises or insurers of municipal bonds, changes in demand for these securities as a result of economic conditions, or reduced market liquidity.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P140_S2	There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to loss recognition that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s net income and capital levels.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	Damage to the Company s reputation could significantly harm the Company s business and prospects.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	The Company s reputation is an important asset.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	The Company s relationship with many of its customers is predicated upon its reputation as a high quality provider of financial services that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	The Company s ability to attract and retain customers, investors and employees depends upon external perceptions.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P143_S1	Damage to its reputation among existing and potential customers, investors and employees could cause significant harm to the Company s business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, lending practices, inadequate protection of customer information, sales and marketing efforts, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P143_S2	Adverse developments in the banking industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company s reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P143_S3	The Company has policies and procedures in place that seek to protect its reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P143_S4	Negative publicity regarding the Company s business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors, and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	The markets in which the Company operates are subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	Most of the Company s offices are located in California.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	Also, most of the real and personal properties securing the Company s loans are located in California.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	California is prone to earthquakes, brush fires, flooding and other natural disasters.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	In addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties, if there is a major earthquake, brush fires, flood or other natural disaster, the Company faces the risk that many of the Company s borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.
1168455_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	Therefore, a major earthquake, brush fire, flood or other natural disaster in California could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Of the Company s twelve depository branches, ten are owned and two are leased.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company also leases five lending offices and owns four administrative facilities.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Non-branch administrative or credit administrative offices.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	Total rental expenses under all leases totaled $2 76,000, $233,000 and $192,000, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2017 and the last such lease expiring during 2021.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1168455_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Company maintains insurance coverage on its premises, leaseholds and equipment, including business interruption and record reconstruction coverage.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P4_S1	The branch properties and non-branch offices are adequate, suitable, in good condition and have adequate parking facilities for customers and employees.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company and Bank are limited in their investments in real property under Federal and state banking laws.
1168455_17_ITEM2_P5_S1	Generally, investments in real property are either for the Company and Bank use or are in real property and real property interests in the ordinary course of the Bank s business.

1168455_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents a summary of selected financial data and should be read in co njunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on inves tment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and gains from the sale of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significant ly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our most complex accounting po licies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We eval uate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstance s which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial conditio n, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company recorded net income of $ 7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.7 million or 29% over net income of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Pretax income increased by $2.7 million, or 28%, to $12.2 million in 2016 from $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net interest income increased by $2. 7 million to $24.1 million during 2016 from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $2.5 million and a decrease in interest expense of $181 thousand.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	An increase of $19 thousand in interest expense on deposits was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $200 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	The largest component of this decrease was a decrease of $219 thousand in interest expense related to the redemption of the Company s $7.5 million subordinated debenture in April, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	The provision for loan losses was $800 thousand during 2016 and $1.1 million during 2015 .

1168455_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	This increase included increases of $4.9 million in investment securities, $59.8 million in net loans ($60.2 million in gross loans), $0.3 million in bank owned life insurance and $0.7 million in other assets exclusive of OREO.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	These items were partially offset by decreases of $5.5 million in cash and due from banks, $0.5 million in premises and equipment and $1.0 million in OREO.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	L oan balances increased by $60.2 million, or 15%, from $401 million at December 31, 2015 to $461 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in loan balances includes $34.0 million in commercial real estate loans, $11.3 million in agricultural loans, $5.7 million in construction and land development loans , $5.2 million in automobile loans , $4.2 million in commercial loans and $4.0 million in equity lines of credits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decline of $4.2 million in residential real estate loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total deposits increased by $ 55.1 million from $527 million at December 31, 2015 to $582 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2016 as evidenced by increases of $27.7 million in demand deposits, $21.6 million in savings accounts, $8.4 million in money market accounts and $0.1 million in interest-bearing transaction accounts.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	Time deposits declined by $2.7 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company has no brokered deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Total shareholders equity increased by $5.5 million from $42.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $48.0 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The $5.5 million increase was related to earnings during 2016 of $7.5 million and an increase of $305 thousand representing stock option activity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	These items were partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on investment securities of $930 thousand, a $0.10 per share cash dividend totaling $489 thousand and the repurchase of a portion of a warrant, in May of 2016, representing the right to purchase 150,000 shares of the registrant s common stock at a cost of $862 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	(See Financial Condition Subordinated Debentures ) .

1168455_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and sharehold ers equity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Average balances are based on average daily balances.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:
1168455_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	201 6 compared to 201 5 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, up $2.7 million, or 12.5%, from $21.4 million for 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The $2.7 million included an increase of $2.5 million, or 11.0% in interest income, from $22.6 million during 2015 to $25.1 million during the current year and a decrease of $181 thousand in interest expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $2.2 million, interest on investment securities increased by $204 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $100 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $ 22.9 million during 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The average loan balances were $428.4 million for 2016, up $42.3 million from the $386.1 million for 2015.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.3 5% for 2016 down slightly from 5.37% for 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area for commercial real estate loans mostly offset by the 25 basis point increase in the prime rate on December 17, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $ 204 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 4 basis points from 1.86% during 2015 to 1.90% during 2016 and an increase in average balance from $91.3 million in 2015 to $99.7 million in 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $274 thousand in 2016 and $174 thousand in 2015, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The $100 thousand increase in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to an increase in yield of 23 basis points from 39 basis points in 2015 to 62 basis points in 2016 and is consistent with the increase in the average fed funds rate during these periods.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest expense on dep osits increased by $19 thousand to $537 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, up from $518 thousand in 2015.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.33% during 2015 to 0.31% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	This decrease primarily relates to the maturity of higher rate time deposits.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P40_S6	Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $26 thousand as we continued to experience strong growth in this category of deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P40_S7	Average savings deposits increased by $14.2 million from $119.1 million during 2015 to $133.3 million during 2016.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $ 200 thousand from $686 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $486 thousand during the current twelve month period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	On April 15, 2013, to help fund the repurchase of preferred stock during 2013, the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	On April 16, 2015 we paid off the subordinated debenture resulting in a reduction in interest expense related to this debt of $219 thousand .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Interest e xpense on the Company s note payable (see Financial Condition Note Payable ) decreased by $22 thousand to $133 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	This decrease was related to a decrease in average borrowings on this note from $3.9 million during the 2015 period to $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The average rate paid on the note payable was 4.04% during 2016 and 4.02% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $42 thousand to $348 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
1168455_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Interest on other borrowings, which mostly relates to repurchase agreements, totaled $5 thousand in 2016 and $6 thousand in 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 201 6 increased to 4.21%, from 4.10% during 2015 .

1168455_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The $2.0 million included an increase of $1.5 million, or 6.9% in interest income, from $21.1 million during 2014 to $22.6 million during the current year and a decrease of $489 thousand in interest expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Interest and fees on loans increased by $1.3 million, interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand and intere st on deposits increased by $37 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances partially offset by a decline in yield.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Interest on investments securities benefited from both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $20.8 million during 2015 and $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.37% for 2015 down from 5.52% for 2014.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company benefited from a prepayment fee of approximately $0.2 million on a large commercial real estate loan which increased overall loan yield by approximately 5 basis points.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Interest on investment securities increased by $179 thousand as a result of an increase in yield of 14 basis points from 1.72% during 2014 to 1.86% during 2015 and an increase in average balance from $87.9 million in 2014 to $91.3 million in 2015.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	We attribute much of this decline to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P52_S4	The average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.36% during 2014 to 0.33% during the current twelve month period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P52_S5	This decrease primarily relates to the maturity of higher rate time deposits.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	The reduction in interest expense was related to payoff of the subordinated debenture with interest on this debt declining by $537 thousand from $756 thousand during 2014 to $219 thousand during 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	The effective yield on the debenture during 2015 was 10.2% which was in excess of the 7.5% rate due to amortization of a $75 thousand commitment fee and a discount recorded on issuance of a warrant in the amount of $318 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Interest expense on the Company s note payable increased by $44 thousand to $155 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	This increase was related to an increase in average borrowings on this note from $2.3 million during the 2014 period to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	During April of 2015 we borrowed an additional $4 million on the note bringing the balance to $5 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	This $4 million along with a dividend from Plumas Bank to Plumas Bancorp were used to fund the payoff of the subordinated debenture.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	The average rate paid on the note payable was 4.02% during 2015 and 4.83% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $3 thousand to $306 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3- month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

1168455_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Based o n information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	201 6 compared to 201 5 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Increases in service charge income of $77 thousand and loan servicing fees of $80 thousand were offset by a $172 thousand decline in gain on sale of loans and an $53 thousand decline in gain on sale of investments.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	The increase in service charge income mostly relates to an increase in interchange fees on debit card transactions.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Loan servicing income represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of small business administration ( SBA ) loans sold into the secondary market.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	At December 31, 2016 we were servicing over $96 million in guaranteed portions of loans an increase of $10 million from over $86 million at December 31, 2015.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	During 2015 we sold $26.5 million in guaranteed portions of SBA loans recording a gain of sale $1.9 million .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	We attribute the decline in gain on sale of SBA loans to a decline in the average of the rate paid on loans sold as well as a reduction in SBA loan sale premiums related to market conditions.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P66_S5	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 we sold fourteen investment securities recording a net loss of $32 thousand.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 non-interest income totaled $7.7 million an increase of $400 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2014.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	The largest component of this increase was an increase of $546 thousand in gains on the sale of government guaranteed SBA loans mostly related to an increase in the volume of loans originated and sold.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	During 2015, proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $29.4 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	This compares to proceeds of $21.6 million and a gain on sale of $1.4 million during 2014.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Loan servicing income, which increased by $60 thousand, represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of loans sold into the secondary market.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	Other non-interest income increased by $54 thousand to $894 thousand mostly related to an increase of $126 thousand in dividends received on FHLB stock.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	Of the $126 thousand, $88 thousand was a one-time special dividend paid by the FHLB during June 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S4	The effect of the increase in FHLB dividends and increases in other items of other non-interest income were partially offset by a $148 thousand gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2014.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S5	The largest decrease in non-interest income was $154 thousand in service charge income most of which was related to a reduction in NSF and overcharge income which we attribute to improved economic conditions as well as working with our customers to help them reduce NSF activity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P68_S6	Additionally, gain on sale of investments declined by $107 thousand from $128 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 to $21 thousand during 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 .

1168455_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	The largest declines in non-interest expense were $216 thousand in OREO expenses, $99 thousand in professional fees and $77 thousand in deposit insurance expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The largest category of non-interest expense is salary and benefits expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The two largest increases in this category were $ 247 thousand in salary expense and $225 thousand in bonus expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	Other increases in salary and benefit include $93 thousand in commissions related to SBA lending activity and $51 thousand in accrued vacation expense.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	Bonus expense increased from $600 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to $825 thousand during the current period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	Offsetting the increase in salary and bonus expense was an increase of $545 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs related to an increase in loan production.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2015 we sold 12 OREO properties for total proceeds of $2.1 million recording a net gain on sale of $198 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S6	This compares to net proceeds of $2.2 million on the sale of 6 properties and a net gain on sale of $60 thousand during 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S7	The largest component of the increase in outside service fees is $37 thousand in costs associated with the outsourcing of our email processing beginning in February, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S8	Of the $74 thousand increase in telephone and data communications $33 thousand relates to our Reno Nevada branch which opened in December, 2015 while the remainder is primarily related to an upgrade in our data communication network.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S9	The increase in occupancy and equipment costs and advertising and promotion expense also relate to the Reno branch.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P71_S10	We have developed an aggressive marketing plan for Reno branch which includes print and radio advertising as well as various efforts to reach out to the community.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	OREO costs which declined from $1 82 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to credit of $34 thousand during 2016 benefited from a reduction in OREO properties, a reimbursement of previously incurred costs and $86 thousand in rental income on a new OREO property.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The OREO property that produced the rental income was sold during December, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	The decrease in professional fees is mostly related to a decline in legal expense related to loan collection activities as our two largest collection cases were resolved in 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	One case resulted in a loan loss recovery of $360 thousand while the other case resulted in foreclosure on a commercial property which was sold in December, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Non-interest expense increased by $646 thousand to $18.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $17.8 million during 2014.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The increase in salary and benefits includes an increase in salary expense, exclusive of commissions, of $412 thousand mostly related to merit and promotion increases, new hire s including three loan officers; one serving Reno, Nevada, one located in Chico, California and an SBA loan officer in Arizona, and a branch manager for our new Reno, Nevada location.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Other significant increases in salary and benefit expense include an increase of $147 thousand in commission expense, $111 thousand in 401k plan contributions and a reduction of $104 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	The increase in commission expense is mostly related to an increase in SBA activity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	Effective January 1, 2015, we reestablished a 401k matching benefit resulting in $111 thousand in matching contributions.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	During each of 2015 and 2014 the Company s bonus expense totaled $600 thousand, the maximum payable under the terms of the respective bonus plans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The largest component of the increase in professional fees was an increase of $79 thousand in legal fees related to loan collection activities and general corporate matters including costs associated with our Redding branch acquisition and our Reno, Nevada branch.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The second largest increase in professional fees was an increase of $52 thousand in audit expense related to lending functions, including the cost of our semi-annual loan review, an annual review of our SBA loan operations by the SBA and a review of our loan compliance systems.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Insurance expense, during 2014, benefited from a one-time adjustment to accrued life insurance costs.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The decline in OREO costs includes a decrease in OREO legal expense of $125 thousand and a decline in repair and maintenance costs of $54 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	During 2014 we incurred $142 thousand in legal costs, related to OREO, pursuing additional recoveries on selected OREO properties through legal channels.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	In addition, OREO repair expense during 2014 totaled $93 thousand much of which was used to fix up several properties in an effort to increase their marketability.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	OREO repair costs were $62 thousand in 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	OREO maintenance costs declined by $23 thousand related to a decline in OREO properties.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	The provision from cha nge in OREO valuation declined by $161 thousand from $240 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $79 thousand during the current period.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	During the first three months of 2015 we recorded a net credit provision of $129 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	The credit resulted from a significant increase in value of one OREO property based on a recent appraisal.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	This property was originally transferred to OREO at a value, net of estimated selling costs, of $1 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	Subsequently, based on declines in value it was written down to $0.7 million with a $0.3 million valuation allowance; however, recently the surrounding area in which the property is located has enjoyed significant new business activity and the value of this property has increased resulting in a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	The $0.2 million was offset by declines in value on other OREO properties.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The decline in occupancy and equipment expense includes several reductions the largest of which was a savings of $49 thousand in equip ment expense and maintenance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	During 2014 equipment expense was high as we chose to replace all of our personal computers running Windows XP with machines running Windows 7.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $4.8 million, or 38.9% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	During 2015 the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.7 million, or 39.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	The percentages for 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and interest on qualified municipal securities.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Loans increased by $60.2 million, or 15%, from $401 million at December 31, 2015 to $461 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase in loan balances includes $34.0 million in commercial real estate loans, $11.3 million in agricultural loans, $5.7 million in construction and land development loans, $5.2 million in automobile loans, $4.2 million in commercial loans, and $4.0 million in equity lines of credit.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decline of $4.2 million in residential real estate loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	In 2016 we hired a new agricultural/commercial loan officer located in Klamath Falls, Oregon.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	The increase in agricultural loans during 2016 is largely related to his efforts.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	Loan growth also benefited from the opening of our branch in Reno, Nevada during December, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S6	Loan growth related to this branch exceeded $11 million in 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S7	The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S8	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S9	These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P82_S10	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	As shown in the follow ing table the Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and commercial loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Construction and land development loans represented 4. 7% and 4.0% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 5% during the last two years reflects management s efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 72% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, and Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 74% and 72%, respectively of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 42% and 39%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 11.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $51 million at December 31, 2016 and $40 million at December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S4	In 2016 we hired a new agricultural/commercial loan officer located in Klamath Falls, Oregon.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P90_S5	The increase in agricultural loans during 2016 is mostly attributable to his efforts.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 201 6.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming assets.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	It consists of the Bank s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	The MARC meets at least quarterly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on -going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the main tenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for lo an losses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying los s factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	T he following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	During each of the years ended December 31, 201 6 and 2015 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $800 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $329 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016 down $144 thousand from $473 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from 0.12% during 2015 to 0.08% during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:
1168455_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	The allowance for loan losses totaled $6. 5 million at December 31, 2016 and $6.1 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $385 thousand from $751 thousand at December 31, 2015 to $366 thousand at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	General reserves were $6.2 million at December 31, 2016 and $5.3 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.52% at December 31, 2015 to 1.42% at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P109_S3	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.36% at December 31, 2016 and 1.35% at December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restru cturing (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Loans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $2.6 million, $2.0 million, $2.0 million, $4.5 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 5 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 201 6 were $2.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the $4.5 million balance at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $298 thousand at December 31, 2016 and $683 thousand at December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $2.0 million at December 31, 2016 and $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $2.6 million from $6.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $3.4 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	Loans classified as watch decreased by $2.9 million from $4.1 million at December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	At December 31, 2016, $0.4 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P119_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	At December 31, 201 6 and December 31, 2015, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $5.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $366 thousand and $751 thousand at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	Additionally, $0.7 million has been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2016 and December 31 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2016 is appropriate.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P121_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P121_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial a ssets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	OREO holdings represented six properties totaling $735 thousand at December 31, 2016 and seven properties totaling $1.8 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P122_S3	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.53% at December 31, 2016 and 1.06% at December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 201 6 and 2015, dollars in thousands:

1168455_17_ITEM7_P124_S8	There were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $32.4 million at December 31, 2016 and $47.6 million at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P124_S9	The balances, at December 31, 2016, earn interest at the rate of 0.75%.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	Se curities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the C ompany s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Total deposits increased by $55.1 million from $527 million at December 31, 2015 to $582 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2016 as evidenced by increases of $27.7 million in demand deposits, $21.6 million in savings accounts, $8.4 million in money market accounts and $0.1 million in interest bearing transaction accounts.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P130_S2	Time deposits declined by $2.7 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P130_S3	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following t able shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable , long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P136_S4	To borrow the $172 million in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2.2 million in additional FHLB stock.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P136_S5	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	In 2011 the Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	The balance in this product at December 31, 2016 was $7.6 million, a decrease of $124 thousand from the December 31, 2015 balance of $7.7 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	On April 15, 2013 the Company issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture ( subordinated debt ).
1168455_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P144_S2	On April 16, 2015 the Company paid off the subordinated debt.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P144_S3	Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $219,000.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	In May of 2016 the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing the right to purchase 150,000 shares of the registrant s common stock at a cost of $862 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	The remaining warrant represents the right to purchase 150,000 shares of Plumas Bancorp common stock at an exercise price of $5.25 per share.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are business trust subsidiaries formed by the Company with capital of $319,000 and $166,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P147_S3	The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	Trust I s Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 4.40% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P148_S3	The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P148_S4	Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Interest expense recognized by the C ompany for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 related to the subordinated debentures was $348,000, $306,000 and $3 03,000, respectively.

1168455_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	The $5.5 million increase was related to earnings during 2016 of $7.5 million and an increase of $305 thousand representing stock option activity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	These items were partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on investment securities of $930 thousand, a $0.10 per share cash dividend totaling $489 thousand and the repurchase of a portion of a warrant, in May of 2016, representing the right to purchase 150,000 shares of the registrant s common stock at a cost of $862 thousand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P151_S1	Such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhanc ing the marketability of the Company s stock.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, reviews the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P153_S1	The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	On October 20, 2016 the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	The dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share was paid on November 21, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business day on November 7, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S6	Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P157_S7	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( th e Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	Plumas Bancorp qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	The following table sets forth the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):
1168455_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	Management believes that Plumas Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $93.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and $625 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S3	This compares to $83.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $265 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S4	Of the $93.7 million in unfunded loan commitments, $52.9 million and $40.8 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2016, $51.4 million were secured by real estate, of which $20.9 million was secured by commercial real estate and $30.5 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P163_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company leases two depository branches and five lending offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $276,000 and $233,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	The increase in rental expense in 2016 mostly relates to the rental of our Redding, California Branch.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P164_S3	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2017 and the last such lease expiring during 2021.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and m aintain reserve requirements.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P165_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P165_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	The Company is a member of th e FHLB and can borrow up to $172 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $270 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P166_S3	There were no outstanding borrowings under the FHLB or the correspondent bank borrowing lines at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	Customer deposits are the Company s primary source of funds.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	Total deposits increased by $55.1 million from $527 million at December 31, 2015 to $582 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P168_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_17_ITEM7_P168_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.
1168455_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The following consolidated financial statements of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary, and report of the independent registered public accounting firm are included in the Annual Report of Plumas Bancorp to its shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

1168455_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Stat es).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plumas Bancorp and Subsidiary as of December 31, 201 6 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1168455_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation, expansion and diversification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I ( Trust I ) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002.

1168455_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Bank s administrative headquarters is in Quincy, California.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	In addition, the Bank operates lending offices specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California, Phoenix, Arizona and Seattle, Washington and commercial/agricultural lending offices in Chico, California and Klamath Falls, Oregon.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Bank s primary source of revenue is generated from providing loans to customers who are predominately small and middle market businesses and individuals residing in the surrounding areas.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsi diary, Plumas Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Plumas Statutory Trust I and Trust II are not consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company s investment in Trust I of $319,000 and Trust II of $166,000 are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued and guaranteed by the Company and held by Trust I and Trust II are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances to conform to the classifications used in 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	These reclassifications had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or net change in cash and cash equivalents.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	These e stimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.

1168455_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Investments are classified into one of the following categories:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss ) within shareholders equity.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	As of December 31, 201 6 and 2015 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circum stances.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	As of December 31, 201 6 and 2015 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Investment securities that are im paired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P28_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held $2,438,000 and $2,380,000, respectively of FHLB stock .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Busines s Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	As of December 31, 201 6 and 2015 the Company had $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $ 96,592,000 and $86,589,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company accounts for the transf er and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Se rvicing rights acquired through 1) a purchase or 2) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Servicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S4	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P34_S5	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the time of sale.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the c ontractual term of the loan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist between the contractual c ash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cas h flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Co mpany may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	A loan is considered impaired when, based on current info rmation and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	A restructuring of a debt consti tutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The determination of the general r eserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 (the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	These portfolio segments incl ude commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans and credit card receivables.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, with the exception of automobile and other loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all such loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall col lectability of the portfolio.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped in to five major categories, defined as follows:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Pass A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Watch A Watch loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consi sts of reserve factors that are based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) historical losses and (2) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described on the next page.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Commercial Commercial loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Real estate Residential and Home Equity Lines of Credit The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P74_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer and credit card loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors a nd management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DBO, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P76_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Management estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $200,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligation s, which was $735,000 ($2 ,005,000 less a valuation allowance of $1,270,000) at December 31, 2016 and $1,756,000 ($3,106,000 less a valuation allowance of $1,350,000) at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Of these amounts $84,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 represent foreclosed residential real estate property.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	There were four consumer mortgage loans with a balance of $335 thousand secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	There was one consumer mortgage loans with a balance of $23 thousand secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $2,245,000, $2,281,000 and $3,399,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Company recorded gains on sale of other real estate owned of $60,000, $198,000 and $1 01,000, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S6	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S7	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S8	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P79_S9	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are also recorded in other expenses as incurred.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over a period not to exceed fifteen years.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	There were no such events or circumstances during the periods presented.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, intangible assets totaled $87,000 and $94,000, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in de ferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P94_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P94_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income plus discount on redemption of preferred stock less preferred dividends and accretion) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P96_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	The amount reclassif ied out of other accumulated comprehensive income relating to realized (losses) gains on securities available for sale was $(32,000) , $21,000 and $128,000 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, with the related tax effect of $(13,000), $9,000 and $53,000, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P99_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	Compensation expense related to the Com pany s Stock Option Plans, net of related tax benefit, recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $103,000, $70,000 and $75,000 or $0.02, $0.01 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P101_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company also makes assumptions regarding estimated forfeitures that will impact the total compensation expenses recognized under the Plans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	During 2016 and 2014 the Company granted options to purchase 108,000 and 110,400 shares of common stock, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	This update to the ASC is the culmination of efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	ASU 2014-09 supersedes Topic 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 describes a 5-step process entities can apply to achieve the core principle of revenue recognition and requires disclosures sufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and the significant judgments used in determining that information.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	This update was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein and requires expanded disclosures.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	In July 2015 the FASB issued a deferral of ASU 2014-09 of one year making it effecti ve for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 while also providing for early adoption but not before the original effective date.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	Since the guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other GAAP, the Company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on revenue most closely associated with financial instruments, including interest income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P107_S3	The Company is currently performing an overall assessment of revenue streams potentially affected by the ASU including deposit related fees and interchange fees to determine the potential impact the new guidance is expected to have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P107_S4	The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective approach.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	Changes made to the current measurement model primarily affect the accounting for equity securities with readily determinable fair values, where changes in fair value will impact earnings instead of other comprehensive income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P108_S3	The Update also changes the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments including a requirement that public business entities use exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for disclosure purposes.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P108_S4	This Update is generally effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company will continue to closely monitor developments and additional guidance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	The most significant change for lessees is the requirement under the new guidance to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases, which is generally defined as a lease term of less than 12 months.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	This change will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under current lease accounting guidance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P110_S3	ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company has several lease agreements, including two branch locations, which are currently considered operating leases, and therefore, not recognized on the Company s consolidated statements of condition.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	The Company expects the new guidance will require some of these lease agreements to now be recognized on the consolidated statements of condition as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	Therefore, the Company s preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 are expected to impact the Company s consolidated statements of condition.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P111_S3	However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of potential impact the new guidance will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	On March 30, 2016, the F ASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P112_S1	ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 and elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P112_S3	The cumulative effect adjustment from the modified retrospective transition of the forfeitures and the classification of awards did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements or disclosures.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company expects adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 could result in increased volatility to reported income tax expense related to excess tax benefits and tax.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	The standard will replace today s incurred loss approach with an expected loss model.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S3	The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S4	This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S5	The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S6	For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S7	The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S8	ASU No. 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P114_S9	ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Company has begun its implementation efforts by establishing an implementation team chaired by the Company s Chief Lending Officer and composed of members of the Company s credit administration and accounting departments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	The Company s preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of the potential impact.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Mana gement monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2016 are as follows:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2015 are as follows:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipat ed future business related to the instruments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 201 6 are summarized below:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015 are summarized below:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	The fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for simil ar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P148_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2016 or 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	Changes in fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2016 are summarized below:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2015 are summarized below:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company has no liabilities which are reported at fair value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans : The Bank does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P155_S1	However, from time to time, fair value adjustments are recorded on these loans to reflect partial write-downs, through charge-offs or specific reserve allowances, that are based on fair value estimates of the underlying collateral.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P155_S2	The fair value estimates for collateral-dependent impaired loans are generally based on recent real estate appraisals or broker opinions, obtained from independent third parties, which are frequently adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and estimated selling costs (Level 3).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P155_S3	Total losses of $75,000 and $47,000 represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P156_S1	In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property which are commonly adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and selling costs (Level 3).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P158_S2	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P158_S3	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1168455_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	U nrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $1,654,000 were recorded, net of $682,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity at December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company sold fourteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $14,589,000 recording a $32,000 loss on sale.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	The Company realized a gain on sale from eight of these securities totaling $48,000 and a loss on sale on six securities of $80,000.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	U nrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $72,000 were recorded, net of $30,000 in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity at December 31, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company sold fifteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $12,260,000 recording a $21,000 net gain on sale.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P162_S2	The Company realized a gain on sale from eight of these securities totaling $62,000 and a loss on sale on seven of these securities of $41,000.

1168455_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P219_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	At December 31, 201 6 , consumer loan commitments represent approximately 11% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 37% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P220_S2	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 52% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P220_S3	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Sha sta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P222_S2	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P223_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such ac tions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P224_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P224_S2	The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of th e Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P225_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $9 ,900,000.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P225_S2	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the business trusts (see Note 10 for additional information related to the Trust Preferred Securities).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	On October 20, 2016 the Co mpany announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	The dividend, in the amount of $0.10 per share, was paid on November 21, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business day on November 7, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P227_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options and warrants for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	Stock options a nd warrants not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 63,000, 53,000 and 238,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P228_S2	At December 31, 2016 one stock warrant was outstanding to purchase up to 150,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P228_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 one stock warrant was outstanding to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	In 2001, the Company established a Sto ck Option Plan for which 81,893 shares of common stock remain reserved for issuance to employees and directors and no shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2016 .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	As of December 31, 201 6, all remaining shares in this plan have vested and no compensation cost remains unrecognized.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	The total fair value of options vested was $0 and $49,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P231_S1	The total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $427,000 and $240,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	In May 2013, the Company established the 2013 Stock Option Plan for which 489,443 shares of common stock are reserved and 298,400 shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2016.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S1	The 2013 Plan requires that the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the stock must be paid in full at the time the option is exercised.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S2	Payment in full for the option price must be made in cash, with Company common stock previously acquired by the optionee and held by the optionee for a period of at least six months, in options of the Optionee that are fully vested and exercisable or in any combination of the foregoing.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S3	The options expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 108,000 and 110,400 options were granted, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P232_S5	No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	As of December 31, 201 6, there was $282,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested, share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2013 Plan.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P233_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P234_S0	A summary of the activity within the 2013 Plan follows:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	Compensation cost related to stock options recognized in operating results under the two stock option plans was $116,000, $70,000 and $81,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $13,000 , $7,000 , $6,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P236_S0	Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 201 6, 2015 and 2014 was $200 ,000, $88,000 and $34,000, respectively.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P236_S1	The tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise totaled $12,000, $13,000 and $13,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P237_S0	Th e Bank is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P237_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P238_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P238_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P238_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framewo rk for prompt corrective action.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P239_S1	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S6	Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P240_S7	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P241_S1	Plumas Bancorp qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P242_S0	T he following table sets forth the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):
1168455_17_ITEM8_P243_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P243_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P243_S2	Management believes that the Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P244_S0	Other expenses consisted of the following:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P245_S0	The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 201 6, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P246_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P247_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P247_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expect ed to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P248_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P248_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P248_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P248_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P249_S0	At December 31, 201 6 total deferred tax assets were approximately $6,101,000 and total deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1,866,000 for a net deferred tax asset of $4,235,000.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate timing differences in the tax deductibility of impairment charges on other real estate owned, deprecation on premises and equipment, the provision for loan losses and deferred compensation.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P249_S2	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P251_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P251_S1	The significant items comprising these differences consisted of the following:
1168455_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and applicable state jurisdictions.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P253_S0	The Company conducts all of its business activities in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P253_S1	There are currently no pending U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P254_S0	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 20 13, and by state and local taxing authorities for years ended before December 31, 2012.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P255_S0	The unrecognized tax benefits and changes therein and the interest and penalties accrued by the Company as of or during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P255_S1	The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
1168455_17_ITEM8_P256_S0	During the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties, including executive officers and directors.

1168455_18_ITEM1_P43_S4	In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires, drought and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, Internet-based lending platforms and investment banking firms.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990 s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Currently, within towns in which the Bank has a branch there are 107 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 7 0 branches of 10 banks having assets in excess of $10 billion.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	As of June 30, 2017, the FDIC estimated the Bank s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Greenville and Portola 100%, Quincy 87%, Chester 66% , Alturas 59%, Fall River Mills 34%, Kings Beach 33%, Susanville 30%, Truckee 17%, Tahoe City 13%, Redding 1% and Reno less than 1%.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, mobile deposit and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	At December 31, 2017, the Company and its subsidiary employed 161 persons.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 142 persons.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	This Code of Ethics is available on the Company s website at www.plumasbank.com.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	As financial institution, we are extensively regulated under federal and state law.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S4	Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P54_S5	We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ).
1168455_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ).
1168455_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	As a California-chartered commercial bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the DBO and the FDIC, as well as certain of the regulations of the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).
1168455_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	The DBO and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P61_S4	The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S6	When fully phased in and including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the new capital rules would result in the following minimum ratios for the Bank to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P62_S7	The new capital rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Under t he new capital rules, the minimum capital ratios (including the applicable increment of the capital conservation buffer) as of January 1, 2017 were as follows: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.75%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.25%; a total capital risk-based capital ratio of 9.25% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	As of January 1, 2018, the required minimum ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital will increase by the capital conservation buffer increment of 0.625%, to 6.375%, 7.875% and 9.875% respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company and any other company deemed to control the bank must guarantee the performance of that plan.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S4	Under current regulations, a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P65_S5	At December 31, 2017, the Bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	The FRB has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) (the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	For additional information, see Item 7.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Standards.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	It is the Federal Reserve s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings support the organization s expected future needs and financial condition.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	Further, it is the FRB s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	In addition the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the trust preferred securities issued by the Company s business trust subsidiaries.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the Bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approv al of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $11.3 million.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Under California law, the Bank s ability to make aggregate secured and unsecured loans-to-one-borrower is limited to 25% and 15%, respectively, of unimpaired capital and surplus.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	At December 31, 2017, the Bank s limit on aggregate secured loans-to-one-borrower was $17.9 million and unsecured loans-to-one borrower was $10.7 million.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P74_S2	The Bank has established internal loan limits that are lower than the legal lending limits for a California bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	A less than Satisfactory rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P75_S3	As of the most recent report of examination the Bank s CRA rating was Satisfactory.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P76_S3	A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB s Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P78_S3	Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	In addition to supervising and regulating state chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	The Bank s FDIC insurance expense totaled $255 thousand for 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a ssessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ( FICO ), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	The Bank s FICO assessments totaled $30 thousand for 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019 .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	Under California law, the termination of the Bank s deposit insurance would result in a termination of the Bank s charter.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	Accordingly, banks may now enter new markets more freely.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following:
1168455_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, nat ional origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from steering consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Fair Housing Act ( FH Act ) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Right to Financial Privacy Act imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as a new, independent federal agency.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	Smaller institutions, including the Bank, are generally subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	Under the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act ( GLBA ) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S3	The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S4	The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S5	The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P96_S6	Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Under federal law, the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FDIC for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, the payment of restitution and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P97_S3	The FRB has the authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P98_S2	Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management s plans.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P98_S3	No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Company s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company s earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P100_S2	These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of New Accounting Standards of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	A deterioration of national or local economic conditions could reduce the Company s profitability.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Company s lending operations and its customers are primarily located in the eastern region of Northern California.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	A significant downturn in the national economy or the local economy due to agricultural commodity prices, real estate prices, public policy decisions, natural disaster, drought or other factors could result in a decline in the local economy in general, which could in turn negatively impact the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	The majority of the Company s assets are loans, which if not repaid would result in losses to the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	The Bank, like other lenders, is subject to credit risk, which is t he risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S1	Underwriting and documentation controls cannot mitigate all credit risk.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S2	A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in the Company s market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers ability to repay.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S3	To the extent loans are not paid timely by borrowers, the loans are placed on non-accrual status, thereby reducing interest income.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S4	Further, under these circumstances, an additional provision for loan and lease losses or unfunded commitments may be required.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P107_S5	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	If the Company s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual loan losses, the Company s profitability could be reduced.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	The risk of loan losses is inherent in the lending business.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon the Company s actual losses over a relevant time period and management s assessment of all relevant qualitative factors that may cause future loss experience to differ from its historical loss experience.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P109_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for determining the allowance for loan losses, it can give no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P109_S3	If the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses, or if bank regulatory agencies require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses, earnings could be significantly and adversely impacted.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	A deterioration in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 72% of the Company s total loan portfolio is secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	The Company s earnings depend largely upon net interest income, which is the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowed funds).
1168455_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	The interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities are affected principally by direct competition, and general economic conditions at the state and national level and other factors beyond the Company s control such as actions of the FRB, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and other state and federal economic policies.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P113_S2	Although the Company maintains a rigorous process for managing the impact of possible interest rate fluctuations on earnings, the Company can provide no assurance that its management efforts will prevent earnings from being significantly and adversely impacted by changes in interest rates.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	The Company could be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	Federal and state bank regulatory authorities require the Company and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P115_S1	The Company s ability to raise additional capital if and as needed depends on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside the Company s control, and on the Company s financial performance.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P115_S2	Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P115_S3	If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could be required to curtail its growth strategy or reduce the levels of assets owned.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P115_S4	In addition, although the Company and the Bank are currently well-capitalized under applicable regulatory frameworks, bank regulators are authorized and sometimes required to impose a wide range of requirements, conditions, and restrictions on banks and bank holding companies that fail to maintain adequate capital levels.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	D rought conditions in California could have an adverse impact on the Company s business.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	In recent years, California has experienced a severe drought.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P117_S1	However, during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 much of California has experienced significant rain.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	A significant portion of the Company s borrowers are involved in or are dependent on the agricultural industry in California, which requires water.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P118_S1	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 12% of the Company s loans were categorized as agricultural loans.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	As a result of the drought, there have been governmental proposals concerning the distribution or rationing of water.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P119_S1	If the amount of water available to agriculture becomes scarcer due to drought or rationing, growers may not be able to continue to produce agricultural products profitably, which could force some out of business.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P119_S2	Although many of the Company s customers are not directly involved in agriculture, they could be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry because many jobs and businesses in the Company s market areas are related to the production of agricultural products.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P119_S3	Therefore, the drought could adversely impact the Company s loan portfolio, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	The Company faces substantial competition from larger banks and other financial institutions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P121_S0	The Company faces substantial competition for deposits and loans.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P121_S1	Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P121_S2	Co mpetition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations and other financial intermediaries.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	Larger competitors, by virtue of their larger capital resources, have substantially greater lending limits and marketing resources than the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P122_S1	In addition, they have greater resources and may be able to offer longer maturities or lower rates.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P122_S2	The Company s competitors may also provide certain services for their customers, including trust and international banking that the Company is only able to offer indirectly through correspondent relationships.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P122_S3	Ultimately, competition can reduce the Company s profitability, as well as make it more difficult to increase the size of its loan portfolio and deposit base.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	There are risks associated with the Company s growth strategy.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	During the past two years, the Company completed the purchase and assumption of a branch office in Redding, California, opened a branch office in Reno, Nevada and established loan production offices in Phoenix, Arizona; Seattl e, Washington and Klamath Falls , Oregon.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P124_S1	The Company may engage in additional acquisition activity and open additional offices in the future to expand the Company s markets or further its growth strategy.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P124_S2	There is no assurance that future acquisitions or offices will be successful.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P124_S3	Further, growth may strain the Company s administrative, managerial, financial and operational resources and increase demands on its systems and controls.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P124_S4	If the Company pursues its growth strategy too aggressively, fails to attract qualified personnel, control costs or maintain asset quality, or if factors beyond management s control divert attention away from its business operations, the Company s pursuit of its growth strategy could have a material adverse impact on its existing business.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	The Company relies on key executives and personnel and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse impact on the Company s prospects.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	Competition for qualified e mployees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California community banking industry.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company s strategies is often lengthy.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P126_S2	The Company s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, compliance and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of its management and personnel.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P126_S3	In particular, the Company s success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives and certain other employees.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	Secur ity breaches and technological disruptions could damage the Company s reputation and profitability.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	The Company s business is highly reliant on third party vendors and its ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Company s electronic banking activities expose it to possible liability and loss of reputation should an unauthorized party gain access to confidential customer information.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P129_S1	Despite its considerable efforts and investment to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data, the Company cannot fully guarantee that these precautions will protect its systems from future compromises or breaches of its security measures.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P129_S2	Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test its security), failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect its ability to offer and grow its online services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact the Bank s reputation, and could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P129_S3	The Company may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company s business.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	Integral to the Company s performance is the continued efficacy of the Company s technology and information systems, operational infrastructure and relationships with third parties and its colleagues in its day-to-day and ongoing operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	Failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P131_S1	This includes, but is not limited to, operational or systems failures, disruption of client operations and activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as, the loss of key colleagues or failure on the part of key colleagues to perform properly.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	Additionally, the Company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties which may encounter technological or other difficul ties that may significantly affect the Company s ability to process and account for customer transactions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	These vendors provide services that support its operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data, as well as its sales efforts.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	A cyber security breach of a vendor s system may result in theft of the Company s data or disruption of business processes.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	In most cases, the Company will remain primarily liable to its customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor s data security system.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	The Company relies on its outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P134_S1	The loss of these vendor relationships could disrupt the services the Company provides to its customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Com pany is subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	In the past, the Company s business has been increasingly affected by these regulations, and this trend is likely to continue into the future.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S2	Many of these laws are subject to interpretation and changing regulatory approaches to supervision and enforcement.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S3	The Company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S4	The Company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S5	The Company may also suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations, that may also damage its reputation, and this in turn might materially affect its business and results of operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P136_S6	Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines, restitution or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports it files under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P138_S1	The Company believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P139_S1	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P139_S2	Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in its control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which could result in a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	The trading price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside its control.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	Among the factors that could affect the Company s stock price are:
1168455_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	domestic and international economic factors unrelated to its performance.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	Significant decline in the Company s stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	The trading volume of the Company s common stock is limited.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	Although the Company s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, trading volume to date has been relatively modest.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P144_S1	The limited trading market for the Company s common stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies compared to more actively traded securities.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P144_S2	It may also make it more difficult for investors to sell the Company s common stock at desired prices, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number of shares of stock.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	The Company depends primarily on the o perations of the Bank to repay its indebtedness and fund its operations .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P145_S1	The Company s ability to pay any dividends or repurchase any of its shares in the future will also depend on the success of the Bank s operations.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	The Company is a separate and dis tinct legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank, and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P146_S1	There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with, the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P146_S2	The Company s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	Disruptions in market conditions may adversely impact the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities .
1168455_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) require the Company to carry its available-for-sale investment securities at fair value on its balance sheet.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P148_S1	Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost, net of its tax effect, are reported as a component of shareholders equity.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	In certain instances GAAP requires recognition through earnings of declines in the fair value of securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P149_S1	Changes in the fair value of these securities may result from a number of circumstances that are beyond the Company s control, such as changes in interest rates, the financial condition of government sponsored enterprises or insurers of municipal bonds, changes in demand for these securities as a result of economic conditions, or reduced market liquidity.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P149_S2	There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to loss recognition that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s net income and capital levels.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	Damage to the Company s reputation could significantly harm the Company s business and prospects.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	The Company s reputation is an important asset.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	The Company s relationship with many of its customers is predicated upon its reputation as a high quality provider of financial services that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	The Company s ability to attract and retain customers, investors and employees depends upon external perceptions.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	Damage to its reputation among existing and potential customers, investors and employees could cause significant harm to the Company s business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, lending practices, inadequate protection of customer information, sales and marketing efforts, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	Adverse developments in the banking industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company s reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.
1168455_18_ITEM1_P152_S3	The Company has policies and procedures in place that seek to protect its reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.

1168455_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents a s ummary of selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on inves tment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and gains from the sale of government guaranteed loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California, are significan tly influenced by economic conditions in California, including the strength of the real estate market.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our most complex accounting p olicies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We eva luate our allowance for loan losses quarterly.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstanc es which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to allowance for loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Subsequent to foreclosure, we periodically evaluate the value of OREO held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors, including our historical experience, economic conditions, and issues specific to individual properties.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	It pertains to the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act ) was enacted into law.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The TCJ Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction of the top federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	The reduction in the corporate tax rate under the TCJ Act required a one-time revaluation of cert ain tax-related assets to reflect their value at the lower corporate tax rate of 21%.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	As such, the Company has recorded a reduction in the value of these assets of $1.4 million, which relates to the Company s net deferred tax assets.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Solely based on this reduction in certain tax assets, the Company recorded an additional provision for income taxes of $1.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in its income statement for the fourth quarter of 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net interest income increased by $ 3.8 million to $27.9 million during 2017 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $3.8 million and a decrease in interest expense of $6 thousand.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	Interest on loans increased by $2.9 million , interest on investment securities increased by $581 thousand and interest on other interest earning assets increased by $400 thousand.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	The provision for loan losses was $600 thousand during 2017 down $200 thousand from $800 thousand during 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	During the year ended December 31, 201 7 non-interest income totaled $8.3 million an increase of $628 thousand from the $7.7 million earned during 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Non-interest expense increased by $1.4 million to $20.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The largest component of the increase in non-interest expense was an increase in salary and benefit expense of $1.1 million .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The provision for income taxes increased by $ 2.5 million from $4.8 million in 2016 to $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total assets at December 31, 201 7 were $745 million, an increase of $87.5 million from $658 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase included increases of $24.9 million in cash and due from banks, $35.9 million in investment securities, $25.7 million in net loans ($25.5 million in gross loans), $0.3 million in bank owned life insurance, $0.6 million in OREO and $ 0.5 million in other assets exclusive of OREO.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	These items were partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in premises and equipment.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Gross l oan balances increased by $25.5 million, or 5.5%, from $461 million at December 31, 2016 to $487 million at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in loan balances includes $14.1 million in commercial real estate loans, $7.8 million in agricultural loans, $3.3 million in construction and land development loans and $6.9 million in automobile loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	These increases were partially offset by declines in other loan categories the largest of which was a decrease of $4.7 million in residential real estate loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Total deposits increased by $80.3 million, or 14%, from $582.4 million at December 31, 2016 to $662.7 million at December 31, 2017.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Core deposit growth remained strong in 2017 as evidenced by increases of $45.5 million in demand deposits, $27.0 million in savings accounts, $3.5 million in money market accounts and $7.9 million in interest bearing transaction accounts.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	Time deposits declined by $3.6 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company has no brokered deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Total shareholders equity increased by $7.7 million from $48.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $55.7 million at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The $7.7 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $8.2 million, a decrease in the net unrealized loss on investment securities of $0.4 million; stock option activity totaling $0.4 million and a $0.1 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	These items were partially offset by the payment of two $0.14 semi-annual cash dividends totaling $1.4 million.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:
1168455_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Average nonaccrual loan balances of $3.2 million for 2017, $3.8 million for 2016 and $5.6 million for 2015 are included in average loan balances for computational purposes.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Loan origination fees and costs are included in interest income as adjustments of the loan yields over the life of the loan using the interest method.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Loan interest income includes net loan costs of $501,000, $678,000 and $696,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative chan ges of volume and rates:
1168455_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year s rate.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year s average balance.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	201 7 compared to 201 6 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The $3.8 million included an increase of $3.8 million, or 15.4% , in interest income, from $25.1 million during 2016 to $28.9 million during the current year and a decrease of $6 thousand in interest expense.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Interest and fees on l oans increased by $2.9 million, interest on investment securities increased by $581 thousand and interest on deposits increased by $4 00 thousand.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	These increases include both an increase in average balance and an increase in average yield.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest and fees on loans was $25.8 million during 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The average loan balances were $471.7 million for 2017, up $43.3 million from the $428.4 million during 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The following table compares loan balances by type at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The average yield on loans was 5.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	47% for 2017 up 12 basis points from 5.35% for 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 59 basis points mostly offset to by price competition in our service area .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	At December 31, 2017 approximately 30% of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	During the current period yield benefited from market conditions and the maturity, sales and payments on lower earning securities.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $674 thousand in 2017 and $274 thousand in 2016, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The $400 thousand increase in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to an increase in yield of 57 basis points from 62 basis points in 2016 to 119 basis points in 2017; consistent with the increase in the average fed funds rate during these periods.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	We attribute much of the decrease in yield to price competition in our service area for commercial real estate loans mostly offset by the 25 basis point increase in the prime rate on December 17, 2015.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P70_S7	We attribute the decline in gain on sale of SBA loans to a decline in the average of the rate paid on loans sold as well as a reduction in SBA loan sale premiums related to market conditions.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P80_S4	Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act ) was enacted into law.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The TCJ Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	Those changes will impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction of the top federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	They will also provide for changes or limitations to certain tax deductions.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The reduction in the corporate tax rate under the TCJ Act required a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets to re flect their value at the lower corporate tax rate of 21%.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	As such, the Company has recorded a reduction in the value of these assets of $1.4 million, which relates to the Company s net deferred tax assets.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Solely based on this reduction in certain tax assets, the Company recorded an additional provision for income taxes of $1.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in its income statement for the fourth quarter of 2017.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P83_S4	The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	As shown in the following table the Company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, equity lines of credit, agricultural loans and commercial loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Construction and land development loans represented 5.2% and 4.7% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	The construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by Management as a higher-risk loan category.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	The quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the Company has securing the loan in the event of default.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The decline in these loans as a percentage of the Company s loan portfolio from over 21% at December 31, 2007 to less than 6% during the last two years reflects management s efforts, which began in 2009, to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 72% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, and Sierra and in Washoe County in Northern Nevada.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, the concentration of the Company s operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 75% and 74%, respectively of the Company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 4 0% and 42%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company s historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 12.4% of gross loans at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry in Northeastern California and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	The Company s agricultural loan balances totaled $59 million at December 31, 2017 and $51 million at December 31, 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 201 7.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:
1168455_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	The Company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	The Company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	In management s opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Company has implemented MARC to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming assets.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	It consists of the Bank s Chief Executive Officer,Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	More specifically, a formal plan to effect repayment and/or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed an d documented for review and on-going oversight by the MARC.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Some of the strategies used include but are not limited to: 1) obtaining additional collateral, 2) obtaining additional investor cash infusion, 3) sale of the promissory note to an outside party, 4) proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral, and 5) legal action against borrower/guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and/or collect any deficiency balance owed.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	Each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties; including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in th e form of the provision for loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	The discretionary allocation is based upon managemen t s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	T he following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $600 thousand and $800 thousand, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	Net charge-offs totaled $480 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017 up $151 thousand from $329 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	This increase was mostly related to an increase in charge-offs on automobile loans.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased from 0.08% during 2016 to 0.10% during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	The following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:
1168455_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	The allowance for loan losses totaled $6. 7 million at December 31, 2017 and $6.5 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $284 thousand from $366 thousand at December 31, 2016 to $82 thousand at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	General reserves were $6.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $6.2 million at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.42% at December 31, 2016 to 1.37% at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.36% at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 were three loans to one customer totaling $1.8 million that were 90 days past due and still accruing interest.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	These loans were well secured and in process of collection at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	As of March 7, 2018 we have collected $1.7 million in principal on these loans through the liquidation of a portion of the collateral securing the loans reducing the outstanding balance to $0.1 million.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P112_S3	We anticipate collecting the remaining principal and interest by March 31, 2018 through liquidation of the remaining collateral.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to t he debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	Loans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $1.1 million, $2.6 million, $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 5 of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	The following table sets forth the amount of the Company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	Nonperforming loans at December 31, 201 6 were 3.0 million, an increase of $298 thousand from the $2.7 million balance at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $24 thousand at December 31, 2017 and $298 thousand at December 31, 2016, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P121_S2	Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $3.4 million at December 31, 2017 and $2.0 million at December 31, 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	A substandard loan is not adequately p rotected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	Total substandard loans decreased by $243 thousand from $3.4 million at December 31, 2016 to $3.2 million at December 31, 2017 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P122_S2	Loans classified as special mention decreased by $603 thousand from $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 to $642 thousand at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P122_S3	At December 31, 2017, $ 0.5 million of performing loans were classified as substandard.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P122_S4	Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	At December 31, 201 7 and December 31, 2016, the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $2.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $82 thousand and $366 thousand at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	Additionally, $11 thousand and $657 thousand had been charged off against the impaired loans at December 31, 2017 and December 31 2016 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	Management believes that the allowance at December 31, 2017 is appropriate.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P124_S3	Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	OREO holdings represented six properties totaling $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 and six properties totaling $735 thousand at December 31, 2016.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	The balances, at December 31, 2017, earn interest at the rate of 1.50%.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company s asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	The following tables summarize the values of the Company s investment securities held on the dates indicated:
1168455_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2017 .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Total deposits increased by $80.3 million, or 14%, from $582.4 million at December 31, 2016 to $662.7 million at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	At December 31, 2017, 43% of the Company s deposits were in the form of non-interest bearing demand deposits.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P134_S3	Time deposits declined by $3.6 million, much of which we attribute to migration into other types of deposits given the low rates and lack of liquidity associated with time deposits.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P134_S4	The Company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	The following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 201 7 and 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funds.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P136_S2	These sources are considered to be relatively stable , long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	In order to assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	In July, 2013, the federal b ank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S6	Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P157_S7	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the Policy Statement ) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	The following table sets forth the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):
1168455_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	Management believes that Plumas Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	The current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans a nd long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S1	Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $107.4 million in unfunded loan commitments and $477 thousand in letters of credit.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S3	This compares to 93.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and $625 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S4	Of the $107.4 million in unfunded loan commitments, $62.2 million and $45.2 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S5	Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2017, $58.6 million were secured by real estate, of which $23.9 million was secured by commercial real estate and $34.7 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S6	The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P164_S7	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company leases two depository branches and three lending offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Total rental expenses under all operating leases were $308,000 and $276,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2018 and the last such lease expiring during 2021.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	The Company s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P166_S2	On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P166_S3	On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $ 206 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $322 million.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million.

1168455_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	The Company s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth.
1168455_18_ITEM7_P169_S3	Management believes that the Company s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.
1168455_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As a smaller reporting company we are not required t o provide the information required by this item.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of mat erial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of mate rial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial state ments for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all b ranches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	The allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investments are classified into o ne of the following categories:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Available-for-sale securities reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold, reported at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	As of December 31, 201 7 and 2016 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in certain limited circumstances.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	As of December 31, 201 7 and 2016 the Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading and gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed on the specific identification method.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Interest earned on investment securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums accounted for by the level yield method with no pre-payment anticipated.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Invest ment securities that are impaired are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Management uti lizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S3	The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S4	Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P36_S5	If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The investment is carried at cost classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company held $2,685,000 and $2,438,000, respectively of FHLB stock .
1168455_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	On the consolidated balance sheet, FHLB stock is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Included in the loan portfolio are loans which are 75% to 85% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), US Department of Agriculture Rural Business Cooperative Service (RBS) and Farm Services Agency (FSA).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The guaranteed porti on of these loans may be sold to a third party, with the Bank retaining the unguaranteed portion.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company can receive a premium in excess of the adjusted carrying value of the loan at the time of sale.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	As of December 31, 201 7 and 2016 the Company had $614 thousand and $2.5 million, respectively in government guaranteed loans held for sale.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	The fair values for loans held for sale are based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed loan sale prices.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Government guaranteed loans with unpaid balances of $112,781,000 and $96,592,000 were being serviced for others at December 31, 20 17 and 2016, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company accounts for the transfer and servicing of financial assets based on the fair value of financial and servicing assets it controls and liabilities it has assumed, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Servicing rights acquired through 1 ) a purchase or 2 ) the origination of loans which are sold or securitized with servicing rights retained are recognized as separate assets or liabilities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Ser vicing assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value and are subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of the related net servicing income or expense.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Changes in valuation allowances are reported with non-interest income on the statement of income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company s investment in the loan is allocated between the retained portion of the loan and the sold portion of the loan based on their fair values on the date the loan is sold.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	The gain on the sold portion of the loan is recognized as income at the ti me of sale.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The carrying value of the retained portion of the loan is discounted based on the estimated value of a comparable non-guaranteed loan.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Loans, if any, that are transferred from loans held for sale are carried at the lower of principal balance or market value at the date of transfer, adjusted for accretion of discounts.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan balances.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	However, when, in the opinion of management, loans are considered to be impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, loans are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Payments received are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to ensure collection.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment unless well secured and in the process of collection.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to earned but unpaid interest and then to principal.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchased premiums and discounts on loans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to intere st income over the contractual term of the loan.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	The unamortized balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company may acquire loans through a business combination or a purchase for which differences may exist betwe en the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected due, at least in part, to credit quality.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company s initial investment in the loan.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an i mpairment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	At December 31, 201 7 and 2016, there were no such loans being accounted for under this policy.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired but collectively evaluated for impairment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	A loan is considered impaired when , based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	A restruc turing of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The determi nation of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, to include, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment from January 1, 2008 ( the beginning of the latest business cycle as determined by management) to the most current balance sheet date, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company maintains a separate allowance for each portfolio segment (loan type).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	These portfolio segments include commercial, agricultural, real estate construction (including land and development loans), commercial real estate mortgage, residential mortgage, home equity loans, automobile loans and other loans primarily consisting of consumer installment loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	The allowance for loan losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company s overall allowance, and is included as a component of loans on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all criticized and classified loans over $100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the ove rall collectability of the portfolio.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company and the Company s regulators.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The risk ratings can be grouped into three major categories, defined as follows:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses my result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Substandard A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	Well defined weaknesses include a project s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project s failure to fulfill economic expectations.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Doubtful Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass-rated loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment also consists of reserve factors that a re based on management s assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: ( 1 ) historical losses and ( 2 ) other qualitative factors, including inherent credit risk.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	These reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment described below .
1168455_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Commercial Commercial loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	Debt coverage is provided by business cash flows and economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Agricultural Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Real e state Residential and Home Equity Lines of Credit The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower s ability to repay in an orderly fashion.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P78_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Real estate Commercial Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real estate projects and may result in troubled loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	High vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Real estate Construction and Land Development Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real estate portfolio segments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified cost and time lines.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	Trends in the construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	In addition, trends in real estate values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Automobile An automobile loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of smaller loans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	Most automobile loans are made directly for consumer purchases, but business vehicles may also be included.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	Weak economic trends indicate that the borrowers capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Other Other loans primarily consist of consumer loans and are similar in nature to automobile loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ulti mate losses may vary from its estimates.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	At least quarterly, the Board of Directors and management review the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P83_S3	In addition, the Company s primary regulators, the FDIC and DBO, as an integral part of their examination process, review the adequacy of the allowance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P83_S4	These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company also maintains a separate allowance for off-balance-sheet commitments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	M anagement estimates anticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	The allowance for these commitments totaled $200,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Other real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, which was $1,344,000 ( $2,642,000 less a valuation allowance of $1,298,000 ) at December 31, 2017 and $735,000 ( $2,005,000 less a valuation allowance of $1,270,000 ) at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	Of these amounts $110,000 at December 31, 2017 and 84,000 at December 31, 2016 represent foreclosed residential real estate property.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	No consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties were in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2017.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	There were four consumer mortgage loans with a balance of $335 thousand secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S4	Proceeds from sales of other real estate owned totaled $689,000, $2,245,000 and $2,281,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded gains on sale of other real estate owned of $13 0,000, $60,000 and $198,000, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S6	Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell when acquired, any excess of the Bank s recorded investment in the loan balance and accrued interest income over the estimated fair value of the property less costs to sell is charged against the allowance for loan losses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S7	A valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for temporary declines in value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S8	The allowance is established through a provision for losses on other real estate which is included in other expenses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P86_S9	Subsequent gains or losses on sales or write-downs resulting from permanent impairment are also recorded in other expenses as incurred.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the years ended December 31, 201 7 and 2016:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles related to branch acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over a period not to exceed fifteen years.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The Company evaluates the recoverability and remaining useful life annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the intangible asset or the remaining period of amortization.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	There were no such events or circumstances during the periods presented.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, intangible assets totaled $81,000 and $87,000, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	The useful lives of premises are estimated to be twenty to thirty years.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	The useful lives of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated to be two to ten years.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for ot her charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than- not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	There have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes d ilution, is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (net income plus discount on redemption of preferred stock less preferred dividends and accretion) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P103_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted EPS.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	The amount reclassifie d out of other accumulated comprehensive income relating to realized (losses) gains on securities available for sale was $( 158,000 ) , $( 32 ,000 ) and $21,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, with the related tax effect of $( 65,000 ), $( 13 ,000 ) and $9,000, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 - 02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company early adopted this new standard in the current year.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	ASU 2018 - 02 allows entities to elect to reclassify stranded tax effects on items within AOCI, resulting from the new tax bill signed into law on December 22, 2017, to retained earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of signifi cant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	Compensation expense related to the Company s Stock Option Plans, net of related tax benefit, recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $141,000, $103,000 and $63,000 or $0.03, $0.02 and $0.01 per diluted share, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line accounting basis.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Company determines the fair value of options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life, expected stock volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	The expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P110_S3	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of the grant.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	During 2016 the Company granted options to purchase 108,000 shares of common stock, respectively.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 - 09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	ASU 2016 - 09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	The Company adopted ASU No. 2016 - 09 on January 1, 2017 and elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P113_S3	The cumulative effect adjustment from the modified retrospective transition of the forfeitures and the classification of awards did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements or disclosures.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P113_S4	The Company expects adoption of ASU No. 2016 - 09 could result in increased volatility to reported income tax expense related to excess tax benefits .
1168455_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 - 02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	ASU 2018 - 02 allows entities to elect to reclassify stranded tax effects on items within AOCI, resulting from the new tax bill signed into law on December 22, 2017, to retained earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	The Company elected to early adopt this new standard in 2017 and recorded a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings in the amount of $94,000 .
1168455_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 - 09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	This update to the ASC is the culmination of e fforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P115_S2	ASU 2014 - 09 supersedes Topic 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	The guidance in ASU 2014 - 09 describes a 5 -step process entities can apply to achieve the core principle of revenue recognition and requires disclosures sufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and the significant judgments used in determining that information.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	This update was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein and requires expanded disclosures.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	In July 2015 the FASB issued a deferral of ASU 2014 - 09 of one year making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 while also providing for early adoption but not before the original effective date.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P117_S2	Since the guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other GAAP, the Company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on revenue most closely associated with financial instruments, including interest income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P117_S3	The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014 - 09 on January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective approach.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	On January 5, 2 016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016 - 01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	Changes made to the current measurement model primarily affect the accounting for equity securities with readily determinable fair values, where changes in fair value will impact earnings instead of other comprehensive income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P118_S3	The Update also changes the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments including a requirement that public business entities use exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for disclosure purposes.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P118_S4	This Update is generally effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation of the provisions of ASU No. 2016 - 01.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that ASU No. 2016 - 01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company will continue to closely monitor developments and additional guidance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 - 02, Leases.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	The most significant change for lessees is the requirement under the new guidance to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases, which is generally defined as a lease term of less than 12 months.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	This change will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under current lease accounting guidance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P120_S3	ASU 2016 - 02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company has several lease agreements, including two branch locations, which are currently considered operating leases, and therefore, not recognized on the Company s consolidated statements of condition.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The Company expects the new guidance will require some of these lease agreements to now be recognized on the consolidated statements of condition as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P121_S2	Therefore, the Company s preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016 - 02 are expected to impact the Company s consolidated statements of condition.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P121_S3	However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of potential impact the new guidance will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	ASU No. 2016 - 13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certai n other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	The standard will replace today s incurred loss approach with an expected loss model.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S3	The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: ( 1 ) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and ( 2 ) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S4	This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S5	The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S6	For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S7	The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S8	ASU No. 2016 - 13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P122_S9	ASU No. 2016 - 13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Company has begun its implementation efforts by establishing an implementation team chaired by the Company s Chief Lending Officer and composed of members of the Company s credit administration and accounting departments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Company s preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016 - 13 are expected to impact the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of the potential impact.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	On March 30, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017 - 08, Receivables Non-Refundable Fees and Other Costs: Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	This ASU amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium, shortening such period to the earliest call date.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	ASU 2017 - 08 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation of the provisions of ASU No. 2017 - 08.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P127_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that ASU No. 2017 - 08 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	Level 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon th e nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 201 7 are as follows:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2016 are as follows:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated futu re business related to the instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The followin g methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Investment securities: Fair values for securities available for sale are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 ).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P143_S2	Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	It was not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, including interest and non-interest demand accounts, savings, and certain types of money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	Repurchase agreements: The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is estimated based on bid quotations received from brokers using observable inputs and are included as Level 2.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	Payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures: The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are considered to be linked in classification to the asset or liability for which they relate.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit: The fair value of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and are not significant and, therefore, not presented.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	Commitments to extend credit are primarily for variable rate loans and letters of credit.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instru ments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P159_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices for similar securities or matrix pricing.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P159_S2	There were no changes in the valuation techniques used during 2017 or 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	Transfers between hierarchy measurement levels are recognized by the Company as of the beginning of the reporting period.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following methods were used to estimate fair value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans : The Bank does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	However, from time to time, fair value adjustments are recorded on these loans to reflect partial write-downs, through charge-offs or specific reserve allowances, that are based on fair value estimates of the underlying collateral.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P166_S2	The fair value estimates for collateral-dependent impaired loans are generally based on recent real estate appraisals or broker opinions, obtained from independent third parties, which are frequently adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and estimated selling costs (Level 3 ).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P166_S3	Net gains (losses) of $7,000 and $( 75 ,000 ) represent impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the above impaired loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	Other Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P167_S1	In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property which are commonly adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and selling costs (Level 3 ).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and oth er real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P169_S1	Once received, a member of the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P169_S2	On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling price of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any, should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P169_S3	Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P218_S1	These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P218_S2	These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P219_S1	The Company uses the same credi t policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheet.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:
1168455_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P221_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P221_S2	Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P222_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P222_S2	Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, inventory, equipment, income-producing commercial properties, farm land and residential properties.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the pe rformance of a customer to a third party.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P223_S1	The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P223_S2	The fair value of the liability related to these letters of credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P223_S3	The Company recognizes these fees as revenues over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P224_S0	At December 31, 201 7, consumer loan commitments represent approximately 1 0% of total commitments and are generally unsecured.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P224_S1	Commercial and agricultural loan commitments represent approximately 38% of total commitments and are generally secured by various assets of the borrower.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P224_S2	Real estate loan commitments, including consumer home equity lines of credit, represent the remaining 52% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P224_S3	In addition, the majority of the Company s commitments have variable interest rates.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans to customers throughout Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Sierra, Shasta and Modoc counties in California and Washoe county in Northern Nevada.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantia l portion of its portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P226_S1	A continued substantial decline in the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P226_S2	However, personal and business income represents the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ord inary course of business.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P227_S1	In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P231_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P231_S2	The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	Shares of common stock issuable under stock options and warrants for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P232_S1	Stock options a nd warrants not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, due to shares not being in the-money and having an antidilutive effect, were 0, 63,000 and 53,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	As of December 31, 2017, all remaining shares in this plan have vested and no compensation cost remains unrecognized.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	The total fair value of o ptions vested was $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P235_S1	The total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $590,000 and $427,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Bank is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P243_S1	Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and poss ibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P244_S0	Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that invo lved quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P244_S1	These quantitative measures are established by regulation and require that minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets be maintained.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P244_S2	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P245_S1	To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table on the following page and cannot be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive issued by the FDIC.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S0	In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III .
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S1	The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S2	Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S3	The new capital rules include a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0% ), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets).
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S4	The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S5	In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S6	Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P246_S7	The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P249_S0	T he current and projected capital positions of the Company and the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long- term strategies are reviewed regularly by management.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company policy is to maintain the Bank s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P254_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expect ed to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P255_S0	The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P255_S1	The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P255_S2	More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P255_S3	All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.

1168455_18_ITEM8_P256_S1	The Company s deferred tax assets primarily relate timing differences in the tax deductibility of impairment charges on other real estate owned, deprecation on premises and equipment, the provision for loan losses and deferred compensation.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P256_S2	Based upon our analysis of available evidence, management of the Company determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P257_S0	On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
1168455_18_ITEM8_P258_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to operating income before income taxes.
