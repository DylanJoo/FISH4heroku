1009759_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ("Capstone" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), resource recovery and secure power.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	There are several technologies that are used to provide "on-site power generation" (also called "distributed generation") such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on-site power with lower scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand-alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold primarily through our distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P2_S6	Service is provided directly by us through our Factory Protection Plan ("FPP") or by our distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial, and utility users from 30 kilowatts ("kW") up to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our 30 kW ("C30") microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	The 65 kW ("C65") microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100-room hotel while also providing about one-third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings, and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S4	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S5	Our 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S6	Our microturbines combine patented air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S7	Because of our air-bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P5_S8	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our products produce exceptionally clean power.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our C65 was certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our C65 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified in January 2008 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Gas systems were certified in November 2010 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS") and entered into a manufacturing sub-contract agreement and an original equipment manufacturer agreement with selected exclusive rights to package a combined microturbine and waste heat recovery generator product.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry and the 100 kW rating fits well between our C65 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	The 125 kW waste heat recovery generator can be directly fired by the exhaust of six C65 or two C200 microturbines to provide a total of over 500 kW of clean and efficient green power in applications where the microturbine exhaust is not otherwise utilized, such as CHP or CCHP.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after-market parts and services.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S4	Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users' sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post-commissioning service.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P10_S5	Our distributors perform as value-added resellers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	OEMs integrate Capstone's products into their own product solutions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Capstone has also established outside sales representatives who qualify and close customer orders for direct sales by Capstone.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer ("FTI") training and certification program.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We offer a Conceptual Approval ("CA") process to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow, and turbine exhaust routing.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Capstone has a factory direct service offering for commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We offer a comprehensive FPP where Capstone charges a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled maintenance, as well as other maintenance as needed.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	Capstone then performs the required maintenance directly with its own personnel or contracts with one of its local distributors to do so.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers ("ASPs") and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ("C60"), which was replaced by the C65 models during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	We began shipping the C60 Integrated CHP solution in 2003.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO-sized container.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our C1000 Series product beta testing was successfully implemented during Fiscal 2009 and the first commercial shipment was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	During Fiscal 2011, we booked total orders of $86.5 million for 554 units, or 91.9 megawatts, compared to $73.5 million for 620 units, or 77.2 megawatts, during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We shipped 611 units with an aggregate of 69.7 megawatts, generating revenue of $66.4 million compared to 499 units with an aggregate of 52.8 megawatts, generating revenue of $48.7 million during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Total backlog as of March 31, 2011 increased $20.1 million, or 23%, to $106.4 million from $86.3 million at March 31, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	As of March 31, 2011, we had 669 units, or 118.6 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 726 units, or 96.4 megawatts, for the same period last year.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, all of the backlog was current and expected to be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer payments and changes in customer delivery schedules), many of which are not in our control and can affect our revenue and backlog.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P17_S6	During Fiscal 2011, we booked our first order for 14 waste heat recovery generators, 12 of which are in the ending backlog as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat, compared to competing technologies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ("BTU") gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills or agrodigesters.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features:
1009759_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	advanced combustion technology; patented air-bearing technology; digital power electronics; and remote monitoring.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions capability with a design that is simple to manufacture.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The air-bearing system allows the microturbine's single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum-based lubrication.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Air-bearings use a high-pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	For instance, our electronics control the microturbine's speed, temperature and fuel flow and communicate with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid-connect mode and with the on-board battery when equipped for stand-alone mode.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	All control functions are performed digitally.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; on a stand-alone basis as a voltage source; multipacked to support larger loads as a "virtual single" unit; and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also offer C65 and C200 ICHP systems.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	These systems combine the standard C65 and C200 microturbine unit with a Heat Recovery Module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual-mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies to OEMs.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone's proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	start the turbogenerator and manage its load; coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid; manage the speed, fuel flow, and exhaust temperature of the microturbine; convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz, and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC or DC for HEV applications; and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	In addition, our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ("CRMS") allows end users to remotely operate and manage the microturbine.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require manual monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to remotely and efficiently monitor performance, power generation and time of operation using our CRMS interface software with standard personal computers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our Internet-based communication system, the Capstone Service Network ("CSN"), provides continuous remote monitoring and diagnostics to customers who purchase the service.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	If the CSN detects an out-of-limit condition or alarm, it automatically notifies the responsible distributor for immediate follow-up action.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have expanded our microturbines' functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Capstone microturbines' multi-fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our C65 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our 30 kW and 60 kW microturbine power systems as the first products to comply with the requirements of its "Rule 21" grid interconnection standard.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site-by-site and utility-by-utility analysis.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre-cleared our microturbines for connection to New York's electric utility grid.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our 60 kW microturbine power system was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our C65 microturbine now meets the even more stringent CARB 2007 standard for natural gas, as well as the 2008 CARB standard for landfill and digester gas fuels.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The TA100 microturbine power system offers a digital communications interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand-alone operation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous-area oil and gas applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	These specially packed systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW, to back-up generators as small as two kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States, has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide from applications as small as 30 kW up to 5 MW.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our broad family of microturbine based low emission solutions are used in a variety of applications generally requiring a minimum of 30 kW and a maximum of 5 MW.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Within the distributed generation markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	In the markets we are focusing on (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products), we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall green house gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our microturbines' emissions of commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants") such as Nitrogen oxides ("NOx") and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") are lower than those from the on-site boilers that our CHP system displaces meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P46_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of expensive fuels and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The most prominent uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, schools, big box retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	A study conducted for the US Department of Energy ("DOE") calculated the total potential energy efficiency CHP market in the United States to be over 35.5 gigawatts through 2020.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Further, we have our own integrated energy efficiency CHP product for the C65 and C200 products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our microturbine products can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications like cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	Capstone's product can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution, while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding community.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our microturbine products have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	In February 2010, we entered into an agreement with CPS to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generators in exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements during a three-year period ending February 1, 2013.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes creates fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our microturbine products are installed in the natural resource market to be used at oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbine product for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves or plays in the United States.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	In mid 2010 Capstone sold its first turbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	The market for Capstone turbines and microturbines in this industry is vast.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	The shale gas market is expected to grow substantially, especially since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act has strict requirements for emissions levels at natural gas sites.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology and information systems companies require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Capstone's secure power offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source ("UPS") solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	We offer two microturbine-powered UPS solutions that support prime and dispatched power options.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	The Capstone UPSource microturbine-powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	Capstone's Hybrid UPS microturbine powered solution provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power solutions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	Both secure power products offer eight 9's of reliability (99.999999%) in common N + 1 configurations.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S5	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P57_S6	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	This provides end users with a backup system with a short return on investment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric vehicles such as transit buses, trucks and boats.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the electric vehicle battery system as needed.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P59_S3	The benefits of this microturbine hybrid include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, before after treatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating exhaust after-treatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	With the introduction of the C200 and C1000 Series products, management anticipates that our microturbines will be used in applications requiring up to five megawatts.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine products through distributors, and in some cases, we sell our microturbine products directly to end users.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our parts are sold to distributors and end users.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment due anywhere from in advance of shipment to 90 days from shipment, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 18 months from shipment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources and mobile products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P64_S4	We have received pre-approval by the New York State Public Services Commission for installation and interconnection to the electric utilities in New York, and we meet the California interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	In February 2009, we introduced our factory rental program primarily to target the oil gas and telecommunication sectors that frequently deploy temporary power solutions while they build out permanent infrastructure.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our market focus in Asia and Australia is energy efficiency and natural resources.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the oil gas market.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P68_S3	South Korea and China are areas where resource recovery applications and CHP and CCHP solutions are expected to experience market growth.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Renewable energy applications have been growing in Europe based on attractive incentives established in several countries.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Further, Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in South America has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout South America.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our market focus in South America is energy efficiency and natural resources.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Sales to Banking Production Centre ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, and Pumps and Service Company ("Pumps and Service"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 23% and 18%, respectively, of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	Sales to BPC accounted for 23%, 14% and 13% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	Sales to Pumps and Service accounted for 18%, 4% and 6% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	Sales to Aquatec-Maxcon Pty Ltd. ("Aquatec"), our Australian distributor, accounted for 4%, 14% and 5% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	Additionally, BPC and Verdesis S.A. ("Verdesis"), the Company's Belgian distributor, accounted for 26% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P73_S5	BPC and Greenvironment plc, the Company's Finnish distributor, accounted for 20% and 16%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	economies of scale, worldwide presence and greater resources, which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies, such as fuel cells or microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (resource recovery/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	A reciprocating engine is also known as an internal combustion engine similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	These technologies, which typically have a lower up-front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by, among others, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Dresser Waukesha, a business unit of Dresser, Inc., GE Energy Jenbacher gas engines, Deutz Corporation and Kohler Power Systems, a division of Kohler Co.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	Solar-powered and wind-powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	The main drawbacks to solar-powered and wind-powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours; including FuelCell Energy Inc., UTC Power Corporation ("UTCP"), Plug Power Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Fuel cells, like wind-powered systems and solar power systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	Management believes that, absent these high government-supported incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	However, over the medium-to-long term, fuel cell technologies that compete more directly with our products may be introduced.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including Flex Energy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	Overall, we compete with end users' other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbines' ability to:
1009759_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; operate on multiple fuel types; reduce emissions both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gasses; simplify operation; and control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S2	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S3	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S4	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S5	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S6	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S7	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S8	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S9	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P87_S10	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	In February 2009, the President of the United States signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA").
1009759_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	ARRA has dedicated billions of dollars towards clean energy research and deployment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	Some of Capstone's distributors' projects in Fiscal 2010 were partly funded through ARRA with payments made directly to federal agencies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Members of Congress introduced legislation in calendar 2009 and 2010 that may benefit Capstone in Fiscal 2012.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	In addition, certain proposed changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may result in positive tax benefits for our end users.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	This proposed legislation targets CHP, hybrid electric and natural gas-powered vehicles.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	Additionally, Capstone continues to engage with Federal and State policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone's low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however, or that it will benefit us if enacted.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	In California, the Self Generation Incentive Program was modified to allow natural gas and energy efficiency CHP applications to receive rebates.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	However, at this time, management believes that our end users would not realize any significant benefits to their capital equipment purchase plans until the second half of calendar 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	While we continue to receive development funding, committed amounts remaining are relatively low.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P92_S2	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high-volume, low-cost production objectives.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	The microturbines are designed for simple assembly and testing and to facilitate automated production techniques using less-skilled labor.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our strategy of outsourcing the manufacturing and assembly of our nonproprietary product components allows for more attractive pricing, quick ramp-up and the use of just-in-time inventory management techniques.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	While the current variability in our demand volumes and resulting imprecise demand forecasting affect our ability to leverage these capabilities, management believes that we can realize economies of scale related to our product manufacturing costs as unit volume increases.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	assemble and test units as well as manufacture air-bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	Additionally, we manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	We have primary and secondary sources for other critical components and have evaluated our core competencies and identified additional outsourcing opportunities which we are now actively pursuing.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P95_S3	We monitor parts subject to a single or a limited source supply to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could impact our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., had been our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	In 2000, we exercised an option to license Solar's technology, which allows us to manufacture recuperator cores ourselves.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	In June 2001, we started to manufacture recuperator cores.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P97_S3	Recuperator cores using the Solar technology, which we make and sell, are subject to a per-unit royalty fee.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P97_S4	As of March 31, 2011, cumulative royalties of $0.3 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	On April 28, 2011, we purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory from CPS that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements during a three-year period, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P99_S2	We must meet specified annual sales targets in order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell the waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, R D expense was $7.0 million, $7.0 million and $8.1 million and was 9%, 11% and 19% of total revenue, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as the DOE grant and the Development and License Agreement ("Development Agreement") with Carrier Corporation ("Carrier"), successor in interest to UTC Power Corporation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	Benefits from cost-sharing programs were $0.9 million, $1.7 million and $8.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	The CARB has established extremely high industry standards for distributed generation technologies by requiring them to meet emissions levels comparable to the Best Available Control Technology for large state-of-the-art central utility power plants.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Capstone's microturbines have become even "greener" with the ultra low emissions product designed to meet this CARB 2007 standard which reduced previous requirements for NOx by 86%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 98%, and VOCs by 98%.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition to the emission reductions, test results showed that the microturbine removed concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the ambient air.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	maintenance for the life of the system.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	This is in contrast to exhaust cleanup systems used by traditional reciprocating engine driven generation equipment that use chemicals such as ammonia or urea and need frequent adjustments to maintain proper function and air quality.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	Certification to this standard allows generators to be installed in most of the major air quality management districts in California without regular on-site emissions testing.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P103_S3	To date, only microturbines and fuel cells have been certified to this new standard.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P103_S4	Installing six 65 kW microturbines operating 24 hours a day reduces NOx emissions by approximately five tons per year which equates to the environmental impact of taking 258 cars off the road, based on EPA emissions and efficiency data for the average U.S. power plant and average passenger vehicle.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	Capstone enhanced its C65 microturbine to meet the CARB 2007 standard with co-funding from the DOE.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	Capstone microturbines were the first power generation technology to receive CARB 2008 Waste Gas Emissions certification for operation on landfill and digester gas.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	Capstone microturbines are capable of burning waste gases with methane contents as low as 30% which can be challenging for competing combustion technologies.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P105_S2	We achieve CARB waste gas emissions requirements with our low premix combustion technology inherent to the microturbine which requires no exhaust after treatment.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P105_S3	Certification to the new waste fuel emissions standard makes approved technologies such as the Capstone landfill and digester microturbines much easier to locate in California.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P105_S4	Producing energy using gas from these applications avoids the need to use non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, or natural gas to produce the same amount of energy.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	Capstone released for sale its C65 Liquid Fuel configuration microturbine system.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	The high reliability benefits of the Capstone microturbine product make it well suited for remote power and secure power applications which often use liquid fuel.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P106_S2	Capstone liquid fuel microturbines are able to burn a variety of fuels including kerosene, high and low sulfur diesel, and biodiesel blends.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	Capstone released versions of its C30 and C65 microturbine products for operation in high humidity applications.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	The new package provides resistance to corrosive environmental conditions typical of coastal, jungle and other high humidity installations.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Previously released products for offshore manned and unmanned platforms have been well received by our oil and gas customers.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	The high humidity package is a further offering to many of these same customers for use at land-based oil and gas facilities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our more recent significant R D activity has been the C200 microturbine a 200 kW, higher electrical efficiency product.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	Capstone worked with the DOE on its "Advanced MicroTurbine System" program and received funding for some of the early C200 development efforts.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	C200 beta testing demonstrated performance to design objectives making the C200 the highest electrical efficiency turbine less than 4.5 megawatts.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	The C200 includes the same low emissions, certification options, and flexible configuration features incorporated on our existing C30 and C65 products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P110_S2	Capstone signed an agreement with Carrier to provide cash and in-kind services to complete development and commercially launch the C200 product in September 2007.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P110_S3	Our C200 beta testing was successfully implemented during Fiscal 2005 and the first commercial shipment was on August 28, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine product line.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	This product family can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO container.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	Benefits of the C1000 Series product include low greenhouse-gas emissions, patented air-bearing microturbine technology, ease of installation and commissioning with a single fuel and electrical connection, minimal scheduled maintenance and downtime, low noise and vibration and one of the industry's smallest modular footprints.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	Additional features include Capstone's remote monitoring and diagnostic capabilities and integrated utility synchronization and protection.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P111_S4	Our C1000 product beta testing was successfully implemented during Fiscal 2009 and the first commercial shipment was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P112_S1	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	The world's first boat powered with an ultra low emission Capstone C30 microturbine launched in the Netherlands on June 7, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	This innovative onboard energy system features a Capstone C30 diesel fueled microturbine.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	In March 2009, we successfully demonstrated that our intercooled and recuperated ("ICR") microturbine produces emission levels that comply with the EPA and CARB 2010 requirements for heavy duty diesel engines and hybrid electric buses.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	Sales of heavy duty trucks and buses represent a major market opportunity, and, therefore, these applications have the potential to become a focused area for development if we can achieve the required performance and price levels.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	In December 2010, we released configurations of the C30 compressed natural gas ("CNG") microturbine that meet or exceed emissions standards, including the EPA and CARB 2010 requirements for heavy duty diesel engines for urban bus.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P116_S1	The C30 CNG microturbine is Capstone's second CARB certified engine for automotive applications; the C30 liquid fuel microturbine was certified in June 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	In July 2010, we successfully demonstrated a commercial concentrated solar power product converting sunlight to electricity with a solar receiver driving a C65 microturbine.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P117_S1	This renewable solution focuses enough sunlight energy to provide heat to drive the microturbine and offers higher solar conversion efficiencies over a traditional solar photovoltaic system.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	We are currently focusing efforts on a more efficient microturbine CHP system.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P118_S2	The first phase of the development program is expected to improve our existing C200 engine to increase power output and electrical efficiency, resulting in a system with a targeted power output of 250 kW and projected electrical efficiency of 35%.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P118_S3	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	The technology developed with the 370kW engine is directly applicable to the ICR microturbine targeted at the needs of the Class 8 truck market (trucks or tractor-trailers with a manufacturer's listed gross vehicle weight of 33,000 pounds or more).
1009759_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	In addition, we are developing and testing a fuel flexible microturbine system capable of operating on synthetic gas fuel mixtures containing varying amounts of hydrogen.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	The DOE awarded us a grant of $2.5 million in support of this development program.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 110 U.S. and 36 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_11_ITEM1_P121_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2014 and 2027.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P121_S3	These numbers include 24 U.S. patents and 3 international patents that were acquired from CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is an important component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long-term competitive advantage.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we had 195 employees.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.

1009759_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These financings may not be available, or if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements (the "Agreements") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, that provide us with a credit facility up to $10 million in the aggregate.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	At March 31, 2011, we had $7.1 million outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, we have pledged our accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral under the Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	At several times during Fiscal 2010, we were in noncompliance with certain covenants under the credit facility.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a condition of the amended Agreements, $5.0 million of cash was restricted in June 2010 as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	On November 9, 2010, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements that provides for the release by Wells Fargo of the $5.0 million in cash upon the Company's satisfaction of certain conditions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	During Fiscal 2011, Wells Fargo released $3.7 million of the restricted cash.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The remaining $1.3 million of cash was released in connection with the amendment to the Agreements on June 9, 2011 described below.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On March 25, 2011, we entered into a an amendment to the Agreements that allows the Company to form one wholly-owned subsidiary in each of Singapore and the United Kingdom provided that the amount of cash and cash equivalents that may be held by, or invested in each such subsidiary is within certain agreed upon limits.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This amendment also provides that, if requested by Wells Fargo, the Company will grant Wells Fargo a security interest in 65% of the equity interests of each subsidiary to secure indebtedness under the Agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we determined that we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding our net income.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	covenant as of March 31, 2011 and removed the net worth financial covenant for future periods.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Additionally, this amendment also established the financial covenants for Fiscal 2012 and authorized the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we had not obtained these waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs and obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a result, this would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Impairment charges on our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset with its carrying value.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	consumer reluctance to try a new product; regulatory requirements; the cost competitiveness of our microturbines; costs associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines; maintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines; the future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines; economic downturns and reduction in capital spending; consumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality; the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products; and decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We also outsource certain of our components internationally and expect to increase international outsourcing of components.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P31_S6	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Current economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Current economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the continued recession in economic activity.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we have and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors; product quality and performance; operating efficiency; product price; availability, price and compatibility of fuel; development of new products and features; and emissions levels.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We offer direct sales and service in selected markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We do not have extensive experience in providing direct sales and service and may not be successful in executing this strategy.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, we may lose existing distributors or service providers or we may have more difficulty attracting new distributors and service providers as a result of this strategy.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Further, we may incur new types of obligations, such as extended service obligations, that could result in costs that exceed the related revenue.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We may encounter new transaction types through providing direct sales and service and these transactions may require changes to our historic business practices.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P49_S5	For example, an arrangement with a third party leasing company may require us to provide a residual value guarantee, which is not consistent with our past operating practice.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and global economic or political instability.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Two of our top distributors are located in Russia and Belgium, and therefore we are particularly susceptible to risks associated with doing business in these two countries.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	BPC, a privately owned company located in Russia, accounted for approximately 26% of our net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2011 and approximately 23% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Verdesis, a Belgian distributor, accounted for approximately 10% of our net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2011 and approximately 4% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or the impact thereof on our operations or the market price of our common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective or that future material changes to our internal controls will be effective.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock or warrants.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenues from these relationships.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Activities necessary to integrate the acquisition of the microturbine business of CPS and any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We recently completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable as evidenced by days sales outstanding, or DSO, of 78 days as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	BPC and Pumps and Service accounted for approximately 23% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As of March 31, 2011, BPC and Pumps and Service represented 26% and 1% of net accounts receivable, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Loss of BPC, Pumps and Service or any other significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P69_S8	Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P72_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality or increase operating efficiency.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P78_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials, from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S3	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S4	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P86_S5	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Potential intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We may face litigation relating to intellectual property matters, labor matters, product liability, or other matters.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We are a party to stockholder lawsuits alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our June 2000 initial public offering and November 2000 secondary offering described under "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P90_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake-sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P95_S2	On August 23, 2010, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	February 22, 2011, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	On January 21, 2011, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that the closing bid price of our common stock had been $1.00 or greater for the previous ten consecutive business days and that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P96_S2	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P99_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and decreases in oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P101_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P101_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	We are currently subject to litigation relating to our initial public offering and a subsequent common stock offering as described under "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P102_S2	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right has been issued for each share of our common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Until the occurrence of certain prescribed events, the rights are not exercisable and are transferable along with, and only with, each share of our common stock and are evidenced by the common stock certificates.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P106_S2	One preferred stock purchase right will also be issued with each share of our common stock we issue in the future until the rights plan expires or is terminated or we redeem or exchange the rights for other property in accordance with the terms of the rights plan or at such time, if any, as the rights separate from each share of our common stock and become exercisable.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, dividends payable in cash in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends or other distributions, including non-cash dividends (payable in kind), declared on our common stock other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The rights plan prohibits the issuance of additional rights after the rights separate from our common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P108_S1	The rights plan is intended to protect our stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us.
1009759_11_ITEM1A_P108_S2	However, the existence of the rights plan may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of us that is not supported by our board of directors.
1009759_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our lease for those premises expires in July 2014, and we have two five-year options to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in nearby Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2012, and we have one five-year option to extend this lease.
1009759_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In December 2001, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company, two of its then officers, and the underwriters of our initial public offering.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The suit purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from June 28, 2000 to December 6, 2000.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	An amended complaint was filed on April 19, 2002.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	The plaintiffs allege that the prospectuses for our June 28, 2000 initial public offering and November 16, 2000 secondary offering were false and misleading in violation of the applicable securities laws because the prospectuses failed to disclose the underwriter defendants' alleged agreement to allocate stock in these offerings to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	Similar complaints have been filed against hundreds of other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998; the complaints have been consolidated into an action captioned In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 9, 2002, the plaintiffs dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against the named officers and directors in the action against the Company, pursuant to the terms of Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements entered into with the plaintiffs (the "Tolling Agreements").
1009759_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	Subsequent addenda to the Tolling Agreements extended the tolling period through August 27, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of "focus cases" and on October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	Our case is not one of these focus cases.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	The underwriter defendants appealed that ruling, and on December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's class certification decision.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended complaints against the six focus cases and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S4	On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus cases moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S5	On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P2_S6	The motion for class certification was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	On April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement between the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	The settlement "fairness" hearing was held on September 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	On October 6, 2009, the District Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the District Court close these actions.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	On August 26, 2010, based on the expiration of the tolling period stated in the Tolling Agreements, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Termination of Tolling Agreement and Recommencement of Litigation against the named officers and directors.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	The plaintiffs stated to the District Court that they do not intend to take any further action against the named officers and directors at this time.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	Appeals of the opinion granting final approval have been filed.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	outcome of the matter is uncertain.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	Management believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	On October 9, 2007, Vanessa Simmonds, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington(the "Washington District Court") against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Merrill Lynch Co., Inc., and Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriters of our initial public offering in June 1999, and our secondary offering of common stock in November 2000, alleging violations of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
1009759_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	The complaint sought to recover from the lead underwriters any "short swing profits" obtained by them in violation of Section 16(b).
1009759_11_ITEM3_P7_S2	The suit names the Company as a nominal defendant, contained no claims against the Company, and sought no relief from the Company.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	Simmonds filed an Amended Complaint on February 27, 2008 (the "Amended Complaint"), naming as defendants Goldman Sachs Co. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner Smith Inc. and again naming Morgan Stanley.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Co., Inc. were no longer named as defendants.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	The Amended Complaint asserted substantially similar claims as those set forth in the initial complaint.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S0	On July 25, 2008, the Company joined with 29 other issuers to file the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S1	Simmonds filed her opposition to this motion on September 8, 2008, and the Company and the other Issuer Defendants filed a Reply in Support of Their Joint Motion to Dismiss on October 23, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S2	On March 12, 2009, the Washington District Court granted the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that Simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on the Company prior to filing her complaint.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S3	In its order, the Washington District Court stated that it would not permit Simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S4	Because the Washington District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, it did not specifically reach the issue of whether Simmonds' claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P10_S5	However, the Washington District Court also granted the Underwriters' Joint Motion to Dismiss with respect to cases involving non-moving issuers, holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers' stockholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P11_S0	Simmonds filed a Notice of Appeal on April 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P11_S1	The underwriters subsequently filed a Notice of Cross Appeal, arguing that the dismissal of the claims involving the moving issuers should have been with prejudice because the claims were untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P12_S0	Simmonds filed her opening brief on appeal on August 26, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P12_S1	On October 2, 2009, the Company and other Issuer Defendants filed a joint response brief, and the underwriters filed a brief in support of their cross appeal.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P12_S2	Simmonds' reply brief and opposition to the cross appeal were filed on November 2, 2009 and the underwriters' reply brief in support of their cross appeals was filed on November 17, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P13_S0	On October 5, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit") heard oral arguments regarding this matter.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P13_S1	On December 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Washington District Court's decision to dismiss the moving issuers' cases (including the Company's) on the grounds that plaintiff's demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P13_S2	The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed and remanded the Washington District Court's decision on the underwriters' motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the non-moving issuers' initial public offerings, finding plaintiff's claims were not time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P13_S3	In remanding, the Ninth Circuit advised the non-moving issuers and underwriters to file in the Washington District Court the same challenges to plaintiff's demand letters that moving issuers had filed.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P14_S0	On December 16, 2010, the underwriters filed a petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P14_S1	Appellant Vanessa Simmonds also filed a petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P14_S2	On January 18, 2011, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P14_S3	It further ordered that no further petitions for rehearing may be filed.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P14_S4	On January 24, 2011, the underwriters filed a motion to stay the issuance of the Ninth Circuit's mandate in the cases involving the non-moving issuers.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P15_S0	involving the non-moving issuers is stayed for ninety days pending the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P16_S0	On January 26, 2011, Appellant Vanessa Simmonds moved to join the underwriters' motion and requested that the Ninth Circuit stay the mandate in all cases.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P16_S1	On January 26, 2011, the Ninth Circuit granted Appellant's motion and ruled that the mandate in all cases (including the Company's and other moving issuers) is stayed for ninety days pending Appellant's filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P17_S0	On April 5, 2011, plaintiff filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the adequacy of the pre-suit demand.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P17_S1	Plaintiff's petition was docketed by the Supreme Court on April 7, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P18_S0	On April 15, 2011, underwriter defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the statute of limitations issue.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P18_S1	Underwriter's petition was docketed by the Supreme Court on April 18, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P18_S2	On May 12, 2011, Vanessa Simmonds filed her Brief in Opposition to the underwriters' Petition.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P18_S3	On May 26, 2011, the moving issuer defendants filed their Brief in Opposition to Vanessa Simmonds' Petition, and on June 6, 2011, Vanessa Simmonds filed her reply to that Brief.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P18_S4	Management believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P19_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to additional legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1009759_11_ITEM3_P19_S1	Other than the matters discussed above, we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "CPST".
1009759_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the low and high sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 7, 2011, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $1.67 per share.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 7, 2011 there were 854 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant, including approval from Wells Fargo.
1009759_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data shown below have been derived from the audited financial statements of Capstone.
1009759_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM6_P0_S2	The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	Amounts in thousands, except per share data.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Annual Report.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is, and has been, the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We were able to significantly increase revenues again this year despite the challenging economic conditions worldwide.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Management believes that our efforts on the continued growth and broadening of our distribution network and the stronger than anticipated market acceptance of our new C1000 Series products were the primary reasons for our revenue growth.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, management believes that the oil gas, high rise buildings, biogas, UPS and hybrid electric vehicle markets can provide potential opportunities to Capstone in the near term.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Sales Marketing have significant experience in distributed generation and co-generation.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	They have successfully sold competing products, including GE Energy Jenbacher, Caterpillar Inc., Deutz Corporation, Waukesha gas engines and other microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Effective April 2011, we filled a newly created position of Senior Vice President of Program Management.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	This officer is responsible for the timely execution of our various research and development programs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products and delivery based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near-term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	On February 1, 2010, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company acquired, subject to an existing license retained by CPS, all of the rights and assets related to the manufacture and sale of the CPS 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine generator, including intellectual property, design, tooling, drawings, patents, know-how, distribution agreements and supply agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Pursuant to the APA, the Company issued to CPS 1,550,387 shares of common stock at the closing date on February 1, 2010 and agreed to pay additional consideration of $3.1 million on July 30, 2010 (the "Second Funding Date").
1009759_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	The additional consideration was to be paid, at the Company's discretion, in shares of the Company's common stock or cash.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	The Company elected to satisfy the amount due on the Second Funding Date with common stock and issued 3,131,313 shares to CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	On April 28, 2011, we purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	On the closing date of February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements during a three-year period, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	We must meet specified annual sales targets in order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell the waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	In order to increase volume and reduce cost, we focus our efforts in vertical markets that we expect to generate repeat business for the Company.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	1) Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	During Fiscal 2011, we booked orders for 91.9 megawatts and shipped 69.7 megawatts of products, resulting in 118.6 megawatts in backlog at the end of the fiscal year.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our actual product shipments in Fiscal 2011 were: 41% for use in energy efficiency applications, 14% for use in renewable energy applications, 39% for use in natural resources applications and 6% for use in other applications (including critical power supply and mobile products).
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	2) Sales and Distribution Channel We seek out distributors and representatives that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In North America, we currently have 36 distributors and OEMs, which include six distributors added as a result of the CPS transaction.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Internationally, outside of North America, we currently have 61 distributors and OEMs, which include 11 distributors added as a result of the CPS transaction.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We continue to refine the distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	3) Service We serve our customers directly and through qualified distributors, who will perform their service work using technicians specifically trained by Capstone.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	We offer a comprehensive FPP where Capstone charges a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled maintenance, as well as other maintenance as needed.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	Capstone then performs the required maintenance directly with its own personnel, or contracts with one of its local distributors to do so.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P11_S7	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Individuals who are certified are called ASPs and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2011 was $29.7 million which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2026.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	Service revenue in Fiscal 2011 was approximately 8% of total revenue.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	4) Product Robustness and Life Cycle Maintenance Costs To provide us with the ability to evaluate microturbine performance in the field, we developed a "real-time" remote monitoring and diagnostic feature.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	This feature allows us to monitor installed units and rapidly collect operating data on a continual basis.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	We use this information to anticipate and more quickly respond to field performance issues, evaluate component robustness and identify areas for continuous improvement.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	This feature is important in allowing us to better serve our customers.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, TA100, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P13_S6	Our product development efforts are centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We are currently focusing efforts on developing a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	development program is expected to improve our existing C200 engine to increase power output and electrical efficiency, resulting in a system with a targeted power output of 250 kW and projected electrical efficiency of 35%.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	In addition, we are developing and testing a fuel flexible microturbine system capable of operating on synthetic gas fuel mixtures containing varying amounts of hydrogen.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	6) Cost and Core Competencies We are continuing to make progress towards achieving cost improvement goals through design and manufacturability changes, robotics, parts commonality, tier one suppliers and lower cost offshore suppliers.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	We have made progress and plan to continue diversifying our suppliers internationally and within the United States.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management also expects to be able to continue leveraging our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone's promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we ship approximately 200 units in a quarter, depending on an assumed product mix.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1009759_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long-lived assets, including intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The estimated fair value of the assets are determined using the best information available, which generally is an estimate of the future discounted cash flow associated with the assets using a discount rate that approximates the weighted-average cost of capital for the Company.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, trade name, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	A significant assumption in our forecasts is our ability to reduce our direct material costs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Based on our current forecasts, if we were not able to achieve additional significant cost reductions, our estimated undiscounted cash flows may not exceed the carrying value of our long-lived assets, which could result in a future impairment of our long-lived assets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2011 and determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying value of the assets and no write-down was necessary.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our inventories are valued at first in first out ("FIFO") and lower of cost or market.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write-downs of inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long-term based on our sales forecast.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess expected warranty costs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S6	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P32_S7	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, net of discounts.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our distributors purchase products and parts for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	For multiple-element arrangements, we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, the Company's estimated selling price of each element is known and customer acceptance, if required, has occurred.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We allocate the total contract value among each element based on its relative selling price.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days or past payment terms.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is "more likely than not" that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily state taxes.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred income tax asset at that time.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Accounting for contingencies, such as legal matters, requires us to use our judgment.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Any unfavorable outcome of litigation or other contingencies could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The use of Black Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The term "forfeitures" is distinct from "cancellations" or "expirations" and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	We re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	Ultimately, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	As discussed in Note 9 Fair Value Measurements in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements", ASC 815 requires that our warrants be accounted for as derivative instruments and that we mark the value of our warrant liability to market and recognize the change in valuation in our statement of operations each reporting period.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Determining the warrant liability to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of the warrants.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	We calculate the fair values using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the contractual life of the warrants, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the warrant contractual life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Revenue for Fiscal 2011 increased $20.3 million, or 33%, to $81.9 million from $61.6 million for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010 included a $13.4 million increase in revenue from the North American market, a $12.2 million increase in revenue from the European market and a $2.4 million increase in revenue from the Asian market, all primarily the result of efforts to improve distribution channels.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	This overall increase in revenue was offset by a $5.1 million decrease in revenue from the Australian market, $2.2 million decrease in revenue from the South American market and a $0.4 million decrease in revenue from the African market because of lower order volume in these regions.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	For Fiscal 2011, revenue from microturbine products increased $17.6 million , or 36%, to $66.3 million from $48.7 million for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Overall microturbine product shipments were 112 units (16.9 megawatts) higher during Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010, totaling 611 units (69.7 megawatts) and 499 units (52.8 megawatts), respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	Megawatts shipped and revenue during Fiscal 2011 increased as a result of higher sales volume of our C65 microturbine, the introduction of our new TA100, the sale of ten microturbine rental units and further market adoption of our C200 and C1000 Series product lines.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Average revenue per unit increased for Fiscal 2011 to approximately $109,000 compared to approximately $98,000 for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	For Fiscal 2011, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $2.7 million, or 21%, to $15.6 million from $12.9 million for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales of microturbine parts and FPP contracts.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	For Fiscal 2011, a shortage in certain key parts delayed our ability to ship products as scheduled.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer payments and customer delivery schedules), some of which are not in our control and can affect our revenue and backlog.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	As a result of such issues, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Sales to BPC accounted for 23% and 14% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Sales to Pumps and Service accounted for 18% and 4% our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	Sales to Aquatec accounted for 4% and 14% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The gross loss was $0.5 million, or 1% of revenue, for Fiscal 2011 compared to a gross loss of $8.4 million, or 14% of revenue, for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The improvement in gross loss of $7.9 million was the result of $10.2 million related to a change in product mix.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	In addition, we sold more microturbine products and increased parts and FPP sales during Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	The C200 and C1000 series systems had better margins than in the same period last year as a result of higher average selling prices and lower direct materials costs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	The $10.2 million improvement in gross loss related to product mix was offset by an increase in production and service center labor and overhead expenses of $1.5 million and warranty expense of $0.8 million.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Management has implemented certain initiatives to further reduce direct material costs and other manufacturing and warranty costs as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense increased $1.5 million during Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010 as the result of part shortages and service center repairs of the C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Reliability repair programs are estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	the standard warranty provision of $1.5 million as a result of higher sales volume during Fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year period.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	In addition, it also reflects a decrease of $0.7 million in the warranty expense relating to a benefit in reliability repair program reductions in Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	We had R D expenses of approximately $7.0 million during each of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants and Carrier funding.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	There were approximately $0.9 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2011 and $1.7 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	During Fiscal 2011, benefits from cost-sharing programs decreased $0.8 million, offset by lower spending for salaries of $0.4 million and consulting expense of $0.4 million.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Carrier cost-sharing program concluded in June 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phases of the programs.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Management expects R D costs in Fiscal 2012 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Selling, General and Administrative ("SG A") Expenses.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Other income was $32,000 during Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	This other income was primarily the result of our closure of certain offices that we held in Italy.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The decrease in interest income was attributable to a general decline in market interest rates that resulted in lower yields earned on our cash and cash equivalents in comparison to interest income in the same period last year.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Management expects interest income in Fiscal 2012 to be higher than in Fiscal 2011 as we continue to invest cash from our operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 29%, to $0.9 million for Fiscal 2011 from $0.7 million for Fiscal 2010.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	This change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of warrant exercises, revaluing the warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, impacted primarily by the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	The revaluation of the warrant liability has no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Income taxes during Fiscal 2011 increased $0.3 million to a tax expense of $0.2 million from a tax benefit of $0.1 million during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in income taxes was related to foreign taxes of $0.5 million reduced by a R D tax credit of $0.2 million that was received during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The effective income tax rate of .63% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of 39.51% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	At March 31, 2011, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $576.7 million and $301.6 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	net deferred tax asset of $231.0 million at March 31, 2011 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	This overall increase in revenue was offset by a $2.9 million decrease in revenue from the North American market because of lower sales volume to one of our customers and because Fiscal 2009 included unusually large sales to two customers.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Overall microturbine product shipments were slightly higher during Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009 totaling 499 units (52.8 megawatts) and 494 units (34.1 megawatts) respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	Megawatts shipped and revenue during Fiscal 2010 increased as a result of the introduction of our new TA100, C200 and C1000 Series product lines.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The average revenue per unit increased to $98,000 in Fiscal 2010 compared to $66,000 per unit for Fiscal 2009 year because of the benefit of a full twelve months of sales of higher priced C200 and C1000 Series systems, which were introduced during Fiscal 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer payments and customer delivery schedules), some of which are not within our control and can affect our revenue and backlog.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Sales to BPC accounted for 14% and 13% of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Fiscal 2010, which had a lower margin in Fiscal 2010 than our overall average margin mix from Fiscal 2009, as a result of low introductory pricing and initially higher than planned product cost.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	This was offset by a decrease in our production and service center overhead of $1.0 million.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The increase in warranty expense of $2.3 million consisted of a $1.9 million increase for warranty repairs related to C200 and C1000 Series systems, where early production units operating at customer sites were updated for improvements, as the product matured during the year and the increase in the per-unit warranty accrual because of the increased volume of C200 and C1000 Series systems in the field.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	In addition, the $2.3 million increase also included a $0.4 million increase in warranty programs compared to the prior period because of a higher benefit recorded in the prior period because of warranty program reductions for units subsequently covered by factory protection plans and our expectation that units will operate beyond the estimated warranty failure period.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The increase in inventory charges of $1.2 million was because of charges related to scrap in the manufacturing process of the C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	These charges were offset by decreased production and service center overhead of $1.0 million.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The reduction in overhead was a result of our production cost reduction efforts, primarily related to the decrease in manufacturing personnel.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	R D expenses during Fiscal 2010 decreased $1.1 million, or 14%, to $7.0 million from $8.1 million during Fiscal 2009.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	There were approximately $1.7 million of such benefits during Fiscal 2010 and $8.1 million of such benefits during Fiscal 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	There were no in-kind services performed under the cost-sharing programs during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	In-kind services performed during Fiscal 2009 were valued at $0.2 million and recorded as consulting expenses.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P80_S5	The overall decrease in R D expenses of $1.1 million resulted from decreased spending for consulting expenses of $2.4 million, supplies of $2.4 million, salary expense of $1.3 million, facilities expense of $1.3 million and travel expense of $0.1 million, offset by reduced Carrier funding benefits of $6.4 million for the cost-sharing program, which concluded in June 2009.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Interest income during Fiscal 2010 decreased to $8,000 from $0.5 million during Fiscal 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The decrease during the period was attributable to lower average cash balances and less cash held in interest-bearing accounts.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Interest expense during Fiscal 2010 increased to $0.7 million from $0.1 million during Fiscal 2009.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	This change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of revaluing the warrant liability, impacted primarily by the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P85_S5	This revaluation has no impact on the Company's cash balances.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Income taxes during Fiscal 2010 decreased $0.2 million to a tax benefit of $0.1 million from a tax expense of $0.1 million during Fiscal 2009.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	Immediately prior to the exercise of these warrants, we revalued the warrants and recorded a charge of $6.9 million to operations during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	In connection with the induced exercise of the warrants, we modified the warrant agreements, which resulted in a reduction of the charge to operations by $1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The funds generated from financing activities during Fiscal 2010 were primarily the result of an underwritten offering, a warrant exercise transaction and issuance of new warrants and a registered offering of our common stock and warrants, which were completed effective February 24, 2010, September 17, 2009 and May 7, 2009, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	The underwritten offering resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $46.0 million and proceeds net of direct transaction costs of $42.4 million.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Employee stock purchases, net of repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units, resulted in approximately $40,000 of net cash generated during Fiscal 2011, compared with $0.1 million of net cash during Fiscal 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	During Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, we generated additional financing from the Credit Facility by drawing down our line of credit when funds were available.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements (the "Agreements") with Wells Fargo.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	The amount actually available to us may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, we granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of our assets.

1009759_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we were in noncompliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	As a result of our non-compliance with the financial covenant in the Agreements regarding our net income as of March 31, 2010, Wells Fargo imposed default pricing of an additional 3.0% effective March 1, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	In addition, as a condition of the further amendment of the Agreements, Wells Fargo restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 11, 2010 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	On June 29, 2010, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to amend the financial covenant related to capital expenditures by adding a limitation on expenditures for Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Under the terms of this amendment, we may not incur or contract to incur capital expenditures of more than (i) $4.5 million in the aggregate during Fiscal 2011, and (ii) zero for each subsequent year until the Company and Wells Fargo agree on limits on capital expenditures for subsequent periods based on management's projections for such periods.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	On November 9, 2010, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to provide for the release by Wells Fargo of the $5.0 million in cash restricted since June 2010 upon the Company's satisfaction of certain conditions.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	During Fiscal 2011, Wells Fargo released $3.7 million of the restricted cash.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	On March 25, 2011 we entered into a an amendment to the Agreements that allows the Company to form one wholly-owned subsidiary in each of Singapore and the United Kingdom provided that the amount of cash and cash equivalents that may be held by, or invested in each such subsidiary is within certain agreed upon limits.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	This amendment also provides that, if requested by Wells Fargo, the Company will grant Wells Fargo a security interest in 65% of the equity interests of each subsidiary to secure indebtedness under the Agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we determined that we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding our net income.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	On June 9, 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of our noncompliance with the financial covenant as of March 31, 2011, and removed the net worth financial covenant for future periods.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	Additionally, this amendment also set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2012 and authorized the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	Based on our current forecasts, management believes we will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for the next twelve months.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Although we have made progress on direct material cost reduction efforts, we were behind schedule in reducing costs at the end of Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Further, we have not been able to fully achieve our planned number of product shipments partly as a result of shortages from certain key suppliers.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	If we are unable to improve our performance in the areas discussed above and successfully meet our financial covenant, we may need to raise additional funds in the near term.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S3	We could seek to raise such funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S4	We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S5	If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced (on a fully diluted basis in the case of convertible securities).
1009759_11_ITEM7_P113_S6	In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Depending on the timing and product mix of our future sales and collection of related receivables, our management of inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the current backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve dramatically increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	the market acceptance of our products and services; our business, product and capital expenditure plans; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; our competitors' response to our products and services; our relationships with customers, distributors, dealers and project resellers; and our customers' ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	Additionally, the continued credit difficulties in the markets could prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable as evidenced by days sales outstanding, or DSO, of 78 days as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P117_S4	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas may have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the recession in economic activity.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans or obtain additional financing that might be needed if our cash needs change, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	At March 31, 2011, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:
1009759_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $21.5 million through Fiscal 2014.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we agreed to purchase for cash any remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and was not considered excess or obsolete and to acquire certain TA100 manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	On April 28, 2011, we purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	As of March 31, 2011, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable for the Credit Facility is $31,000 each calendar month.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on February 9, 2012 unless terminated sooner.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-17, Revenue Recognition Milestone Method ("ASU 2010-17").
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	ASU 2010-17 provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	A vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	The following criteria must be met for a milestone to be considered substantive.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S4	The consideration earned by achieving the milestone should be: (1) commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor's performance to achieve the milestone; (2) related solely to past performance and (3) reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P125_S5	No split of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Accordingly, an arrangement may contain both substantive and non-substantive milestones.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	ASU 2010-17 is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	We adopted this updated guidance with no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	In September 2009, the FASB issued updated guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, "Revenue Recognition," for establishing the criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and requires companies allocating the overall consideration to each deliverable to use an estimated selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverables.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	The updated guidance also provides additional factors that should be considered when determining whether software in a tangible product is essential to its functionality.
1009759_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	We adopted this updated guidance with no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we anticipate entering into more transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we had $7.1 million outstanding under our Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A hypothetical 2% change in interest rates would not have any effect on our payments because interest on our Credit Facility balance of $7.1 million as of March 31, 2011 would still be lower than the minimum interest payment of approximately $31,000 each calendar month payable pursuant to the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Annual Report beginning at page F-1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2011, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2011 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The report of Deloitte Touch LLP follows.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended March 31, 2011 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated June 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph regarding Capstone Turbine Corporation's adoption of the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , effective April 1, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On June 9, 2011, our Board of Directors unanimously approved a second amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the Rights Agreement, dated July 7, 2005, between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC (as amended, the "Rights Agreement").
1009759_11_ITEM9B_P0_S1	The Rights Agreement, as amended, will be submitted for approval by the Company's stockholders at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders.
1009759_11_ITEM9B_P1_S0	The Second Amendment adds an additional "sunset provision," which provides that the Rights Agreement will expire on the 30th day after the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders unless continuation of the Rights Agreement is approved by the stockholders at that meeting.
1009759_11_ITEM9B_P1_S1	The Second Amendment also provides for an update to the definition of "Beneficial Owner" to include derivative interests in the calculation of a stockholder's ownership.
1009759_11_ITEM9B_P1_S2	In addition, the Second Amendment clarifies the manner in which the exchange provision of the Rights Agreement shall be effected.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	In addition, the Company's microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company was organized in 1988 and has been commercially producing its microturbine generators since 1998.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	Management anticipates incurring additional losses until the Company can produce sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	To date, the Company has funded its activities primarily through private and public equity offerings.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the Company had $106.4 million, or 669 units, in backlog, all of which are expected to be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	However, the timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer payments and changes in customer delivery schedules), some of which are beyond the Company's control and can affect the Company's revenue and backlog.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P27_S3	Although the Company has made progress on direct material cost reduction efforts, the Company was behind schedule in reducing costs at the end of Fiscal 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P27_S4	Further, the Company has not been able to fully achieve its planned number of product shipments partly as a result of shortages from certain suppliers.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	If the Company is unable to improve its performance in the areas discussed above and meet its financial covenants with Wells Fargo as further described under Note 10 Revolving Credit Facility in this Form 10-K, the Company may need to raise additional funds in the near term.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company could seek to raise such funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining debt financing.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P28_S3	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P28_S4	In addition, any equity or debt securities that it would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Should the Company be unable to execute its plans or obtain additional financing that might be needed if the Company's cash needs change, the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revolving credit facility and notes payable approximate fair market value based on their short-term nature.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	See Note 9 Fair Value Measurements, for disclosure regarding the fair value of financial instruments.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	Accounts Receivable The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Inventories The Company values inventories at first in first out ("FIFO") and lower of cost or market.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	The composition of inventory is routinely evaluated to identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P36_S3	Included in the assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in the Company's products.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	All inventories expected to be used in more than one year are classified as long-term.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from two to ten years.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method with the exception of the backlog of 100 kW microturbines ("TA100") acquired from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	Purchased backlog is amortized based on unit sales.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	If the expected future cash flows from the use of such assets (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, the Company may be required to record a write-down, which is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2011 and determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying value of the assets and no write-down was necessary.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, trade name, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of deferred product and service revenue and customer deposits.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	Deferred revenue will be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Revenue The Company's revenue consists of sales of products, parts and accessories and service, net of discounts.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	Capstone's distributors purchase products and parts for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning repair and maintenance service.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company's standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end-users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by Capstone except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P44_S3	Revenue is generally recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	Service performed by the Company has consisted primarily of commissioning and time and materials based contracts.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	The time and materials contracts are usually related to out-of-warranty units.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as performed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company also provides maintenance service contracts to customers of its existing install base.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S5	The maintenance service contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed-upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S6	Service revenue derived from maintenance service contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S7	The Company occasionally enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as sale of equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S8	For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand- alone value to the customer, the Company's estimated selling price of each element is known and customer acceptance provisions, if any, have occurred.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P45_S9	The Company allocates the total contract value among each element based on their relative selling prices.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Warranty The Company provides for the estimated costs of warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold, geography of sale and the length of extended warranties sold.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	The Company's product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to eighteen months.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S3	Factors that affect the Company's warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S4	These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P46_S5	Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company's judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company accounts for grant distributions and development funding as offsets to R D expenses and both are recorded as the related costs are incurred.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	Total offsets to R D expenses amounted to $0.9 million, $1.7 million and $8.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Contingencies The Company records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Risk Concentrations Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P54_S5	Additionally, BPC and Verdesis S.A. ("Verdesis"), the Company's Belgian distributor, accounted for 26% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Several components of the Company's products are available from a limited number of suppliers.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	An interruption in supply could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which would affect operating results adversely.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	Significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, inventory write-downs, valuation of long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite lives, product warranties, income taxes and other contingencies.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P56_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P137_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P137_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P137_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. treasury funds at March 31, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy(in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	As the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	computed using a discounted cash flow model using estimated market rates.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted the amended provisions of ASC 815 on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in ASC 815.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	Warrants issued by the Company in prior periods with certain anti-dilution provisions for the holder are no longer considered indexed to the Company's own stock, and therefore no longer qualify for the scope exception and must be accounted for as derivatives.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P149_S2	These warrants were reclassified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P149_S3	The Company will continue to adjust the warrant liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, at which time the liability will be reclassified to stockholders' equity, or expiration of the warrants.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P149_S4	On April 1, 2009, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment based on the grant date fair value of the warrants issued in September 2008 and January 2007 that were outstanding at April 1, 2009 and the change in fair value of the warrant liability through April 1, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company recorded the following cumulative effect of change in accounting principle pursuant to its adoption of the amendment as of April 1, 2009 (in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	During the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company sold and issued additional warrants that provide certain anti-dilution protections for the Holders.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	See Note 8 Stockholders' Equity Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock for further discussion.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	The fair value of the Company's warrant liability (see Note 8 Stockholders' Equity Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock) recorded in the Company's financial statements is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method and the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market, a Level 3 measurement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	the fair value of the warrant liability as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy; however, the Company has reclassified such warrant liability as Level 3 for all periods presented because the Company's fair value determination was made using significant unobservable inputs.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	Volatility is based on the actual market activity of the Company's stock.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P154_S1	The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants' expected life.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	From time to time, the Company sells common stock warrants that are derivative instruments.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	As discussed above, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on contracts in an entity's own equity that requires the common stock warrants to be classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value at each reporting date recognized in the statement of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	Prior to April 1, 2009, none of the assets and liabilities of the Company included in the consolidated balance sheets were measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P158_S1	The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liability which is measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements (the "Agreements") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P159_S1	The Agreements provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $10 million in the aggregate (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P159_S2	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	As of March 31, 2010, the Company had a standby letter of credit for one of its customers in the amount of $0.5 million.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P160_S2	This letter of credit limits the amount the Company can borrow on its Credit Facility with Wells Fargo.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P160_S3	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on February 9, 2012 unless terminated sooner.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit the Company's ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company's capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, (f) change the Company's accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P161_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (a) a requirement to maintain a specified minimum book worth, (b) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (c) a requirement to maintain a specified ratio of minimum cash balances to unreimbursed line of credit advances, and (d) limitations on the Company's capital expenditures.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, the Company was in noncompliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	As a result of the Company's non-compliance with the financial covenant in the Agreements regarding the Company's net income as of March 31, 2010, Wells Fargo imposed default pricing of an additional 3.0% effective March 1, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P163_S1	In addition, as a condition of the further amendment of the Agreements, Wells Fargo restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 11, 2010 as additional security for the Credit Facility.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P166_S1	This amendment also provides that, if requested by Wells Fargo, the Company will grant Wells Fargo a security interest in 65% of the equity interests of each subsidiary to secure indebtedness under the Agreements.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding net income.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P167_S1	On June 9, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of the Company's noncompliance with this financial covenant as of March 31, 2011 and removed the net worth financial covenant for future periods.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P167_S2	Additionally, this amendment also set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2012 and authorized the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, the Company would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P168_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P168_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P168_S3	Based on the Company's current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for the next twelve months.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P169_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the greater of the Prime Rate plus applicable margin or 5% plus applicable margin, subject to a minimum interest floor.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	Based on the revolving nature of the Company's borrowings and payments, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $31,000 per month.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $21.5 million through Fiscal 2014.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P173_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable upon the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	The Company leases offices and manufacturing facilities under various non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S1	All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S2	The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and renewal options for five-year periods.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S3	Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S4	The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P174_S5	The balance of deferred rent was approximately $0.3 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P181_S3	The related automobiles collateralize the notes payable.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	On April 28, 2011, the Company purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P182_S1	See Note 14 Acquisition, for discussion of commitments associated with the MPL acquired from CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	In September 2010, the Company was awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") for the research, development and testing of a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	Part of the improved efficiency will come from an improved microturbine design, with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and power output of 370 kW. The project is estimated to last 24 months and cost approximately $17.4 million.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	The DOE will contribute $5.0 million toward the project, and the Company will incur approximately $12.4 million in research and development expense.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	Agreements the Company has with some of its distributors require that if the Company renders parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then the Company is required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	Company if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	As of March 31, 2011, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	In December 2001, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company, two of its then officers, and the underwriters of the Company's initial public offering.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	The suit purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock during the period from June 28, 2000 to December 6, 2000.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P187_S2	An amended complaint was filed on April 19, 2002.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P187_S3	The plaintiffs allege that the prospectuses for the Company's June 28, 2000 initial public offering and November 16, 2000 secondary offering were false and misleading in violation of the applicable securities laws because the prospectuses failed to disclose the underwriter defendants' alleged agreement to allocate stock in these offerings to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P187_S4	Similar complaints have been filed against hundreds of other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998; the complaints have been consolidated into an action captioned In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	On October 9, 2002, the plaintiffs dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against the named officers and directors in the action against the Company, pursuant to the terms of Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements entered into with the plaintiffs (the "Tolling Agreements").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	Subsequent addenda to the Tolling Agreements extended the tolling period through August 27, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of "focus cases" and on October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company's case is not one of these focus cases.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S2	The underwriter defendants appealed that ruling, and on December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's class certification decision.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S3	On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended complaints against the six focus cases and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S4	On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus cases moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S5	On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P189_S6	The motion for class certification was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	On April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement between the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P190_S1	The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	The settlement "fairness" hearing was held on September 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P191_S1	On October 6, 2009, the District Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the District Court close these actions.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	On August 26, 2010, based on the expiration of the tolling period stated in the Tolling Agreements, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Termination of Tolling Agreement and Recommencement of Litigation against the named officers and directors.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P192_S1	The plaintiffs stated to the District Court that they do not intend to take any further action against the named officers and directors at this time.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P192_S2	Appeals of the opinion granting final approval have been filed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P192_S3	Because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the settlement remains subject to appeal, the ultimate outcome of the matter is uncertain.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P192_S4	Management believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	On October 9, 2007, Vanessa Simmonds, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (the "Washington District Court") against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Merrill Lynch Co., Inc., and Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriters of the Company's initial public offering in June 1999, and the Company's secondary offering of common stock in November 2000, alleging violations of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	The complaint sought to recover from the lead underwriters any "short-swing profits" obtained by them in violation of Section 16(b).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P193_S2	The suit names the Company as a nominal defendant, contained no claims against the Company, and sought no relief from the Company.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	Simmonds filed an Amended Complaint on February 27, 2008 (the "Amended Complaint"), naming as defendants Goldman Sachs Co. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner Smith Inc. and again naming Morgan Stanley.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P194_S1	The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Co., Inc. were no longer named as defendants.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Amended Complaint asserted substantially similar claims as those set forth in the initial complaint.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	On July 25, 2008, the Company joined with 29 other issuers to file the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S1	Simmonds filed her opposition to this motion on September 8, 2008, and the Company and the other Issuer Defendants filed a Reply in Support of Their Joint Motion to Dismiss on October 23, 2008.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S2	On March 12, 2009, the Washington District Court granted the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that Simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on the Company prior to filing her complaint.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S3	In its order, the Washington District Court stated that it would not permit Simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S4	Because the Washington District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, it did not specifically reach the issue of whether Simmonds' claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P196_S5	However, the Washington District Court also granted the Underwriters' Joint Motion to Dismiss with respect to cases involving non-moving issuers, holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers' stockholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	Simmonds filed a Notice of Appeal on April 10, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	The underwriters subsequently filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, arguing that the dismissal of the claims involving the moving issuers should have been with prejudice because the claims were untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	Simmonds filed her opening brief on appeal on August 26, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	On October 2, 2009, the Company and other Issuer Defendants filed a joint response brief, and the underwriters filed a brief in support of their cross-appeal.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P198_S2	Simmonds' reply brief and opposition to the cross-appeal were filed on November 2, 2009 and the underwriters' reply brief in support of their cross-appeals was filed on November 17, 2009.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	On October 5, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit") heard oral arguments regarding this matter.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	On December 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Washington District Court's decision to dismiss the moving issuers' cases (including the Company's) on the grounds that plaintiff's demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P199_S2	The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed and remanded the Washington District Court's decision on the underwriters' motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the non-moving issuers' initial public offerings, finding plaintiff's claims were not time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P199_S3	In remanding, the Ninth Circuit advised the non-moving issuers and underwriters to file in the Washington District Court the same challenges to plaintiff's demand letters that moving issuers had filed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	On December 16, 2010, the underwriters filed a petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	Appellant Vanessa Simmonds also filed a petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P200_S2	On January 18, 2011, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	petitions for rehearing may be filed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	On January 24, 2011, the underwriters filed a motion to stay the issuance of the Ninth Circuit's mandate in the cases involving the non-moving issuers.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	On January 25, 2011, the Ninth Circuit granted the underwriters' motion and ordered that the mandate in the cases involving the non-moving issuers is stayed for ninety days pending the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	On January 26, 2011, Appellant Vanessa Simmonds moved to join the underwriters' motion and requested that the Ninth Circuit stay the mandate in all cases.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P207_S1	The Development Agreement engaged UTCP to fund and support the Company's continued development and commercialization of the Company's 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbine.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	In return, the Company agreed to pay to UTCP an ongoing royalty of 10% of the sales price of the C200 sold to customers other than UTCP until the aggregate of UTCP's cash and in-kind services investment had been recovered and, thereafter, the royalty would be reduced to 5% of the sales price.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P208_S1	In August 2009, the Development Agreement was assigned by UTCP to Carrier Corporation ("Carrier").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company recorded the benefits from this Development Agreement as a reduction of research and development ("R D") expenses.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P209_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2010, the Company recognized approximately $1.3 million of such benefits and there were no in-kind services for the year ended March 31, 2010.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P209_S5	The program concluded in June 2009 and, therefore, there was no funding in excess of expenses recorded in Other Current Liabilities as of March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P209_S6	The reduction of R D expenses was recognized on a percentage of completion basis, limited by the amount of funding received and/or earned based on milestone deliverables.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P210_S0	On January 14, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P210_S1	The amendment amends the royalty payment from a certain percentage of the sales prices to a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by the amendment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P210_S2	Carrier earned $1.9 million and $1.5 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during the year ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P213_S1	The Company elected to satisfy the amount due on the Second Funding Date with common stock and issued 3,131,313 shares to CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P213_S2	This liability was recorded at fair value on the Closing Date and was accreted to its full settlement value at the Second Funding Date by recording the increase to interest expense.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P214_S0	The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P214_S1	The Company incurred $0.1 million of costs during Fiscal 2010 related to the acquisition of the MPL.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P214_S2	These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P217_S0	Acquired intangible assets have estimated useful lives between one and ten years.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P217_S1	The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired has been determined primarily by using the income approach.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P218_S0	Purchased identifiable intangible assets, except for backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives and classified as a component of cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses based on the function of the underlying asset.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P218_S1	Backlog is amortized on a per unit basis as the backlog units are sold and presented as a component of cost of goods sold.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P219_S0	The financial results of the MPL have been included in the Company's Statements of Operations commencing on the Closing Date.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P219_S1	Total revenue and net loss generated from the MPL subsequent to the Closing Date were $1.3 million and $32,500, respectively.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P220_S0	financial information presents the results as if the MPL acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each year (in thousands):
1009759_11_ITEM15_P221_S0	On the Closing Date, the Company and CPS entered into a manufacturing supply agreement under which CPS would continue to manufacture the TA100 microturbines for the Company through March 31, 2011 (the "Transition Period").
1009759_11_ITEM15_P221_S1	During the Transition Period, CPS leased from the Company on a royalty-free basis the intellectual property required to manufacture TA100 microturbines.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P222_S0	The Company agreed to purchase for cash at the end of the Transition Period any remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and was not considered excess or obsolete and to obtain title to certain TA100 manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P222_S1	The manufacturing equipment is accounted for as a capital lease at the acquisition date under ASC 840 "Leases" and recorded at fair value.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P223_S0	On April 28, 2011, the Company purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P224_S0	On the Closing Date, the Company also entered into an agreement with CPS to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P224_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements during a three-year period, the Company has exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P224_S2	The Company must meet specified annual sales targets in order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell the waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P224_S3	The OEM agreement is being treated as a separate transaction from the MPL acquisition.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P279_S1	Except as expressly amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P280_S0	This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P280_S1	A facsimile signature shall be considered the same as an original signature for purposes of execution of this Amendment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P281_S0	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Amendment No. 2 to Rights Agreement to be executed as of the date first above written.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P282_S0	On July 5, 2005, the Board of Directors (the Board ) of Capstone Turbine Corporation, (the Company ) authorized a dividend distribution of one Right for each authorized and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock ), of the Company to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 18, 2005 (the Record Date ).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P282_S1	Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share (a Unit ) of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ) at a Purchase Price of $10.00 per Unit, subject to adjustment.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P282_S2	The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement, as amended (the Rights Agreement ) between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P282_S3	Terms used but not defined in this summary have the meanings ascribed to them in the Rights Agreement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P283_S0	Initially, the Rights will be attached to all Common Stock certificates representing shares then outstanding, and no separate Rights Certificates will be distributed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P283_S1	Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the Common Stock and a Distribution Date will occur upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person ) has subject to certain exceptions acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the Stock Acquisition Date ), other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by institutional or certain other stockholders, or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as the Board shall determine) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P284_S0	Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be represented by Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates, (ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Stock outstanding will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P285_S0	Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Company reserves the right to require prior to the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as defined below) that, upon any exercise of Rights, a number of Rights be exercised so that only whole shares of Preferred Stock will be issued.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P286_S0	The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at 5:00 P.M. (California time) on July 18, 2015, unless such date is extended or the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described below (including by virtue of the sunset provision ).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P287_S0	As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Rights Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and, thereafter, the separate Rights Certificates alone will represent the Rights.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P287_S1	Except as otherwise determined by the Board, only shares of Common Stock issued prior to the Distribution Date will be issued with Rights.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P288_S0	In the event that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, in lieu of the fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, that number of shares of Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P289_S0	Person will be null and void.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P289_S1	However, Rights are not exercisable following the occurrence of the event set forth above until such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable by the Company as set forth below.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P290_S0	For example, at an exercise price of $10.00 per Right, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person (or by certain related parties) following an event set forth in the preceding paragraph would entitle its holder to purchase $20.00 worth of Common Stock (or other consideration, as noted above) for $10.00.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P290_S1	Assuming that the Common Stock had a per share value of $1.00 at such time, the holder of each valid Right would be entitled to purchase twenty shares of Common Stock for $10.00.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P291_S0	In the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, (i) the Company engages in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, (ii) the Company engages in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is the surviving corporation and the Common Stock of the Company is changed or exchanged, or (iii) 50% or more of the Company s assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right (except Rights which have previously been voided as set forth above) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P292_S0	The events set forth in this paragraph and in the second preceding paragraph are referred to as the Triggering Events.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P293_S0	At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding Common Stock, the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a class or series of the Company s preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), per Right (subject to adjustment).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P294_S0	At any time until ten days following the Stock Acquisition Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (payable in cash, Common Stock or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Board).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P294_S1	Immediately upon the action of the Board authorizing redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the $0.0001 redemption price.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P295_S0	The Rights Agreement further provides that in the event the Company receives a Qualifying Offer (that has not been terminated prior thereto and which continues to be a Qualifying Offer), stockholders representing at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding may request that the Board call a special meeting of stockholders to vote to exempt the Qualifying Offer from the operation of the Rights Agreement not earlier than 90, nor later than 120, business days following the commencement of such offer.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P295_S1	The Board must then call and hold such a meeting to vote on exempting such offer from the terms of the Rights Agreement within the 90th business day following receipt of the stockholder demand for the meeting; provided that such period may be extended if, prior to the vote, the Company enters into an agreement (that is conditioned on the approval by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock) with respect to a merger, recapitalization, share exchange, or a similar transaction involving the Company or the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50% of the Company s consolidated total assets (a Definitive Acquisition Agreement ), until the time of the meeting at which the stockholders will be asked to vote on the Definitive Acquisition Agreement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P295_S2	If no Acquiring Person has emerged, the offer continues to be a Qualifying Offer and stockholders representing at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at the meeting at which a quorum is present vote in favor of redeeming the rights, then such Qualifying Offer shall be deemed exempt from the Rights Agreement on the date that the vote results are certified.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P295_S3	If no Acquiring Person has emerged and no special meeting is held by the date required, the Rights will be redeemed at the close of business on the tenth business day following that date.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P296_S0	A Qualifying Offer, in summary terms, is an offer determined by the Board to have each of the following characteristics which are generally intended to preclude offers that are coercive, abusive, or clearly illegitimate:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P297_S0	is accompanied by certifications of the offeror and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer (in their individual capacities) that all information that may be material to an investor s decision to accept the offer have been, and will continue to be promptly for the pendency of the offer, fully and accurately disclosed.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P298_S0	Any offers that have cash as all or partial consideration are subject to further conditions for qualification as qualifying offers, as set forth in the Rights Agreement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P298_S1	These conditions generally require assurance that the offer is fully financed and that the offeror has sufficient committed resources to consummate the offer.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P298_S2	Any offers that have acquiror common stock as all or partial consideration are subject to further conditions for qualification as qualifying offers, as set forth in the Rights Agreement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P298_S3	These conditions generally require certain safeguards regarding, and access to, information about the acquiror to allow an informed determination as to the value and risks of the stock, including safeguards against developments that adversely affect the value of the stock, that the acquiror s stock (which may not have subordinated voting rights nor may its ownership be heavily concentrated in one person or group) is listed on a national exchange, that the acquiror meets certain seasoned issuer standards under the Securities Act of 1933, and that no acquiror stockholder approval of the issuance of the consideration to the Company stockholders is necessary after commencement of the offer.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P299_S0	Pursuant to the sunset provision contained in the Rights Agreement, continuation of the Rights Agreement will be put to a vote of the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2014 annual meeting of stockholders.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P299_S1	If the majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are not voted in favor of continuation of the Rights Agreement, the Rights will automatically terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the $0.0001 redemption price.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P300_S0	Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P300_S1	While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for Common Stock (or other consideration) of the Company or for common stock of the acquiring company or in the event of the redemption of the Rights as set forth above.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P301_S0	Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board prior to the Distribution Date.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P301_S1	After the Distribution Date, the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board in order to cure any ambiguity, to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights, or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P301_S2	The foregoing notwithstanding, no amendment may be made at such time as the Rights are not redeemable.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P302_S0	A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to the Current Reports on Form 8-K on July 8, 2005, and July 10, 2008 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on June 14, 2011.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P302_S1	A copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P305_S1	The parties agree that the following specific terms and conditions shall apply:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P306_S0	For purposes of Section 8, the definition of C200 System shall include any C200 system, C200 Bay Upgrade Kit (defined below), and any system that incorporates the C200 engine as a component of a larger C200 engine based microturbine system, including but not limited to a C600 system, C800 system, or C1000 system.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P307_S0	Under the Development Agreement, Capstone royalty payments are based on a percentage of sales price.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P307_S1	The parties agree to replace this payment rate with a payment rate based on fixed fees, to be adjusted annually.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P307_S2	The applicable fixed fee rates are set forth below.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P307_S3	The rates below shall be adjusted annually, effective January 1 of each applicable year, based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
1009759_11_ITEM15_P308_S0	For each C200 Bay Upgrade Kit : US $ 12,000 A C200 Bay Upgrade Kit shall mean any C200 engine that is sold for the purposes of upgrading a C600 or C800 system into the next size system configuration.

1009759_11_ITEM15_P308_S2	For the avoidance of doubt: for purposes of this section, a larger microturbine system that is C200 engine based will include any changes in system output (i.e. it shall not be limited to C200 and will include the future C250).
1009759_11_ITEM15_P309_S0	Effective dates for new payment rates:

1009759_11_ITEM15_P399_S0	In connection with the annual report of Capstone Turbine Corporation (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), Darren R. Jamison, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Edward I. Reich, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each hereby certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_11_ITEM15_P400_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ("Capstone" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide "on-site power generation" (also called "distributed generation") such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on-site power with lower scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand-alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold primarily through our distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P2_S6	Service is provided directly by us through our Factory Protection Plan ("FPP") or by our distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial, and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ("kW") to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our 30 kW ("C30") microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	The 65 kW ("C65") microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100-room hotel while also providing about one-third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S5	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our microturbines combine patented air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S8	Because of our air-bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P4_S9	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our products produce exceptionally clean power.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our C65 was certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our C65 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified in January 2008 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Digester Gas systems were certified in November 2010 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS") and entered into a manufacturing sub-contract agreement and an original equipment manufacturer agreement with selected exclusive rights to package a combined microturbine and waste heat recovery generator product.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry and the 100 kW rating fits well between our C65 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The 125 kW waste heat recovery generator can be directly fired by the exhaust of six C65 or two C200 microturbines to provide a total of over 500 kW of clean and efficient green power in applications where the microturbine exhaust is not otherwise utilized, such as CHP or CCHP.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after-market parts and services.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users' sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post-commissioning service.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our distributors perform as value-added resellers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	OEMs integrate Capstone's products into their own product solutions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer ("FTI") training and certification program.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Capstone has a factory direct service offering for commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We offer a comprehensive FPP where Capstone charges a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled maintenance and other maintenance as needed.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Capstone then performs the required maintenance directly with its own personnel or contracts with one of its local distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers ("ASPs") and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ("C60"), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We began shipping the C60 Integrated CHP solution in 2003.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	During Fiscal 2012, we booked total orders of $122.5 million for 637 units, or 136.3 megawatts, compared to $86.5 million for 554 units, or 91.9 megawatts, during Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We shipped 627 units with an aggregate of 96.1 megawatts, generating revenue of $89.9 million compared to 611 units with an aggregate of 69.7 megawatts, generating revenue of $66.4 million during Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Total backlog as of March 31, 2012 increased $32.6 million, or 31%, to $139.0 million from $106.4 million at March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	As of March 31, 2012, we had 679 units, or 158.8 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 669 units, or 118.6 megawatts, for the same period last year.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the backlog was current and expected to be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue and shipment of our products from backlog.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ("BTU") gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features:
1009759_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	advanced combustion technology; patented air-bearing technology; digital power electronics; and remote monitoring capability.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design that is simple to manufacture.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum-based lubrication.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Air-bearings use a high-pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	For instance, our electronics control the microturbine's speed, temperature and fuel flow and communicate with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid-connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand-alone mode.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	All control functions are performed digitally.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; on a stand-alone basis as a voltage source; multipacked to support larger loads as a "virtual single" unit; and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We also offer C65 and C200 ICHP systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	These systems combine the standard C65 and C200 microturbine unit with a Heat Recovery Module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual-mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone's proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications; and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ("CRMS") allows end users to remotely operate and manage the microturbine.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require manual monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to remotely and efficiently monitor performance, power generation and time of operation using our CRMS interface software with standard personal computers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Capstone is currently developing an Internet based system to provide real-time continuous remote monitoring and diagnostics to customers who purchase the service.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	This new system is intended to replace the Capstone Service Network.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	We have expanded our microturbine's functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Capstone microturbine's multi-fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our C65 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its "Rule 21" grid interconnection standard.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site-by-site and utility-by-utility analysis.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre-cleared our microturbines for connection to New York's electric utility grid.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our C65 microturbine now meets the even more stringent CARB 2007 standard for natural gas.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand-alone operation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous-area oil and gas applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back-up generators as small as two kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	Within the distributed generation markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	In the markets we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our microturbines' emissions of commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants") such as nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide ("CO") and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") are lower than those from the on-site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	A study conducted for the US Department of Energy ("DOE") calculated the total potential energy efficiency CHP market in the United States to be over 35.5 gigawatts through 2020.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	In February 2010, we entered into an agreement with CPS to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generators in exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements through December 2015.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbine for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	In mid 2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	The market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is vast.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	The shale gas market is expected to grow substantially, especially since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Clean Air Act has strict requirements for emissions levels at natural gas sites.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology and information systems companies require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	Capstone's critical power supply offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source ("UPS") solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	We offer two microturbine-powered UPS solutions that support prime and dispatched power options.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	The Capstone UPSource microturbine-powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S4	Capstone's Hybrid UPS microturbine powered solution provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power solutions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S5	Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% reliability when the product has at least one independent backup.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S6	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S7	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S8	These systems offer high onsite energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P56_S9	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ("HEV") applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric vehicles such as transit buses, trucks and boats.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Many manufacturers are incorporating exhaust aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment due anywhere from in advance of shipment to 90 days from shipment, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 18 months from shipment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources and mobile products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P62_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P62_S4	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our market focus in Asia and Australia is energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the CHP, CCHP and the oil and gas market.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	South Korea and China are areas where renewable energy applications and CHP and CCHP solutions are expected to experience market growth.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Russia continues to be one of our fastest growing markets in CHP, CCHP, oil and gas, renewable energy and mobile products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Despite the increase in sales in Europe during Fiscal 2012, we have encountered some recent slowing of sales activity there and are discussing with certain of our European distributors the availability of financing for the purchase of our product.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	Continued financial instability there could have an adverse effect on our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in South America has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout South America.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our market focus in South America is energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Sales to Banking Production Centre ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 26%, 23% and 14% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	Sales to Pumps and Service Company ("Pumps and Service"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 19%, 18% and 4% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	Sales to Aquatec-Maxcon Pty Ltd. ("Aquatec"), our Australian distributor, accounted for 2%, 4% and 14% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	Additionally, BPC accounted for 44% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P69_S4	BPC and Verdesis S.A. ("Verdesis"), the Company's Belgian distributor, accounted for 26% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	As many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well-established companies, they derive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence and greater resources, which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	These technologies, which typically have a lower up-front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Dresser Waukesha, a business unit of Dresser, Inc., GE Energy Jenbacher gas engines, Tecogen, Inc. and Deutz Corporation, among others.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind power systems and fuel cells.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including FuelCell Energy Inc., UTC Power Corporation ("UTCP"), Bloom Energy Corporation, Plug Power Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	However, over the medium-to-long term, fuel cell technologies that compete more directly with our products may be introduced.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Overall, we compete with end users' other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine's ability to:
1009759_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; operate on multiple fuel types; reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases); simplify operation; and control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S6	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S7	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P84_S8	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	Capstone continues to engage with Federal and State policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone's low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	In 2011, U.S. Congresswoman Linda Sanchez introduced legislation to raise the investment tax credit for microturbine property.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	Other legislation is under consideration by Congress that could stimulate the market for Capstone products by providing incentives to encourage energy efficiency.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P86_S2	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however, or that it will benefit us if enacted.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	Several state programs were introduced in 2011 and 2012 that provide financial support to combined heat and power projects, and some of these programs have begun to benefit Capstone's customers.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	For example, in California, the Self Generation Incentive Program was modified to allow natural gas and energy efficiency CHP applications to receive rebates.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	Capstone's customers have utilized trade financing through the Export-Import Bank of the United States ("Ex-Im Bank") in the past, and Capstone has seen more customers use Ex-Im Bank financing for projects in 2011 and 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	While we continue to receive development funding, committed amounts remaining are relatively low.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume, low cost production objectives.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our strategy of outsourcing the manufacturing and assembly of our nonproprietary product components allows for more attractive pricing, quick ramp-up and the use of just-in-time inventory management techniques.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	We assemble and test units as well as manufacture air-bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P92_S2	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for other critical components.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P92_S3	We have evaluated our core competencies to identify additional outsourcing opportunities which we are now actively pursuing.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P92_S4	We monitor parts subject to a single or a limited source supply to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could impact our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	The cores are subject to a per-unit royalty fee.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P94_S3	As of March 31, 2012, cumulative royalties of $0.4 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	On April 28, 2011, we purchased from CPS for $2.3 million the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements through December 2015, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P96_S2	As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, R D expenses were $8.2 million, $7.0 million and $7.0 million and were 7%, 9% and 11% of total revenue, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants and the Development and License Agreement ("Development Agreement") with Carrier Corporation ("Carrier"), successor in interest to UTC Power Corporation ("UTCP").
1009759_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	Benefits from cost-sharing programs were $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.7 million for Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our more recent significant R D activity has been in connection with development of the C200 microturbine, a 200 kW, higher electrical efficiency product.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	Capstone worked with the DOE on its "Advanced MicroTurbine System" program and received funding for some of the early C200 development efforts.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	C200 beta testing demonstrated performance to design objectives making the C200 the highest electrical efficiency microturbine producing less than 4.5 megawatts.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	The C200 includes the same low emissions, certification options, and flexible configuration features incorporated on our existing C30 and C60 Series products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	Capstone signed an agreement with UTCP to provide cash and in-kind services to complete development and commercially launch the C200 product in September 2007.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	Our C200 beta testing was successfully implemented during Fiscal 2005 and the first commercial shipment was on August 28, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine product line.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	This product family can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO container.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P101_S2	Benefits of the C1000 Series product include low greenhouse-gas emissions, patented air-bearing microturbine technology, ease of installation and commissioning with a single fuel and electrical connection, minimal scheduled maintenance and downtime, low noise and vibration and one of the industry's smallest modular footprints.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P101_S3	Additional features include Capstone's remote monitoring and diagnostic capabilities and integrated utility synchronization and protection.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P101_S4	Our C1000 Series product beta testing was successfully implemented during Fiscal 2009 and the first commercial shipment was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	Engineering resources are being applied to cost reduction activities to improve the direct material costs of our microturbine products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	Current cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base through identification of value added suppliers, working with existing suppliers to identify process and tooling improvements, entering into long term agreements and transitioning parts to low cost manufacturing regions.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P102_S2	Cross functional teams, including internal engineering resources and supplier resources, are used to drive changes with a focus on mutually beneficial long-term relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	In September 2011, we received CARB certification to the 2007 Fossil Fuel Standards for our C200 ICHP microturbine power systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P103_S1	This standard represents the most stringent emissions standard worldwide set to the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for large central power plants.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P103_S2	To put these emissions levels in perspective, it is challenging to measure the extremely low levels required with today's best emissions measurement equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	through scaling and optimization of Capstone existing lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	Test emissions from both the C30 and C65 natural gas fueled microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	The emissions levels are set so low that the California Air Resources Board has not defined any further limit reductions in the foreseeable future.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	We continue to release variants of the C200 product to provide the same features that we offer customers with our C30 and C65 microturbine products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	A liquid fuel version of the C200 product has been developed with Capstone's lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	This technology allows operation on various fuels by changing the injector to achieve the necessary fuel to air ratio mixture, fuel atomization, stability, and exhaust emission levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P107_S2	The control system is modified to incorporate required algorithm modifications for start/stop sequencing and load state operation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone's microturbine products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	The C200 product is offered for sale configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P109_S2	The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P109_S3	Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	Capstone offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	Capstone released for sale the C65 stand-alone digester product for sale in the renewable energy market segment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P111_S1	This product is targeted at remote villages in third world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 Digester Gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	Capstone recently received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum (CIF) for its C65 Hybrid Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Microturbine at Syracuse University's data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	The product utilizes Capstone's inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to the customer critical load.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S2	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S3	Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S4	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone's multipack feature.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S5	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P113_S6	Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, the low emissions of the Capstone Hybrid UPS product allow for continuous operation year round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	We are continuing to work on product improvements to our C30 and C65 microturbine products targeted at the hybrid electric bus and truck market.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	Because of Capstone's single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	During the 2011 Hybrid Truck User's Forum in Baltimore Maryland, it was announced that both Kenworth Truck Company and Peterbilt Motors Company are working with Capstone to demonstrate Class 7 and Class 8 microturbine range extended series hybrid trucks.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	Both vehicles are concept trucks intended to quantify the performance, efficiency, and economic benefits of a microturbine-based series hybrid solution.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P116_S3	In the meantime, Capstone has other hybrid vehicle customers that will benefit from continued development of this technology.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	The C65 Liquid Fuel microturbine demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines (HDDE).
1009759_12_ITEM1_P117_S1	These requirements are met using test procedures which evaluate emissions performance through start/stop and load transient cycles.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P117_S2	Capstone is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust after treatment.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require exhaust after treatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	The C30 Liquid Fuel microturbine met these requirements in March 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P118_S2	In August 2011, we announced configurations of the C30 and C65 compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled microturbines that meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On-Road Heavy Duty Diesel Engines for Urban Bus.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P118_S3	Test emissions from both the C30 and C65 Natural Gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	We believe that future products will require the implementation of On Board Diagnostic (OBD) controls to gain Model Year certification through the CARB.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P120_S0	Capstone is working with the Department of Energy (DOE) on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including the Flexible Fuel Turbine System (FFTS) and High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P120_S1	The FFTS program is aimed at developing a microturbine system for operation on a range of higher BTU gaseous fuels, including synthetic gas (SynGas) produced by a biomass gasifier and hydrogen.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P121_S0	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P121_S1	We are currently focusing efforts on the development of the High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery system.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P121_S2	The first phase of the development program is expected to improve our existing C200 engine to increase power output and electrical efficiency, resulting in a system with a targeted power output of 250 kW and projected electrical efficiency of 35%.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P121_S3	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits users through lower operating costs.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P122_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P122_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 109 U.S. and 36 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_12_ITEM1_P122_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2014 and 2027.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P122_S3	These numbers include 24 U.S. patents and 3 international patents that were acquired from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P123_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is an important component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long-term competitive advantage.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P123_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P124_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P125_S0	As of March 31, 2012, we had 215 employees.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P125_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_12_ITEM1_P126_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.

1009759_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements, or the Agreements, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ("Wells Fargo"), that provide us with a credit facility up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	At March 31, 2012, we had $10.4 million outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, we have pledged our accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral under the Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the Agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we had not obtained the default waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Impairment charges on our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset with its carrying value.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	costs associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines; maintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines; the future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines; economic downturns and reduction in capital spending; consumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality; the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products; and decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S9	We also outsource certain of our components internationally and expect to increase international outsourcing of components.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P28_S10	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Current economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Current economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the continued recession in economic activity.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	For example, we have encountered some recent slowing of sales activity in Europe and are discussing with certain of our European distributors the availability of financing for the purchase of our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Continued financial instability there could have an adverse effect on our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S5	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we have and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis- -vis our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors; product quality and performance; operating efficiency; product price; availability, price and compatibility of fuel; development of new products and features; and emissions levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and global economic or political instability.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Two of our top distributors are located in Russia and Belgium, and therefore we are particularly susceptible to risks associated with doing business in these two countries.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or the impact thereof on our operations or the market price of our common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective or that future material changes to our internal controls will be effective.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock or warrants.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenues from these relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S4	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Activities necessary to integrate the acquisition of the microturbine business of CPS and any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $18.6 million and $19.3 million as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of Fiscal 2012 was 56 days, compared with 78 days at the end of Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We recorded bad debt expense of $2.3 million and $0.2 million during Fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	BPC and Pumps and Service accounted for approximately 26% and 19%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As of March 31, 2012, BPC and Pumps and Service represented 44% and 6% of net accounts receivable, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Loss of BPC, Pumps and Service or any other significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P65_S8	Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P68_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P82_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Potential labor, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We may face litigation relating to labor matters or other matters.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We are a party to a stockholder lawsuit alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our November 2000 secondary offering, as described under "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P84_S2	An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S2	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S5	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P87_S6	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P89_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	At March 31, 2012, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $572.5 million and $236.2 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P93_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P99_S2	On August 23, 2010, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P99_S3	We subsequently regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P99_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P100_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P102_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	future equity financings; the failure to produce our products on a timely basis in accordance with customer expectations; the inability to obtain necessary components on time and at a reasonable cost; litigation or disputes with customers or business partners; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales or purchases of our common stock; the trading volume of our common stock; developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and decreases in oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P104_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	We are currently subject to litigation relating to a common stock offering as described under "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P105_S2	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right has been issued for each share of our common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Until the occurrence of certain prescribed events, the rights are not exercisable and are transferable along with, and only with, each share of our common stock and are evidenced by the common stock certificates.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P109_S2	One preferred stock purchase right will also be issued with each share of our common stock we issue in the future until the rights plan expires or is terminated or we redeem or exchange the rights for other property in accordance with the terms of the rights plan or at such time, if any, as the rights separate from each share of our common stock and become exercisable.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, dividends payable in cash in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends or other distributions, including non-cash dividends (payable in kind), declared on our common stock other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The rights plan prohibits the issuance of additional rights after the rights separate from our common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P111_S1	The rights plan is intended to protect our stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us.
1009759_12_ITEM1A_P111_S2	However, the existence of the rights plan may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of us that is not supported by our board of directors.
1009759_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our lease for those premises expires in July 2014, and we have two five-year options to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2012, and we have one five-year option to extend this lease.
1009759_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In December 2001, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company, two of its then officers, and the underwriters of our initial public offering.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The suit purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from June 28, 2000 to December 6, 2000.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	An amended complaint was filed on April 19, 2002.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	The plaintiffs allege that the prospectuses for our June 28, 2000 initial public offering and November 16, 2000 secondary offering were false and misleading in violation of the applicable securities laws because the prospectuses failed to disclose the underwriter defendants' alleged agreement to allocate stock in these offerings to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	Similar complaints have been filed against hundreds of other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998; the complaints have been consolidated into an action captioned In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 9, 2002, the plaintiffs dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against the named officers and directors in the action against the Company, pursuant to the terms of Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements entered into with the plaintiffs (the "Tolling Agreements").
1009759_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	Subsequent addenda to the Tolling Agreements extended the tolling period through August 27, 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of "focus cases" and on October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Our case is not one of these focus cases.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	The underwriter defendants appealed that ruling, and on December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's class certification decision.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended complaints against the six focus cases and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P2_S4	On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus cases moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	The motion for class certification was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	On April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement between the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	The settlement "fairness" hearing was held on September 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	On October 6, 2009, the District Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the District Court close these actions.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	On August 26, 2010, based on the expiration of the tolling period stated in the Tolling Agreements, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Termination of Tolling Agreement and Recommencement of Litigation against the named officers and directors.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	The plaintiffs stated to the District Court that they do not intend to take any further action against the named officers and directors at this time.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	Appeals of the opinion granting final approval were filed, all of which have been dismissed or settled.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	On October 9, 2007, Vanessa Simmonds, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington(the "Washington District Court") against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Merrill Lynch Co., Inc., and Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriters of our initial public offering in June 1999, and our secondary offering of common stock in November 2000, alleging violations of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
1009759_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	The complaint sought to recover from the lead underwriters any "short swing profits" obtained by them in violation of Section 16(b).
1009759_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	The suit names the Company as a nominal defendant, contained no claims against the Company, and sought no relief from the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P8_S0	Simmonds filed an Amended Complaint on February 27, 2008 (the "Amended Complaint"), naming as defendants Goldman Sachs Co. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner Smith Inc. and again naming Morgan Stanley.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Co., Inc. were no longer named as defendants.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P9_S0	The Amended Complaint asserted substantially similar claims as those set forth in the initial complaint.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P10_S0	On July 25, 2008, the Company joined with 29 other issuers to file the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P10_S1	On March 12, 2009, the Washington District Court granted the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that Simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on the Company prior to filing her complaint.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P10_S2	In its order, the Washington District Court stated that it would not permit Simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P10_S3	Because the Washington District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, it did not specifically reach the issue of whether Simmonds' claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P10_S4	However, the Washington District Court also granted the Underwriters' Joint Motion to Dismiss with respect to cases involving non-moving issuers, holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers' stockholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P11_S0	Simmonds filed a Notice of Appeal on April 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P11_S1	The underwriters subsequently filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, arguing that the dismissal of the claims involving the moving issuers should have been with prejudice because the claims were untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P11_S2	On December 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit") affirmed the Washington District Court's decision to dismiss the moving issuers' cases (including the Company's) on the grounds that plaintiff's demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P11_S3	The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed and remanded the Washington District Court's decision on the underwriters' motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the non-moving issuers' initial public offerings, finding plaintiff's claims were not time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P11_S4	In remanding, the Ninth Circuit advised the non-moving issuers and underwriters to file in the Washington District Court the same challenges to plaintiff's demand letters that moving issuers had filed.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P12_S0	On December 16, 2010, the underwriters filed a petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P12_S1	Appellant Vanessa Simmonds also filed a petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P13_S0	denied the petition for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P13_S1	It further ordered that no further petitions for rehearing may be filed.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P13_S2	On January 26, 2011, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the mandate in all cases (including the Company's and other moving issuers) was stayed for ninety days pending Simmonds' filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P14_S0	On April 5, 2011, Simmonds filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the adequacy of the pre-suit demand.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P14_S1	On April 15, 2011, underwriter defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the statute of limitations issue.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P14_S2	On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court denied Simmonds' petition regarding the demand issue and granted the underwriters' petition relating to the statute of limitations issue.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P14_S3	Oral arguments on underwriters' petition were heard on November 29, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P14_S4	On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's holding that petitioner's claims were not time-barred and remanded the cases to the District Court for proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P15_S0	Management believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on the Company's business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P16_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to additional legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1009759_12_ITEM3_P16_S1	Other than the matters discussed above, we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that would have a material effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "CPST".
1009759_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the low and high sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 7, 2012, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $0.98 per share.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 7, 2012 there were 815 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant, including approval from Wells Fargo.
1009759_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data shown below have been derived from the audited financial statements of Capstone.

1009759_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is, and has been, the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We were able to significantly increase revenues again this year despite the challenging economic conditions worldwide.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Management believes that our efforts on the continued growth and broadening of our distribution network and the stronger than anticipated market acceptance of our new C1000 Series products were the primary reasons for our revenue growth.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Capstone continues to gain market share in all five of its major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products).
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the energy efficiency market we continue to expand our market share in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	The renewable energy market continues to be a significant portion of our business as we shipped products around the globe for applications fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, biogas such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our C1000 Series microturbine continues to drive our near term business success in the oil and gas and other natural resource markets as we gain product acceptance in U.S. shale plays and Russian oil fields.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our critical power supply data center product is performing well, and we continue to focus efforts on gaining market share with this new product.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	Capstone's mobile products market utilizing microturbines for electric vehicles is gaining interest for use of our products as range extenders in electric buses, trucks, and the marine industry.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near-term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, management closely manages operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	The key drivers to Capstone's success are continuing to increase C200 microturbine engine production rates, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	On February 1, 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with CPS ("APA").
1009759_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company acquired, subject to an existing license retained by CPS, all of the rights and assets related to the manufacture and sale of the TA100 microturbine generator, including intellectual property, design, tooling, drawings, patents, know-how, distribution agreements and supply agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Pursuant to the APA, the Company issued to CPS 1,550,387 shares of common stock at the closing date on February 1, 2010 and agreed to pay additional consideration of $3.1 million on July 30, 2010 (the "Second Funding Date").
1009759_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	The additional consideration was to be paid, at the Company's discretion, in shares of the Company's common stock or cash.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	The Company elected to satisfy the amount due on the Second Funding Date with common stock and issued 3,131,313 shares to CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	On April 28, 2011, we purchased from CPS for $2.3 million the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the TA100 manufacturing equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	To support our opportunities to grow in our targeted markets, we continue to enhance the reliability and performance of our products by regularly developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	1) Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	During Fiscal 2012, we booked orders for 136.3 megawatts and shipped 96.1 megawatts of products, which combined with our backlog at March 31, 2011, resulted in 158.8 megawatts in backlog at the end of the fiscal year.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our product shipments in Fiscal 2012 were: 58% for use in natural resources applications, 25% for use in energy efficiency applications, 16% for use in renewable energy applications and 1% for use in other applications (including critical power supply and mobile products).
1009759_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste (green waste) and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Capstone's product can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding area.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Typically oil and gas or mining operations are in remote locations where the electric utility grid is not available.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Therefore, these operations rely on the microturbines' ability to provide reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users, such as high technology and information systems companies, require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric mobile applications, such as transit buses, trucks and boats.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	2) Sales and Distribution Channel We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	In North America, we currently have 35 distributors and OEMs, which include six distributors added as a result of the CPS transaction.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Internationally, outside of North America, we currently have 58 distributors and OEMs, which include 11 distributors added as a result of the CPS transaction.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	We continue to refine the distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	3) Service We serve our customers directly and through qualified distributors, who will perform their service work using technicians specifically trained by Capstone.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	We offer a comprehensive FPP where Capstone charges a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled maintenance, as well as other maintenance as needed.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	Capstone then performs the required maintenance directly with its own personnel, or contracts with one of its local distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P16_S7	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Capstone provides factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2012 was $33.7 million which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2027.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Service revenue in Fiscal 2012 was approximately 8% of total revenue.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	4) Product Robustness and Life Cycle Maintenance Costs To provide us with the ability to evaluate microturbine performance in the field we are developing an updated "real-time" Internet based remote monitoring and diagnostic feature, to replace our previous CSN system and take advantage of newer generation technology.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	This feature will allow us to monitor installed units and rapidly collect operating data on a continual basis, even in areas with limited or no landline internet connection.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	We will use this information to anticipate and more quickly respond to field performance issues, evaluate component robustness and identify areas for continuous improvement.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S8	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, TA100, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P17_S9	Our product development efforts are centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We are currently focusing efforts on developing a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power ("CHP") system.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The first phase of the development program is expected to improve our existing C200 engine to increase power output and electrical efficiency, resulting in a system with a targeted power output of 250 kW and projected electrical efficiency of 35%.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	In addition, we are developing and testing a fuel flexible microturbine system capable of operating on synthetic gas fuel mixtures containing varying amounts of hydrogen.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The DOE awarded us a grant of $2.5 million in support of this development program.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	6) Cost and Core Competencies We are continuing to make progress towards achieving cost improvement goals through design and manufacturability changes, robotics, parts commonality, tier one suppliers and lower cost offshore suppliers.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	We have made progress and plan to continue diversifying our suppliers internationally and within the United States.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	Management also expects to be able to continue leveraging our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone's promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we ship approximately 200 units in a quarter, depending on an assumed product mix.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1009759_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The estimated fair value of the assets are determined using the best information available, which generally is an estimate of the future discounted cash flow associated with the assets using a discount rate that approximates the weighted-average cost of capital for the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	A significant assumption in our forecasts is our ability to reduce our direct material costs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Based on our current forecasts, if we were not able to achieve additional significant cost reductions, our estimated undiscounted cash flows may not exceed the carrying value of our long-lived assets, which could result in a future impairment of our long-lived assets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2012 and determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying value of the assets and no write-down was necessary.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ("FIFO") basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write-downs of inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long-term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed-upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	For multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, the Company's estimated selling price of each element is known and customer acceptance, if required, has occurred.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	We allocate the total contract value among each element based on its relative selling price.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days or past payment terms.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is "more likely than not" that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily state taxes.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred income tax asset at that time.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	We record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Any unfavorable outcome of litigation or other contingencies could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The use of Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The term "forfeitures" is distinct from "cancellations" or "expirations" and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	We re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	Ultimately, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	As discussed in Note 9 Fair Value Measurements in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements", ASC 815 requires that our warrants be accounted for as derivative instruments and that we mark the value of our warrant liability to market and recognize the change in valuation in our statement of operations each reporting period.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Determining the warrant liability to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of the warrants.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	We calculate the fair values using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the contractual life of the warrants, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the warrant contractual life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2012 increased $27.5 million, or 34%, to $109.4 million from $81.9 million for Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2012 compared to Fiscal 2011 included increases in revenue of $17.9 million from the North American market, $11.1 million from the European market, $0.8 million from the South American market and $0.8 million from the African market.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The increase in the South American and African markets was primarily because of our continued efforts to improve distribution channels.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $2.1 million from the Asian market and $1.0 million from the Australia market as a result of non-recurring microturbine product sales for specific projects that had occurred in the same period last year.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	For Fiscal 2012, revenue from microturbine products increased $23.6 million, or 36%, to $89.9 million from $66.3 million for Fiscal 2011.

1009759_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Megawatts shipped and revenue per unit during Fiscal 2012 increased as a result of higher sales volume for our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, offset by lower sales volume for our TA100 microturbine as a result of the integration of the TA100 microturbine manufacturing process into Capstone's facility in Van Nuys.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	For Fiscal 2012, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $3.9 million, or 25%, to $19.5 million from $15.6 million for Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales of microturbine parts, FPP contract enrollments and microturbine service work.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue and shipment of our products from backlog.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.

1009759_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	All microturbine products had better margins than Fiscal 2011 as a result of higher average selling prices and overall lower direct material costs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The $13.0 million improvement was offset by an increase in production and service center labor and overhead expenses of $3.3 million, warranty expense of $2.1 million, royalty expense of $1.3 million and inventory charges of $0.4 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Management has taken initiatives to further reduce direct material costs and other manufacturing and warranty costs as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense increased $3.3 million during Fiscal 2012 compared to Fiscal 2011 as the result of increased salaries, freight and supplies expense and further development of our service centers to meet obligations under FPP contracts.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Reliability repair programs are estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increase in warranty expense of $2.1 million reflects an increase in the standard warranty provision as a result of an increase in warranty claims related primarily to C200 and C1000 Series systems and higher volume of units under warranty during Fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Royalty expense increased $1.3 million during Fiscal 2012 compared to Fiscal 2011 as a result of higher sales of our C200 and C1000 Series systems.

1009759_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	The overall increase in R D expenses of $1.2 million resulted from increased salaries of $1.5 million, supplies of $0.2 million and reduced cost-sharing benefits of $0.1 million, offset by a decrease in consulting related expense of $0.6 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P67_S4	There were approximately $0.8 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2012 and $0.9 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phases of the programs.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2013 to be higher than in Fiscal 2012 as we continue to implement our new product development and direct material cost reduction initiatives.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	A expenses for Fiscal 2012 increased $2.7 million, or 10%, to $28.9 million from $26.2 million for Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	The net increase in SG A expenses was comprised of an increase of $2.0 million in bad debt expense, $0.6 million in professional services expense, which includes accounting and legal expenses, $0.8 million in marketing expense and $0.4 million in consulting expense, offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in salary expense and $0.5 million in travel expense.

1009759_12_ITEM7_P105_S6	An increase in deferred revenue of $1.8 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to an increase in deferred revenue of $0.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P105_S7	The change in deferred revenue of $1.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to the year ended March 31, 2011 resulted from an increase in FPP contract enrollment compared to the same period last year.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $0.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 relates primarily to $1.5 million used for the acquisition of fixed assets during the year ended March 31, 2012 offset by a benefit from the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash from Wells Fargo, which was previously restricted as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	Cash used in investing activities of $2.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2011 relates primarily to the release of $1.3 million of restricted cash from Wells Fargo and $1.0 million for the acquisition of fixed assets during the year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Financing Activities During the year ended March 31, 2012, we generated $38.1 million in cash from financing activities compared to cash generated during the year ended March 31, 2011 of $10.4 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2012 were primarily from proceeds related to our registered direct placement of securities described below, the exercise of common stock warrants and additional borrowings under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	Net borrowings under the Credit Facility was $3.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to net repayment of $0.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Effective March 5, 2012, we completed a registered direct placement in which we sold 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, and warrants to purchase 22.6 million shares of common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.55 per share, at a price of $1.11 per unit.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	The warrants expire on October 31, 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	In addition, the Company obtained the right to require the investors to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of 19.0 million additional shares of common stock from the Company (the "Put Option") during two option exercise periods, the first such option exercise period beginning September 10, 2012 and the second such option exercise period beginning March 4, 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	of shares that can be sold or eliminate the Put Option.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	These conditions include a minimum volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and a minimum average trading volume of the Company's common shares during the 30 trading days prior to the exercise of the Put Option.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	The March 2012 sale resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $25.0 million and proceeds net of direct incremental costs, of the offering of approximately $23.1 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	Effective January 9, 2012, we entered into warrant exercise agreements with two holders (the "Holders") of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share, that were issued by the Company on January 24, 2007 (the "2007 Warrants").
1009759_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for fees in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.3 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P110_S2	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of the 2007 Warrants were approximately $1.6 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Effective November 21, 2011, we entered into warrant exercise agreements with (i) two holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 17, 2009 (the "2009 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 5.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, (ii) four holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 23, 2008 (the "2008 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million shares and (iii) six holders of warrants issued by the Company on January 24, 2007 (the "2007 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of Common Stock.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	Pursuant to the Warrant Exercise Agreements, the 2009 holders agreed to exercise the September 2009 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.34 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $5.4 million, the 2008 holders agreed to exercise certain 2008 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.60 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.2 million and the 2007 holders agreed to exercise certain 2007 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $1.8 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of the 2009 Warrants, the 2008 Warrants and the 2007 Warrants were approximately $8.4 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P111_S3	An additional $0.5 million of 2008 Warrants were subsequently exercised on November 22, 2011 at the existing exercise price of $1.60 in exchange for a fee of approximately $0.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $0.4 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The holders of certain 2007 Warrants, exercised such warrants to purchase 0.1 million shares on July 20, 2011, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $0.1 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	The holders of certain 2008 Warrants, exercised such warrants to purchase 0.6 million shares on April 5, 2011, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $0.9 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	The funds generated from financing activities during Fiscal 2011 were primarily the result of the March 2011 warrant exercise transaction.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of such warrants, after deducting expense of approximately $0.4 million, were approximately $11.2 million.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Employee stock purchases, net of repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units, resulted in approximately $0.7 million of net cash generated during Fiscal 2012, compared with $40,000 of net cash generated during Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo, which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	The amount actually available to us may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, we granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of our assets.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014 unless terminated sooner.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, $10.4 million and $7.1 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, our capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (f) change our accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (a) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (b) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon the Company's financial performance, and (c) limitations on our annual capital expenditures.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we were in noncompliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	As a result of our non-compliance with the financial covenant in the Agreements regarding our net income as of March 31, 2010, Wells Fargo imposed default pricing of an additional 3.0% effective March 1, 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	In addition, as a condition of the further amendment of the Agreements, Wells Fargo restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 11, 2010 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	On November 9, 2010, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to provide for the release by Wells Fargo of the $5.0 million in cash restricted since June 2010 upon the Company's satisfaction of certain conditions.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	During Fiscal 2011, Wells Fargo released $3.7 million of the restricted cash.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	On March 25, 2011 we entered into an amendment to the Agreements that allows the Company to form one wholly-owned subsidiary in each of Singapore and the United Kingdom provided that the amount of cash and cash equivalents that may be held by, or invested in each such subsidiary is within certain agreed upon limits.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	This amendment also provides that, if requested by Wells Fargo, the Company will grant Wells Fargo a security interest in 65% of the equity interests of each subsidiary to secure indebtedness under the Agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we determined that we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding our net income.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	On June 9, 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of our noncompliance with the financial covenant as of March 31, 2011, and removed the net worth financial covenant for future periods.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	Additionally, this amendment also set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2012 and authorized the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	On September 27, 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to increase the borrowing capacity available under the Company's revolving line of credit to an aggregate of $15.0 million and extend the maturity date of the line of credit through September 30, 2014.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Additionally, this amendment made certain changes to the calculation and payment of interest under the Agreements and the financial covenant requiring a specified ratio of minimum cash balances to unreimbursed line of credit advances.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we determined that we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding our net income.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P124_S3	On February 8, 2012, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of our noncompliance with the financial covenant as of December 31, 2011 and set the financial covenants for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	On June12, 2012, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P126_S3	Based on our current forecasts, management believes we will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P126_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, management would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Although we have made progress on direct material cost reduction efforts, we were behind schedule in reducing costs at the end of Fiscal 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	In addition, our working capital requirements were higher than planned primarily as a result of increased inventories and warranty reserves.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months; however, if our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S3	The Company could seek to raise such funds by exercising the Put Option, by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S4	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S5	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P127_S6	In addition, the equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Should the Company be unable to execute its plans or obtain additional financing that might be needed, the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the current backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	the market acceptance of our products and services; our business, product and capital expenditure plans; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; our competitors' response to our products and services; our relationships with customers, distributors, dealers and project resellers; and our customers' ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	Additionally, the continued credit difficulties in the markets could prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $18.5 million and $19.3 million as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P131_S2	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of Fiscal 2012 was 56 days, compared with 78 days at the end of Fiscal 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P131_S3	We recorded bad debt expense of $2.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	expense during Fiscal 2012 was primarily related to one customer's financial difficulty.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P132_S3	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P132_S4	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas may have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	At March 31, 2012, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:
1009759_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	As of March 31, 2012, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $27.7 million through Fiscal 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	As part of the CPS acquisition, we agreed to purchase for cash any remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and was not considered excess or obsolete and to acquire certain TA100 manufacturing equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	On April 28, 2011, we purchased $2.3 million of the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P136_S2	As of March 31, 2012, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable under the Credit Facility is $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014 unless terminated sooner.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements of $18.7 million through December 2015, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P138_S2	As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P140_S2	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	In June 2011, the Financial Account Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income" ("ASU 2011-05"), which improves the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income ("OCI") by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	The amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P141_S2	We adopted this updated guidance with no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS" ("ASU 2011-04"), which amends current guidance to result in common fair value measurement and disclosures between accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	The amendments explain how to measure fair value.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S2	They do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuations standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S3	The amendments change the wording used to describe fair value measurement requirements and disclosures, but often do not result in a change in the application of current guidance.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S4	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM7_P142_S5	We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we may enter into transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to changes in the interest rates results primarily from our Credit Facility borrowings.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2012, we had $10.4 million of outstanding indebtedness subject to interest rate fluctuations.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Based on these borrowings as of March 31, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the then current LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $1.4 million on an annual basis.
1009759_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from period to period and therefore could result in additional interest.
1009759_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Annual Report beginning at page F-1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2012, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2012 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Additionally, such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The report of Deloitte Touch LLP follows.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended March 31, 2012 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_12_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated June 14, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation (the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	In addition, the Company's microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company was organized in 1988 and has been commercially producing its microturbine generators since 1998.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Management anticipates incurring additional losses until the Company can produce sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	To date, the Company has funded its activities primarily through private and public equity offerings.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $139.0 million, or 679 units, in backlog, all of which are expected to be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	However, the timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer payments and customer delivery schedules), some of which are beyond the Company's control and can affect the Company's quarterly revenue and backlog.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	Although the Company has made progress on direct material cost reduction efforts, the Company was behind schedule in reducing costs at the end of Fiscal 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S4	In addition, the Company's working capital requirements were higher than planned primarily as a result of increased inventories and warranty reserves.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S5	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months; however, if our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S6	In addition, the Company obtained the right, subject to certain conditions, to require the investors in the Company's March 2012 registered direct placement to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of 19.0 million additional shares of common stock from the Company (the "Put Option") during two option exercise periods.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S7	The Company could seek to raise such funds by exercising the Put Option, by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P28_S8	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revolving credit facility and notes payable approximate fair market value based on their short-term nature.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	See Note 9 Fair Value Measurements, for disclosure regarding the fair value of financial instruments.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Accounts Receivable The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The composition of inventory is routinely evaluated to identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	Included in the assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in the Company's products.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	All inventories expected to be used in more than one year are classified as long-term.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from two to ten years.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method with the exception of the backlog of 100 kW microturbines ("TA100") acquired from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS").
1009759_12_ITEM15_P38_S3	Purchased backlog is amortized based on unit sales.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	If the expected future cash flows from the use of such assets (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, the Company may be required to record a write-down, which is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2012 and determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying value of the assets and no write-down was necessary.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, trade name, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast the carrying value of our asset groups may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Revenue is generally recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Service performed by the Company has consisted primarily of commissioning and time and materials based contracts.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	The time and materials contracts are usually related to out-of-warranty units.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company also provides maintenance service contracts to customers of its existing installed base.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	The maintenance service contracts are agreements to perform certain services to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	Service revenue derived from maintenance service contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company occasionally enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as sale of equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, the Company's estimated selling price of each element is known and customer acceptance provisions, if any, have occurred.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Company allocates the total contract value among each element based on their relative selling prices.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Warranty The Company provides for the estimated costs of warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold, geography of sale and the length of extended warranties sold.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company's product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to eighteen months.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	Factors that affect the Company's warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S4	These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P49_S5	Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company's judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Total offsets to R D expenses amounted to $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Contingencies The Company records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Risk Concentrations Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	At March 31, 2012, the majority of our cash balances were held at financial institutions located in California, in accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Uninsured balances aggregate to approximately $49.8 million as of March 31, 2012.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	finite lives, product warranties, income taxes and other contingencies.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	Diluted loss per share is also computed without consideration to potentially dilutive instruments because the Company incurred losses which would make such instruments antidilutive.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Outstanding stock options at March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 10.0 million, 10.1 million and 9.2 million, respectively.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income", which improves the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income ("OCI") by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	The amendments included in this standard require that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Company adopted this updated guidance with no impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS" ("ASU 2011-04"), which amends current guidance to require common fair value measurement and disclosures between accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The amendments explain how to measure fair value.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	They do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	The amendments change the wording used to describe fair value measurement requirements and disclosures, but often do not result in a change in the application of current guidance.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S4	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P72_S5	The company does not believe that the adoption of the provisions of ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method) or market and consisted of the following as of March 31, 2012 and 2011:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	The non-current portion of inventories represents that portion of the inventories in excess of amounts expected to be used in the next twelve months.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The non-current inventories are primarily comprised of repair parts for older generation products that are still in operation, but are not technologically compatible with current configurations.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	During the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company determined the depreciation of its leasehold improvements had changed from an original estimate of eight years to a revised estimate of 9.1 years because of the extension of lease terms for both manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	This change in the estimated depreciation of the leasehold improvements resulted in a decrease in the annual depreciation from $1.3 million per year to $0.9 million per year in Fiscal 2010, a decrease from $0.8 million per year to $0.5 million per year in Fiscal 2011, an increase from $0.2 million per year to $0.5 million per year in Fiscal 2012, an increase from $23,000 per year to $0.4 million per year in Fiscal 2013, and an increase from $22,000 per year to $0.1 million per year in Fiscal 2014.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	See Note 14 Acquisition, for discussion of the MPL acquired from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	The acquired intangible assets include technology, parts and service customer relationships, the MPL customer relationships, backlog and trade name.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	These intangible assets have estimated useful lives between one and ten years.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired has been determined primarily by using the income approach.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Purchased identifiable intangible assets, except for backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives and classified as a component of cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses based on the function of the underlying asset.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Backlog is amortized on a per unit basis as the backlog units are sold and presented as a component of cost of goods sold.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The manufacturing license provides the Company with the ability to manufacture recuperator cores previously purchased from Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar").
1009759_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company is required to pay a per-unit royalty fee over a seventeen-year period for cores manufactured and sold by the Company using the technology.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	Royalties of approximately $72,800, $62,800, and $56,000 were earned by Solar for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	Earned royalties of approximately $17,500 and $17,700 were unpaid as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Changes in the accrued warranty reserve are as follows as of March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	ASC 740, Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Based on management's evaluation, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to research and development credits as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	There were no interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2012 or March 31, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P88_S2	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 was $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P88_S3	However, this impact would be offset by an equal increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance as the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets because of uncertainty as to future realization.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P88_S4	The fully reserved recognized federal and state deferred tax assets related to research and development credits balance as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $9.1 million and $9.0 million, and $7.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.75 shares of common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	The seven-year May 2009 Warrants were immediately exercisable and included certain weighted average anti-dilution provisions, subject to certain limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P130_S3	The sale resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $12.5 million and proceeds, net of direct transaction costs, of approximately $11.2 million.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P131_S2	During Fiscal 2011, the May 2009 Warrants were classified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" in the accompanying balance sheets and recorded at estimated fair value with the corresponding charge under the caption "Change in fair value of warrant liability" in the accompanying statements of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P131_S3	See Note 9 Fair Value Measurements for disclosure regarding the fair value of financial instrument.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Effective September 23, 2008, the Company completed a registered direct placement in which it sold 21.5 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, and warrants to purchase 6.4 million shares of common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.92 per share, at a price of $14.90 per unit.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	Each unit consisted of ten shares of common stock and warrants to purchase three shares of common stock.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P132_S2	The five-year warrants were immediately exercisable and included certain weighted average anti-dilution provisions, subject to certain limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P132_S3	Additionally, the Company has the right, at its option, to accelerate the expiration of the exercise period of the outstanding warrants issued in the offering, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time after the second anniversary of the original issue date of the warrants, subject to certain limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P132_S4	The sale resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $32.0 million and proceeds, net of direct incremental costs, of the offering of approximately $29.5 million.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	As discussed above, on March 9, 2011, warrants to purchase 0.4 million shares were exercised resulting in proceeds of approximately $0.5 million.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	During Fiscal 2012, warrants to purchase 3.6 million shares were exercised resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $3.1 million.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	The February 2010, September 2009 and May 2009 underwritten public offerings triggered certain anti-dilution provisions in the warrants outstanding prior to each of the offerings.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	number of shares to be received upon exercise and the exercise price of each warrant previously outstanding were adjusted.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	Following such adjustments, warrants issued in September 2008 and still outstanding as of March 31, 2012 represented warrants to purchase 3.9 million shares at an exercise price of $1.54 per share.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	These warrants are classified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" in the accompanying balance sheets and recorded at estimated fair value with the corresponding charge under the caption "Change in fair value of warrant liability" in the accompanying statement of operations.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The February 2010 and May 2009 underwritten public offerings triggered certain anti-dilution provisions in the warrants outstanding prior to the offering.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	As a result, the number of shares to be received upon exercise and the exercise price of each warrant previously outstanding were adjusted.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	As of March 31, 2012, none of the January 2007 Warrants were outstanding.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	See Note 9 Fair Value Measurements for disclosure regarding the fair value of financial instruments.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table outlines the warrant activity:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_12_ITEM15_P139_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2012 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. Treasury Funds at March 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2011 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	As the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P149_S2	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company adopted the amended provisions of ASC 815 on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in ASC 815.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	Warrants issued by the Company in prior periods with certain antidilution provisions for the holder are no longer considered indexed to the Company's own stock, and therefore no longer qualify for the scope exception and must be accounted for as derivatives.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	These warrants were reclassified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P150_S3	The Company will continue to adjust the warrant liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, at which time the liability will be reclassified to stockholders' equity, or expiration of the warrants.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The fair value of the Company's warrant liability (see Note 8 Stockholders' Equity Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock) recorded in the Company's financial statements is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method and the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market, a Level 3 measurement.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	Volatility is based on the actual market activity of the Company's stock.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants' expected life.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	From time to time, the Company sells common stock warrants that are derivative instruments.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	As discussed above, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on contracts in an entity's own equity that requires the common stock warrants to be classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value at each reporting date recognized in the statement of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liability which is measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
1009759_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014 unless terminated sooner.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit the Company's ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company's capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, (f) change the Company's accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (a) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (b) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon the Company's financial performance, and (c) limitations on the Company's annual capital expenditures.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, the Company was in noncompliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P159_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	As a result of the Company's non-compliance with the financial covenant in the Agreements regarding the Company's net income as of March 31, 2010, Wells Fargo imposed default pricing of an additional 3.0% effective March 1, 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	In addition, as a condition of the further amendment of the Agreements, Wells Fargo restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 11, 2010 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	On November 9, 2010, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to provide for the release by Wells Fargo of the $5.0 million in cash restricted since June 2010 upon the Company's satisfaction of certain conditions.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P160_S3	During Fiscal 2011, Wells Fargo released $3.7 million of the restricted cash.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	On March 25, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements that allows the Company to form one wholly-owned subsidiary in each of Singapore and the United Kingdom provided that the amount of cash and cash equivalents that may be held by, or invested in each such subsidiary is within certain agreed upon limits.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	This amendment also provides that, if requested by Wells Fargo, the Company will grant Wells Fargo a security interest in 65% of the equity interests of each subsidiary to secure indebtedness under the Agreements.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding net income.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	On June 9, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of the Company's noncompliance with this financial covenant as of March 31, 2011 and removed the net worth financial covenant for future periods.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	Additionally, this amendment also set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2012 and authorized the release of the remaining $1.3 million of restricted cash.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Additionally, this amendment made certain changes to the calculation and payment of interest under the Agreements and the financial covenant requiring a specified ratio of minimum cash balances to unreimbursed line of credit advances.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with one of the financial covenants in the Agreements regarding net income.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	On February 8, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements which provided a waiver of the Company's noncompliance with this financial covenant as of December 31, 2011 and set the financial covenants for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P164_S2	On June 12, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, the Company would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P165_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P165_S3	Based on the Company's current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P165_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, the Company would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the sum of daily three month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), which interest rate shall change whenever daily three month LIBOR changes, plus applicable margin.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	Based on the revolving nature of the Company's borrowings and payments, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P167_S3	The Company's borrowing rate at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 was 5.5% and 7.5%, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	The Company incurred $0.2 million in origination fees in 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	These fees were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense through February 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	The Company is also required to pay an annual unused line fee of one-quarter of one percent of the daily average of the maximum line amount and 1.5% interest with respect to each letter of credit issued by Wells Fargo.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S3	These amounts, if any, are also recorded as interest expense by the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S4	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, $10.4 million and $7.1 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S5	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during each of the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $0.8 million, which includes $0.2 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P168_S6	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which includes $0.1 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $27.7 million through Fiscal 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable upon the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company leases offices and manufacturing facilities under various non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S2	The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and renewal options for five-year periods.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S3	Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S4	The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S5	The balance of deferred rent was approximately $0.3 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P170_S6	Rent expense was approximately $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	On August 27, 2009, the Company entered into a second amendment (the "Chatsworth Amendment") to the Lease Agreement, dated December 1, 1999, for leased premises used by the Company for primary office space, engineering testing and manufacturing located in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	The Chatsworth Amendment extends the term of the Lease Agreement from May 31, 2010 to July 31, 2014.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P171_S2	The Company has two five-year options to extend the term of the Lease Agreement beyond July 31, 2014.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P171_S3	The Chatsworth Amendment also sets the monthly base rent payable by the Company under the Lease Agreement at $67,000 per month, with an annual increase in the base rent on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2011, August 1, 2012 and August 1, 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P171_S4	On such dates, the base rent shall increase by 5% of the base rent in effect at the time of the increase or a percentage equivalent to the increase in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	On August 11, 2009, the Company entered into a second amendment (the "Van Nuys Amendment") to the Lease Agreement, dated September 25, 2000, for leased premises used by the Company for engineering testing and manufacturing located in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	The Van Nuys Amendment extends the term of the Lease Agreement from November 30, 2010 to December 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	The Company has one five-year option to extend the term of the Lease Agreement beyond December 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P172_S3	The Van Nuys Amendment also adjusts the monthly base rent payable by the Company under the Lease Agreement to the following: $51,000 per month from April 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010; $56,000 per month from October 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011; and $60,000 per month from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	At March 31, 2012, the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	During the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company entered into a 24-month capital lease to finance approximately $61,000 of computer equipment and an 18-month capital lease to finance approximately $163,000 for a forklift.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P174_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the 18-month capital lease was paid in full.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company purchased office copiers that were financed with notes payable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	The outstanding balance of the notes payable was approximately $0.1 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	The notes bear interest at 11.0% with principal and interest paid monthly through December 2014.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P175_S3	The related office copiers collateralize the notes payable.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred $0.4 million of expense upon renewal of insurance contracts, a portion of which was financed by notes payable.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P179_S1	See Note 14 Acquisition, for discussion of commitments associated with the MPL acquired from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements of $18.7 million through December 2015, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P180_S2	As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	In September 2010, the Company was awarded a grant from the DOE for the research, development and testing of a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P181_S1	Part of the improved efficiency will come from an improved microturbine design, with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and power output of 370 kW. The project is estimated to cost approximately $17.4 million.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P181_S2	The DOE will contribute $5.0 million toward the project, and the Company will incur approximately $12.4 million in research and development expense.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P181_S3	During Fiscal 2012, this project was extended until September 2013.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P181_S4	The Company billed the DOE under the contract for this project a cumulative amount of $0.7 million through March 31, 2012.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	Agreements the Company has with some of its distributors require that if the Company renders parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then the Company is required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P183_S1	While the Company has never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in the Company's product technology could result and yield costs to the Company if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P183_S2	As of March 31, 2012, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	In December 2001, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company, two of its then officers, and the underwriters of the Company's initial public offering.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	The suit purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock during the period from June 28, 2000 to December 6, 2000.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P184_S2	An amended complaint was filed on April 19, 2002.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P184_S3	The plaintiffs allege that the prospectuses for the Company's June 28, 2000 initial public offering and November 16, 2000 secondary offering were false and misleading in violation of the applicable securities laws because the prospectuses failed to disclose the underwriter defendants' alleged agreement to allocate stock in these offerings to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	On October 9, 2002, the plaintiffs dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against the named officers and directors in the action against the Company, pursuant to the terms of Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements entered into with the plaintiffs (the "Tolling Agreements").
1009759_12_ITEM15_P186_S1	Subsequent addenda to the Tolling Agreements extended the tolling period through August 27, 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of "focus cases" and on October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S1	The Company's case is not one of these focus cases.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S2	The underwriter defendants appealed that ruling, and on December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's class certification decision.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S3	On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended complaints against the six focus cases and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S4	On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus cases moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S5	On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P187_S6	The motion for class certification was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	On April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement between the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P188_S1	The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	The settlement "fairness" hearing was held on September 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P189_S1	On October 6, 2009, the District Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the District Court close these actions.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P190_S0	On August 26, 2010, based on the expiration of the tolling period stated in the Tolling Agreements, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Termination of Tolling Agreement and Recommencement of Litigation against the named officers and directors.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P190_S1	The plaintiffs stated to the District Court that they do not intend to take any further action against the named officers and directors at this time.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P190_S2	Appeals of the opinion granting final approval were filed, all of which have been dismissed or settled.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	On October 9, 2007, Vanessa Simmonds, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (the "Washington District Court") against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Merrill Lynch Co., Inc., and Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriters of the Company's initial public offering in June 1999, and the Company's secondary offering of common stock in November 2000, alleging violations of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
1009759_12_ITEM15_P191_S1	The complaint sought to recover from the lead underwriters any "short swing profits" obtained by them in violation of Section 16(b).
1009759_12_ITEM15_P191_S2	The suit names the Company as a nominal defendant, contained no claims against the Company, and sought no relief from the Company.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	Simmonds filed an Amended Complaint on February 27, 2008 (the "Amended Complaint"), naming as defendants Goldman Sachs Co. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner Smith Inc. and again naming Morgan Stanley.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P192_S1	The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Co., Inc. were no longer named as defendants.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Amended Complaint asserted substantially similar claims as those set forth in the initial complaint.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	On July 25, 2008, the Company joined with 29 other issuers to file the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P194_S1	On March 12, 2009, the Washington District Court granted the Issuer Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that Simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on the Company prior to filing her complaint.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P194_S2	In its order, the Washington District Court stated that it would not permit Simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	the issue of whether Simmonds' claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	However, the Washington District Court also granted the Underwriters' Joint Motion to Dismiss with respect to cases involving non-moving issuers, holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers' stockholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	Simmonds filed a Notice of Appeal on April 10, 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	The underwriters subsequently filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, arguing that the dismissal of the claims involving the moving issuers should have been with prejudice because the claims were untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P196_S2	On December 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit") affirmed the Washington District Court's decision to dismiss the moving issuers' cases (including the Company's) on the grounds that plaintiff's demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P196_S3	The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed and remanded the Washington District Court's decision on the underwriters' motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the non-moving issuers' initial public offerings, finding plaintiff's claims were not time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P196_S4	In remanding, the Ninth Circuit advised the non-moving issuers and underwriters to file in the Washington District Court the same challenges to plaintiff's demand letters that moving issuers had filed.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	On December 16, 2010, the underwriters filed a petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P197_S1	Appellant Vanessa Simmonds also filed a petition for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P197_S2	On January 18, 2011, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P197_S3	It further ordered that no further petitions for rehearing may be filed.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P197_S4	On January 26, 2011, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the mandate in all cases (including the Company's and other moving issuers) was stayed for ninety days pending Simmonds' filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	On April 5, 2011, Simmonds filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the adequacy of the pre-suit demand.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P198_S1	On April 15, 2011, underwriter defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit's December 2, 2010 decision relating to the statute of limitations issue.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P198_S2	On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court denied Simmonds' petition regarding the demand issue and granted the underwriters' petition relating to the statute of limitations issue.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P198_S3	Oral arguments on underwriters' petition were heard on November 29, 2011.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P198_S4	On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's holding that petitioner's claims were not time-barred, and remanded the cases to the District Court for proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	Management believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on the Company's business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to additional legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P201_S1	Employees may contribute up to Internal Revenue Service annual limits or, if less, 90% of their eligible compensation.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P201_S2	Employees are fully vested in their contributions to the plan.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	The plan also provides for both Company matching and discretionary contributions, which are determined by the Board of Directors.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P202_S1	The Company began matching 50 cents on the dollar up to 4% of the employee's contributions in October 2006.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P202_S2	Prior to that date, no Company contributions had been made since the inception of the plan.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P202_S3	The Company's match vests 25% a year over four years starting from the employee's hire date.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	In September 2007, the Company entered into a Development and License Agreement (the "Development Agreement") with UTC Power Corporation ("UTCP"), a division of United Technologies Corporation.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P203_S1	The Development Agreement engaged UTCP to fund and support the Company's continued development and commercialization of the Company's 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbine.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P203_S2	Pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, UTCP contributed $12.0 million in cash and approximately $800,000 of in-kind services toward the Company's efforts to develop the C200.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P203_S3	In return, the Company agreed to pay to UTCP an ongoing royalty of 10% of the sales price of the C200 sold to customers other than UTCP until the aggregate of UTCP's cash and in-kind services investment had been recovered and, thereafter, the royalty would be reduced to 5% of the sales price.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P203_S4	In August 2009, the Development Agreement was assigned by UTCP to Carrier Corporation ("Carrier").
1009759_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	The Company recorded the benefits from this Development Agreement as a reduction of R D expenses.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P204_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2010, the Company recognized approximately $1.3 million of such benefits and there were no in-kind services for the year ended March 31, 2010.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P204_S2	In-kind services performed by Carrier under the cost-sharing program were recorded as consulting expense within R D expenses.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P204_S3	The program concluded in June 2009.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P204_S4	The reduction of R D expenses was recognized on a percentage of completion basis, limited by the amount of funding received and/or earned based on milestone deliverables.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	On January 14, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P205_S1	The amendment amends the royalty payment from a certain percentage of the sales prices to a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by the amendment.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P205_S2	Carrier earned $3.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during the year ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P208_S1	The additional consideration was to be paid, at the Company's discretion, in shares of the Company's common stock or cash.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P208_S2	The Company elected to satisfy the amount due on the Second Funding Date with common stock and issued 3,131,313 shares to CPS.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P208_S3	This liability was recorded at fair value on the Closing Date and was accreted to its full settlement value at the Second Funding Date by recording the increase to interest expense.
1009759_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

1009759_12_ITEM15_P274_S0	In connection with the annual report of Capstone Turbine Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), Darren R. Jamison, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Edward I. Reich, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each hereby certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_12_ITEM15_P275_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ("Capstone" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide "on-site power generation" (also called "distributed generation") such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on-site power with lower scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand-alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold primarily through our distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S6	Service is provided primarily by our global distribution network.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P2_S7	Together we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ("FPP").
1009759_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial, and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ("kW") to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our 30 kW ("C30") microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	The 65 kW ("C65") microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100-room hotel while also providing about one-third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S5	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our microturbines combine patented air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S8	Because of our air-bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P4_S9	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our products produce exceptionally clean power.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our C65 was certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our C65 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified in January 2008 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Digester Gas systems were certified in November 2010 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS") and entered into a manufacturing sub-contract agreement and an original equipment manufacturer agreement with selected exclusive rights to package a combined microturbine and waste heat recovery generator product.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry and the 100 kW rating fits well between our C65 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	The 125 kW waste heat recovery generator can be directly fired by the exhaust of six C65 or two C200 microturbines to provide a total of over 500 kW of clean and efficient green power in applications where the microturbine exhaust is not otherwise utilized, such as CHP or CCHP.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after-market parts and services.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users' sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post-commissioning service.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our distributors perform as value-added resellers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	OEMs integrate Capstone's products into their own product solutions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer ("FTI") training and certification program.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Capstone has a factory direct service offering for commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers ("ASPs") and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") refers to Capstone's fiscal years ending March 31 as its "Fiscal" years.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ("C60"), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	We began shipping the C60 Integrated CHP solution in 2003.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	During Fiscal 2013, we booked total orders of $112.6 million for 765 units, or 107.2 megawatts, compared to $122.5 million for 637 units, or 136.3 megawatts, during Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We shipped 628 units with an aggregate of 103.2 megawatts, generating revenue of $102.7 million compared to 627 units with an aggregate of 96.1 megawatts, generating revenue of $89.9 million during Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Total backlog as of March 31, 2013 increased $9.9 million, or 7%, to $148.9 million from $139.0 million at March 31, 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	As of March 31, 2013, we had 816 units, or 162.8 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 679 units, or 158.8 megawatts, at the same date last year.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S5	However, based on historical experience management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P18_S6	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ("BTU") gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features:
1009759_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	advanced combustion technology; patented air-bearing technology; digital power electronics; and remote monitoring capability.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design geared towards manufacturability.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The air-bearing system allows the microturbine's single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum-based lubrication.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Air-bearings use a high-pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	For instance, our electronics control the microturbine's speed, temperature and fuel flow and communicate with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid-connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand-alone mode.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	All control functions are performed digitally.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P26_S4	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; on a stand-alone basis as a voltage source; multipacked to support larger loads as a "virtual single" unit; and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We also offer C65 and C200 ICHP systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	These systems combine the standard C65 and C200 microturbine unit with a Heat Recovery Module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual-mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone's proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications; and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ("CRMS") allows end users to remotely operate and manage the microturbine.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require manual monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to remotely and efficiently monitor performance, power generation and time of operation using our CRMS interface software with standard personal computers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Capstone is currently developing an Internet based system to provide real-time continuous remote monitoring and diagnostics to customers who purchase the service.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	We have expanded our microturbine's functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Capstone microturbine's multi-fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our C65 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its "Rule 21" grid interconnection standard.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site-by-site and utility-by-utility analysis.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre-cleared our microturbines for connection to New York's electric utility grid.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our C65 microturbine now meets the even more stringent CARB 2007 standard for natural gas.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand-alone operation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous-area oil and gas applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back-up generators as small as two kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Within the markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	In the markets we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our microturbines' emissions of commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants") such as nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide ("CO") and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") are lower than those from the on-site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	A study conducted for the US Department of Energy ("DOE") calculated the total potential energy efficiency CHP market in the United States to be over 35.5 gigawatts through 2020.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Capstone released for sale the C65 stand-alone digester product for sale in the renewable energy market segment in 2007.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	This product is targeted at remote villages in third-world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 digester gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	In February 2010, we entered into an agreement with CPS to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generators in exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements through December 2015.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbine for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	In mid-2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	The market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is vast.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	The shale gas market is expected to grow substantially, especially since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Clean Air Act has strict requirements for emissions levels at natural gas sites.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The C200 product is offered for sale configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	Capstone also offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology and information systems companies require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	Capstone's critical power supply offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source ("UPS") solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	We offer two microturbine-powered UPS solutions that support prime and dispatched power options.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	The Capstone UPSource microturbine-powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% reliability when the product has at least one independent backup.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	These systems offer high onsite energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ("HEV") applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric vehicles such as transit buses and trucks.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P61_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship axillaries.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P63_S3	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P63_S4	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our marine customers use both our liquid fueled and natural gas products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary Capstone products: low emissions with no aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment due anywhere from in advance of shipment to 90 days from shipment, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 18 months from shipment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources and mobile products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P67_S3	The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased supply of low price natural gas.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our market focus in Asia and Australia is energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the CHP, CCHP and the oil and gas market.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P70_S3	South Korea and China are areas where renewable energy applications and CHP and CCHP solutions are expected to experience market growth.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	We expect revenue from the European market will continue to be soft as a result of general economic conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	Continued financial instability there could have an adverse effect on our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in South America has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout South America.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our market focus in South America is energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 27%, 19% and 18% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 11%, 26% and 23% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	Additionally, BPC and Regatta Solutions, Inc., one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 35% and 11%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P75_S3	BPC accounted for 44% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	As many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well-established companies, they derive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources, which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	These technologies, which typically have a lower up-front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz Corporation, GE Gas Engines which now includes Waukesha, MAN SE, Tecogen, Inc. and W rtsil Corporation, among others.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind power systems and fuel cells.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including FuelCell Energy Inc., ClearEdge Power, Bloom Energy Corporation, LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, Plug Power Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P84_S3	However, over the medium-to-long term, fuel cell technologies that compete more directly with our products may be introduced.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	Overall, we compete with end users' other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine's ability to:
1009759_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; operate on multiple fuel types; reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases); simplify operation; and control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S6	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S7	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P89_S8	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Capstone continues to engage with Federal and State policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone's low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	In 2012, President Obama called for 40 GW of additional CHP power generation to be installed in the United States by 2020.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Legislation is under consideration by Congress that could stimulate the market for Capstone products by providing incentives to encourage energy efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however, or that it will benefit us if enacted.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	Several state programs were introduced in 2011 and 2012 that provide financial support to combined heat and power projects, and some of these programs have begun to benefit Capstone's customers.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	For example, in New York, Capstone systems are pre-qualified for financial incentives available through the NYSERDA CHP Acceleration Program.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	In Ohio, legislation passed allowing for CHP to qualify as an energy efficiency measure under the state's Energy Efficiency Resource Standard.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	Capstone's customers have utilized trade financing through the Export-Import Bank of the United States ("Ex-Im Bank") in the past, and Capstone has seen more customers use Ex-Im Bank financing for projects in 2011 and 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	While we continue to receive development funding, committed amounts remaining are relatively low.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume, low cost production objectives.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S3	We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S4	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S5	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P96_S6	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	We assemble and test units as well as manufacture air-bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P97_S4	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P98_S2	The cores are subject to a per-unit royalty fee.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P98_S3	As of March 31, 2013, cumulative royalties of $0.4 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	In September 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement (the "Development Agreement") with UTCP, a division of United Technologies Corporation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	The Development Agreement engaged UTCP to fund and support our continued development and commercialization of our 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbine.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	In return we agreed to pay a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by the agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	In August 2009, the Development Agreement was assigned by UTCP to Carrier Corporation ("Carrier").
1009759_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	As of March 31, 2013, cumulative royalties of $9.8 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Carrier.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	On April 28, 2011, we purchased from CPS for $2.3 million the remaining TA100 microturbine inventory that was not consumed as part of the TA100 manufacturing process and acquired the manufacturing equipment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS, which agreement was subsequently assigned to General Electric Company ("GE") in October of 2010.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements through December 2015, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	As of March 31, 2013, we were not in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P102_S3	Loss of exclusivity is dependent upon receiving proper notification from GE as set forth in the agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, R D expenses were $9.0 million, $8.2 million and $7.0 million and were 7%, 7% and 9% of total revenue, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants and the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P103_S2	Benefits from cost-sharing programs were $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	We are focused on making improvements to our C30, C65, and C200 products to be compliant with the new VDE-AR-N 4105 requirements in Europe for decentralized power generation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	These improvements require hardware and software changes to our power inverters to allow power that can be fed into the grid smoothly and efficiently.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	In addition, we continue to work cost reduction activities to improve the direct material costs of our microturbine products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	Current cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base through identification of value added suppliers, working with existing suppliers to identify process and tooling improvements, entering into long term agreements and transitioning parts to low cost manufacturing regions.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P105_S4	Cross functional teams, including internal engineering resources and supplier resources, are used to drive changes with a focus on mutually beneficial long-term relationships.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	In September 2011, we received CARB certification to the 2007 Fossil Fuel Standards for our C200 ICHP microturbine power systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	This standard represents the most stringent emissions standard worldwide set to the Best Available Control Technology ("BACT") for large central power plants.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	To put these emissions levels in perspective, it is challenging to measure the extremely low levels required with today's best emissions measurement equipment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	These emissions levels were achieved through scaling and optimization of Capstone existing lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	Test emissions from both the C30 and C65 natural gas fueled microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P106_S5	The emissions levels are set so low that the California Air Resources Board has not defined any further limit reductions in the foreseeable future.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	We continue to release variants of the C200 product to provide the same features that we offer customers with our C30 and C65 microturbine products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	A liquid fuel version of the C200 product has been developed with Capstone's lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	This technology allows operation on various fuels by changing the injector to achieve the necessary fuel to air ratio mixture, fuel atomization, stability, and exhaust emission levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P108_S2	The control system is modified to incorporate required algorithm modifications for start/stop sequencing and load state operation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone's microturbine products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	Capstone received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum ("CIF") for its C65 Hybrid Uninterruptible Power Supply ("UPS") Microturbine at Syracuse University's data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	The product utilizes Capstone's inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to the customer critical load.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S2	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S3	Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S4	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone's multipack feature.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P110_S5	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	operation year round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P111_S1	In November 2012, we received UL certification for our C65 HUPS microturbine system as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	We are continuing to work on product improvements to our C30 and C65 microturbine products targeted at the hybrid electric bus and truck market.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	Because of Capstone's single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P113_S1	Our current focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid-cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	During the 2011 Hybrid Truck User's Forum in Baltimore Maryland, it was announced that both Kenworth Truck Company and Peterbilt Motors Company are working with Capstone to demonstrate Class 7 and Class 8 microturbine range extended series hybrid trucks.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P114_S1	Both vehicles are concept trucks intended to quantify the performance, efficiency, and economic benefits of a microturbine-based series hybrid solution.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P114_S2	Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P114_S3	In the meantime, Capstone has other hybrid vehicle customers that will benefit from continued development of this technology.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	The C65 Liquid Fuel microturbine demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines ("HDDE").
1009759_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	These requirements are met using test procedures which evaluate emissions performance through start/stop and load transient cycles.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P115_S2	Capstone is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no aftertreatment.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	The C30 Liquid Fuel microturbine met these requirements in March 2009.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	In August 2011, we announced configurations of the C30 and C65 compressed natural gas ("CNG") fueled microturbines that meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On-Road Heavy Duty Diesel Engines for Urban Bus.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P116_S3	Test emissions from both the C30 and C65 Natural Gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	We believe that future products will require the implementation of On Board Diagnostic (OBD) controls to gain certification through the CARB.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	Capstone is working with the Department of Energy ("DOE") on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including the Flexible Fuel Turbine System ("FFTS") and High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P118_S1	The FFTS program is aimed at developing a microturbine system for operation on a range of higher BTU gaseous fuels, including synthetic gas ("SynGas") produced by a biomass gasifier and hydrogen.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S1	We are currently focusing efforts on the development of the High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery system.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S2	In March 2013, Capstone successfully completed proof-of-concept testing of the first C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development to increase power and electrical efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S3	This milestone validates significant design and aero-performance work and marks the most powerful engine ever produced by Capstone in the lab.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S4	Capstone is also working to boost the power capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S5	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits users through lower operating costs.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P119_S6	We expect to commercialize these products into the C200/C1000 product family upon successful project completion and acceptable technical readiness level.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P120_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 106 U.S. and 36 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_13_ITEM1_P120_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2014 and 2027.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is an important component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long-term competitive advantage.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P121_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P122_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P123_S0	As of March 31, 2013, we had 217 employees.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P123_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_13_ITEM1_P124_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.

1009759_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements, or the Agreements, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ("Wells Fargo"), that provide us with a credit facility up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	At March 31, 2013, we had $13.5 million outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, we have pledged our accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral under the Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the Agreements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we had not obtained the default waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The Agreement also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Agreements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue as a going concern on a longer term basis.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer term basis.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain a credit facility acceptable to the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Impairment charges on our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	consumer reluctance to try a new product; regulatory requirements; the cost competitiveness of our microturbines; costs associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines; maintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines; the future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines; economic downturns and reduction in capital spending; consumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality; the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products; and decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We also outsource certain of our components internationally and expect to increase international outsourcing of components.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Current economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Current economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the continued recession in economic activity.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	For example, we have encountered some recent slowing of sales activity in Europe and are discussing with certain of our European distributors the availability of external financing for the purchase of our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Continued financial instability there could have an adverse effect on our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we have and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors; product quality and performance; operating efficiency; product price; availability, price and compatibility of fuel; development of new products and features; and emissions levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and global economic or political instability.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Two of our top distributors are located in Russia and Belgium, and therefore we are particularly susceptible to risks associated with doing business in these two countries.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or the impact thereof on our operations or the market price of our common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective or that future material changes to our internal controls will be effective.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenues from these relationships.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $17.9 million and $18.6 million as of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of Fiscal 2013 was 46 days, compared with 56 days at the end of Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We recorded bad debt expense of $0.3 million and $2.3 million during Fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Horizon and BPC accounted for approximately 27% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As of March 31, 2013, BPC and Horizon represented 35% and 7% of net accounts receivable, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Loss of Horizon, BPC or any other significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S5	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S6	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P64_S7	Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P67_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P67_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P73_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Potential litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We may face litigation relating to labor matters or other matters.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P85_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by risks related to cyber security threats.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P87_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, the services we provide to customers, the competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation or our stock price.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P89_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	At March 31, 2013, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $592.0 million and $283.9 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake-sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P97_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S2	On December 21, 2012, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S3	In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided 180 calendar days, or until June 19, 2013, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S4	On June 10, 2013, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that the closing bid price of our common stock had been $1.00 or greater for the previous ten consecutive business days and that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P99_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P103_S1	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; market sentiment toward alternative energy stocks in general or toward Capstone; changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; conditions or trends in our industry or the overall economy; loss of one or more of our significant customers; errors, omissions or failures by third parties in meeting commitments to us; changes in the market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies; the trading of options on our common stock; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; announcements of significant market events, such as power outages, regulatory changes or technology changes; changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our market; future equity financings; the failure to produce our products on a timely basis in accordance with customer expectations; the inability to obtain necessary components on time and at a reasonable cost; litigation or disputes with customers or business partners; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales or purchases of our common stock; the trading volume of our common stock; developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and decreases in oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P105_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right has been issued for each share of our common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Until the occurrence of certain prescribed events, the rights are not exercisable and are transferable along with, and only with, each share of our common stock and are evidenced by the common stock certificates.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P110_S2	One preferred stock purchase right will also be issued with each share of our common stock we issue in the future until the rights plan expires or is terminated or we redeem or exchange the rights for other property in accordance with the terms of the rights plan or at such time, if any, as the rights separate from each share of our common stock and become exercisable.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, dividends payable in cash in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends or other distributions, including non-cash dividends (payable in kind), declared on our common stock other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The rights plan prohibits the issuance of additional rights after the rights separate from our common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The rights plan is intended to protect our stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us.
1009759_13_ITEM1A_P112_S2	However, the existence of the rights plan may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of us that is not supported by our board of directors.
1009759_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our lease for those premises expires in July 2014, and we have two five-year options to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2017.
1009759_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1009759_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	that would have a material effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "CPST".
1009759_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the low and high sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 6, 2013, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $1.19 per share.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 6, 2013, there were 667 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_13_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant, including approval from Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data shown below have been derived from the audited financial statements of Capstone.
1009759_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Annual Report.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	We increased revenues during Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 despite the challenging economic conditions worldwide.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Management believes that our ongoing efforts to grow and broaden our distribution network along with continued market acceptance of our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine and 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines products were the primary reasons for our revenue growth during the year compared to Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for C200 and C1000 Series microturbines led by the North American natural resources vertical market, while weakness continued in the European market as a result of uncertain global economic conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Domestic demand was strong; sales from our U.S. based distributors during Fiscal 2013 were 45% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	Management believes that sales in the natural resources vertical market will continue to grow and also expects the European market for our products will begin to recover during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	During Fiscal 2013 we received approximately 22 significant orders totaling approximately 54.4 megawatts, continued to make progress in manufacturing cost reduction and had record sales, continuing overall progress on our path to profitability.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	In addition, we continue to make progress on our C250 product development initiative.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	During Fiscal 2013, we experienced a higher rate of warranty claims than expected for C200 and C1000 Series systems.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P2_S8	Management expects warranty claims levels for C200 and C1000 Series systems to decline during Fiscal 2014 as reliability repair programs are completed and the products mature.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Capstone products continue to gain interest in all five of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and transportation products).
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market share in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	The renewable energy market continues to be a significant portion of our business as we shipped products around the globe for applications fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, biogas such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our C1000 Series microturbine continues to drive our near term business success in the oil and gas and other natural resource markets as we gain product acceptance in U.S. shale plays and Russian oil fields.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our critical power supply data center product is performing well, and we continue to focus efforts on gaining market share with this new product.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	Capstone's transportation products market, utilizing microturbines for electric vehicles, is gaining interest for use of our products as range extenders in electric buses, trucks and the marine industry.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near-term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, management closely manages operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	The key drivers to Capstone's success are continued increase in C200 microturbine engine production rates, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	On February 1, 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement ("APA") with Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS") pursuant to which we acquired, subject to an existing license retained by CPS, all of the rights and assets related to the manufacture and sale of the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine generator, including intellectual property, design, tooling, drawings, patents, know-how, distribution agreements and supply agreements.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Pursuant to the APA, the Company issued to CPS 1,550,387 shares of common stock at the closing date on February 1, 2010 and agreed to pay additional consideration of $3.1 million on July 30, 2010 (the "Second Funding Date").
1009759_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	The additional consideration was to be paid, at the Company's discretion, in shares of the Company's common stock or cash.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company elected to satisfy the amount due on the Second Funding Date with common stock and issued 3,131,313 shares to CPS.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	To support our opportunities to grow in our targeted markets, we continue to enhance the reliability and performance of our products by regularly developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	1) Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	During Fiscal 2013, we booked orders for 107.2 megawatts and shipped 103.2 megawatts of products, which combined with our backlog at March 31, 2012, resulted in 162.8 megawatts in backlog at the end of the fiscal year.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our product shipments in Fiscal 2013 were: 55% for use in natural resources applications, 25% for use in energy efficiency applications, 6% for use in renewable energy applications and 14% for use in other applications (including critical power supply and mobile products).
1009759_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Energy efficiency applications use both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Capstone's microturbines can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding area.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no access to an electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbines for a reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users, such as high technology and information systems companies, require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Management believes that Capstone's critical power supply offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric mobile applications, including transit buses and trucks.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship auxiliaries.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	2) Sales and Distribution Channel We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We have a total of 91 distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	In North America, we currently have 32 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	Internationally, outside of North America, we currently have 59 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	We continue to refine the distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S5	3) Service Service is provided primarily by our global distribution network.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P18_S6	Together with our global distribution network we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive FPP.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	In January 2011, we expanded the FPP to include total microturbine plant operations if required by the end use customer.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Capstone provides factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2013 was $35.0 million which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2028.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Service revenue in Fiscal 2013 was approximately 8% of total revenue.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	4) Product Robustness We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance cost to our customers.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, TA100, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	We are currently focusing efforts on enhancing our products to improve reliability, reduce direct material costs, and be compliant with the new stringent European VDE power grid requirements.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	We are also developing a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power ("CHP") system with the DOE.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	The first phase of the development program has successfully achieved 270 kW with a prototype C250 engine.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	Capstone plans to continue development of the engine as well as power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P21_S9	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	6) Cost and Core Competencies We believe that the core competencies of Capstone products are air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our core intellectual property is contained within our air-bearing technology.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone's promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we ship approximately 200 units in a quarter, depending on an assumed product mix.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1009759_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The estimated fair value of the assets are determined using the best information available.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2013 and determined that no impairment was necessary.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ("FIFO") basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write-downs of inventories.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long-term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed-upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days or past payment terms.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is "more likely than not" that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred income tax asset at that time.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The use of Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The term "forfeitures" is distinct from "cancellations" or "expirations" and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	We re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Ultimately, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	As discussed in Note 10 Fair Value Measurements in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements", Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815 requires that our warrants be accounted for as derivative instruments and that we mark the value of our warrant liability to market and recognize the change in valuation in our statement of operations each reporting period.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Determining the warrant liability to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of the warrants.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	We calculate the fair values using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the contractual life of the warrants, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the warrant contractual life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2013 increased $18.2 million, or 17%, to $127.6 million from $109.4 million for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 included increases in revenue of $34.2 million from the North American market, $2.8 million from the Asian market, $2.7 million from the Australian market and $0.7 million from the South American market.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase in the North American market was primarily related to increased revenue in the U.S. shale plays market.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The increases in the Australian, Asian and South American markets were primarily the result of microturbine product sales to certain distributors that did not occur during the same period last year.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $21.3 million from the European market and $0.9 million from the African market.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	We expect revenue from the European market will continue to be soft as a result of general economic conditions.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	the African market was primarily the result of non-recurring microturbine product sales in Fiscal 2012 to certain distributors that did not occur in Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	For Fiscal 2013, revenue from microturbine products increased $12.8 million, or 14%, to $102.7 million from $89.9 million for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Microturbine megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2013 increased 7.1 megawatts, or 7%, to 103.2 megawatts from 96.1 megawatts for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2013 increased to 628 units from 627 units for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	Average revenue per unit increased for Fiscal 2013 to approximately $163,000 compared to approximately $143,000 per unit for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	Megawatts shipped and revenue per unit during Fiscal 2013 increased as a result of higher sales volume for our C30, TA100 and C200 systems and a change in product mix of the C1000 Series systems, offset by lower sales volume for our C65 microturbines.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	For Fiscal 2013, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $5.4 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million from $19.5 million for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase in revenue resulted primarily from higher sales of microturbine parts and service work.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon") accounted for 27% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC") accounted for 11% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The gross margin was $14.4 million, or 11% of revenue, for Fiscal 2013 compared to a gross margin of $5.4 million, or 5% of revenue, for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase in gross margin was primarily related to an $10.6 million improvement resulting from higher volume of C200 and C1000 Series product shipments, microturbine parts and service revenue, and lower direct material costs during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	The $10.6 million improvement and the lower production and service center labor and expenses of $0.4 million were offset by an increase in royalty expense of $1.1 million and warranty expense of $0.9 million.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	Management continues to implement initiatives to address warranty expense and to further reduce direct material costs as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased $0.4 million during Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 primarily as the result of a decrease in freight expense.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Royalty expense increased $1.1 million during Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 as a result of higher sales of our C200 and C1000 Series systems.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	We pay a royalty of a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier which will be reduced by 50% once the aggregate of Carrier's cash and in-kind services investment has been recovered.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	Management expects to reach this milestone during the second quarter of Fiscal 2014, at which time the predetermined fixed rate royalty reduction will occur.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The increase in warranty expense of $0.9 million reflects an increase in the standard warranty provision as a result of an increase in warranty claims related primarily to certain C200 and C1000 Series systems, an increase in reliability repair programs and higher volume of C200 and C1000 Series units under warranty during Fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	Management expects warranty claims levels for C200 and C1000 Series systems to decline as reliability repair programs are completed and these products mature.

1009759_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	The overall increase in R D expenses of $0.8 million resulted from increased supplies expense of $0.8 million, salaries expense of $0.7 million and consulting expense of $0.2 million, offset by increased cost-sharing benefits of $0.9 million.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	There were approximately $1.7 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2013 and $0.8 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2014 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2013 as we continue new product development, product robustness and direct material cost reduction initiatives.

1009759_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	This change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of warrant exercises and revaluing the warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model which is based primarily upon the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	This revaluation of the warrant liability has no impact on our cash balances.

1009759_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $232.6 million at March 31, 2013 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.

1009759_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	The increase in the South American and African markets was primarily because of our continued efforts to improve distribution channels.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $2.1 million from the Asian market and $1.0 million from the Australia market as a result of non-recurring microturbine product sales for specific projects that had occurred in the same period last year.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	For Fiscal 2012, revenue from microturbine products increased $23.6 million, or 36%, to $89.9 million from $66.3 million for Fiscal 2011.

1009759_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	On September 18, 2012, the Company entered into an Investor Agreement with one of the investors in the 2012 registered direct offering pursuant to which the investor agreed to (i) waive the condition precedent to the Company's exercise of the Put Option requiring the arithmetic average of the average daily trading volumes during the measurement period set forth in the subscription agreement between the Company and the investor and on the exercise date be not less than 1.75 million shares and (ii) amend the subscription agreement to provide that the purchase price of the additional shares during the first exercise period would be discounted pursuant to a formula that resulted in a purchase price for the first exercise period of $0.94 per share.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	Additionally, pursuant to the Investor Agreement, the Company agreed to amend the exercise price of the warrant originally issued to $1.26.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	The exercise of the Put Option resulted in net proceeds of $4.2 million.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	On February 21, 2013, the Company chose not to exercise the second of the two Put Options because of its improved cash position and its desire to avoid stockholder dilution.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units net of employee stock purchases resulted in approximately $19,000 of net cash used during Fiscal 2013, compared with $0.7 million of net cash generated during Fiscal 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo, which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The amount actually available to us may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, we granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of our assets.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	As of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, $13.5 million and $10.4 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, our capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (f) change our accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (a) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (b) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon the Company's financial performance, and (c) limitations on our annual capital expenditures.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements and prior to April 1, 2012, we were not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	Based on our current forecasts, management believes we will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	If a covenant violation were to occur, management would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S4	On June 7, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P110_S5	As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Although we made progress on direct material cost reduction efforts during Fiscal 2013, we were behind schedule on our planned cost reductions at the end of Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	Our working capital requirements were in accordance with our plan for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months; however, if our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S3	We could seek to raise funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S4	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S5	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P111_S6	In addition, the equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	the market acceptance of our products and services; our business, product and capital expenditure plans; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; our competitors' response to our products and services; our relationships with customers, distributors, dealers and project resellers; and our customers' ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $17.9 million and $18.5 million as of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding ("DSO") decreased by 10 days, to 46 days as of March 31, 2013 compared to 56 days as of March 31, 2012.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	The change in DSO was largely the result of the shift in mix of sales away from European customers who historically have longer payment terms towards customers in the United States and Latin America who have shorter payment terms or are required to pay before shipment.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	We recorded bad debt expense of $0.3 million, $2.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P115_S2	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	At March 31, 2013, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	As of March 31, 2013, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $31.5 million through Fiscal 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	As of March 31, 2013, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable under the Credit Facility is $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	On February 1, 2010, the Company and CPS also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems from CPS, which agreement was subsequently assigned to General Electric Company ("GE") in October of 2010.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	In exchange for certain minimum purchase requirements of $18.7 million through December 2015, we have exclusive rights to sell the zero-emission waste heat recovery generator for all microturbine applications and for applications 500 kW or lower where the source of heat is the exhaust of a reciprocating engine used in a landfill application.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	As of March 31, 2013, we were not in compliance with the minimum purchase requirements in the agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P121_S3	Loss of exclusivity is dependent upon receiving proper notification from GE as set forth in the agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we may enter into transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to changes in the interest rates results primarily from our Credit Facility borrowings.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2013, we had $13.5 million of outstanding indebtedness subject to interest rate fluctuations.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Based on these borrowings as of March 31, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the then current LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $0.1 million on an annual basis.
1009759_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from period to period and therefore could result in additional interest.
1009759_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Annual Report beginning at page F-1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2013, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2013 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The report of KPMG LLP follows.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended March 31, 2013 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited Capstone Turbine Corporation's (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Capstone Turbine Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P8_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, Capstone Turbine Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_13_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related financial statement schedule, and our report dated June 13, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company allocates the total contract value among each element based on a selling price hierarchy as follows, where the selling price is based on (i) vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), (ii) third party evidence ("TPE") or (iii) best estimate of selling price if VSOE or TPE are not available.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Revenue is the amount related to each element or recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policies discussed above.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company accounts for grant distributions and development funding as offsets to R D expenses and both are recorded as the related costs are incurred.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	Total offsets to R D expenses amounted to $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P115_S5	Subject to certain exceptions specified in the rights agreement, the rights will separate from the common stock and will be exercisable upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by institutional or certain other stockholders, or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as the Company's Board of Directors shall determine) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer (other than certain permitted offers described in the rights agreement) that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	On June 9, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously approved a second amendment to the rights agreement, which was approved by the stockholders in August 2011.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	expire on the 30th day after the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders unless continuation of the rights agreement is approved by the stockholders at that meeting.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	The second amendment also provides for an update to the definition of "Beneficial Owner" to include derivative interests in the calculation of a stockholder's ownership.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	In addition, the second amendment clarifies the manner in which the exchange provision of the rights agreement shall be effected.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	The rights are intended to protect the Company's stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	The rights, however, should not affect any prospective offeror willing to make an offer at a fair price and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, as determined by the Board of Directors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	The rights should also not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Effective March 5, 2012, the Company completed a registered direct placement in which it sold 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, and warrants to purchase 22.6 million shares of common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.55 per share, at a price of $1.11 per unit (the "2012 Warrants").
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S2	The 2012 Warrants expire on October 31, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S3	In addition, the Company obtained the right to require investors in the offering to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of 19.0 million additional shares of common stock from the Company (the "Put Options") during two option exercise periods, the first such option exercise period beginning September 10, 2012 and the second such option exercise period beginning March 4, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S4	Each Put Option was subject to certain conditions which reduced the number of shares that could be sold or eliminate the Put Option.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S5	These conditions included a minimum volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and a minimum average trading volume of the Company's common shares during the 30 trading days prior to the exercise of the Put Option.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P120_S6	The March 2012 sale resulted in net proceeds of approximately $23.1 million net of direct incremental costs of approximately $1.9 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	On September 18, 2012, the Company entered into an Investor Agreement with one of the investors in the 2012 registered direct offering pursuant to which the investor agreed to (i) waive the condition precedent to the Company's exercise of the Put Option requiring the arithmetic average of the average daily trading volumes during the measurement period set forth in the subscription agreement between the Company and the investor and on the exercise date be not less than 1.75 million shares and (ii) amend the subscription agreement to provide that the purchase price of the additional shares during the first exercise period would be discounted pursuant to a formula that resulted in a purchase price for the first exercise period of $0.94 per share.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	Additionally, pursuant to the Investor Agreement, the Company agreed to amend the exercise price of the 2012 Warrants originally issued to the Investor to $1.26.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P121_S2	The exercise of the first Put Option resulted in net proceeds of $4.2 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P121_S3	The 2012 Warrants still outstanding as of March 31, 2013 provided for the purchase of 22.6 million shares at a weighted average exercise price of $1.41 per share.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	On February 21, 2013, the Company entered into a letter agreement (each a "Letter Agreement" and, collectively, the "Letter Agreements") with each of the investors in the March 5, 2012 registered direct offering.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, the parties evidenced their mutual agreement that the Company would not exercise any portion of the second Put Option.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Company chose not to exercise the second of the two Put Options because of its improved cash position and its desire to avoid stockholder dilution.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Effective January 9, 2012, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with two holders of warrants issued by the Company on January 24, 2007 (the "2007 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for fees in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.3 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of these 2007 Warrants was approximately $1.6 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Effective November 21, 2011, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with (i) two holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 17, 2009 (the "September 2009 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 5.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, (ii) four holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 17, 2008 (the "2008 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock and (iii) six holders of 2007 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the September 2009 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the September 2009 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.34 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $5.4 million, the 2008 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the 2008 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.60 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.2 million and the 2007 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $1.8 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	The net proceeds to the Company, in connection with the exercise of the September 2009 Warrants, the 2008 Warrants and the 2007 Warrants, were approximately $8.4 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P124_S3	The 2008 Warrants to purchase an additional 0.5 million shares were subsequently exercised on November 22, 2011 at the existing exercise price of $1.60 in exchange for a fee of approximately $0.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $0.4 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	Effective March 9, 2011, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with (i) the only two holders of warrants issued by the Company on May 7, 2009 (the "May 2009 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 3.6 million shares of the Company's common stock, (ii) one holder of 2008 Warrants to purchase 0.4 million shares of the Company's common stock and (iii) four holders of 2007 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8.5 million shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the May 2009 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the May 2009 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $0.95 per share in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $1.0 million, the 2008 Warrant holder agreed to exercise the 2008 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.60 per share in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $0.2 million and the 2007 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.17 per share in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S2	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of the May 2009 Warrants, the 2008 Warrants and the 2007 Warrants, after deducting expenses of approximately $0.4 million, was approximately $11.2 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S3	Immediately prior to the exercise of these warrants, the Company revalued the warrants and recorded a charge of $6.9 million to operations during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S4	The induced exercise of the warrants resulted in a reduction of the charge to operations by $1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P125_S5	The exercise of these warrants resulted in a reduction of the warrant liability of $9.7 million.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	The following table outlines the warrant activity:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P127_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_13_ITEM15_P127_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2013 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. Treasury Funds at March 31, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2012 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	As the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company adopted the amended provisions of ASC 815 on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in ASC 815.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	Warrants issued by the Company in prior periods with certain antidilution provisions for the holder are no longer considered indexed to the Company's own stock, and therefore no longer qualify for the scope exception and must be accounted for as derivatives.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	These warrants were reclassified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P138_S3	The Company will continue to adjust the warrant liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, at which time the liability will be reclassified to stockholders' equity, or expiration of the warrants.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	The fair value of the Company's warrant liability (see Note 9 Stockholders' Equity Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock) recorded in the Company's financial statements is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method and the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market, volatility and expected life, a Level 3 measurement.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	Volatility is based on the actual market activity of the Company's stock.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants' expected life.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	From time to time, the Company sells common stock warrants that are derivative instruments.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	As discussed above, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on contracts in an entity's own equity that requires the common stock warrants to be classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value at each reporting date recognized in the statement of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liability which is measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P145_S1	The Agreements will terminate in accordance with their terms on September 30, 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit the Company's ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company's capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, (f) change the Company's accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (a) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (b) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon the Company's financial performance which was $15.0 million as of March 31, 2013, and (c) limitations on the Company's annual capital expenditures.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	The Agreement also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on the Company's business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P146_S3	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements and prior to April 1, 2012, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P147_S2	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, the Company would not have been able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	Based on the Company's current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S3	If a covenant violation were to occur, the Company would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S4	On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P148_S5	As of March 31, 2013 the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the sum of daily three month London Inter Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), which interest rate shall change whenever daily three month LIBOR changes, plus applicable margin.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P151_S1	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P151_S2	The Company's borrowing rate at March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012 was 5.4% and 5.5%, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company incurred $0.1 million in origination fees in connection with a September 2011 amendment to the Agreements that increased borrowing capacity and extended the maturity date of the line of credit.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	These fees were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense through September 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S2	The Company is also required to pay an annual unused line fee of one-quarter of one percent of the daily average of the maximum line amount and 1.5% interest with respect to each letter of credit issued by Wells Fargo.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S3	These amounts, if any, are also recorded as interest expense by the Company.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S4	As of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, $13.5 million and $10.4 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S5	As of March 31, 2013, approximately $40,000 was available for additional borrowing.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S6	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2013 was $0.7 million, which includes $0.1 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P152_S7	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during each of the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $0.8 million, which includes $0.2 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $31.5 million through Fiscal 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not scheduled; therefore amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable upon the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company leases offices and manufacturing facilities under various non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S1	All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S2	The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and renewal options for five-year periods.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S3	Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S4	The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S5	The balance of deferred rent was approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P154_S6	Rent expense was approximately $2.1 million, $2.1 million and $2.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	On August 27, 2009, the Company entered into a second amendment (the "Chatsworth Amendment") to the Lease Agreement, dated December 1, 1999, for leased premises used by the Company for primary office space, engineering testing and manufacturing located in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	The Chatsworth Amendment extends the term of the Lease Agreement from May 31, 2010 to July 31, 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P155_S2	The Company has two five-year options to extend the term of the Lease Agreement beyond July 31, 2014.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P155_S3	The Chatsworth Amendment also sets the monthly base rent payable by the Company under the Lease Agreement at $67,000 per month, with an annual increase in the base rent on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2011, August 1, 2012 and August 1, 2013.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	shall increase by 5% of the base rent in effect at the time of the increase or a percentage equivalent to the increase in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	On March 28, 2013, the Company and Prologis, L.P., formerly known as AMB Property, L.P., entered into a third amendment (the "Van Nuys Amendment") to the Lease Agreement dated September 25, 2000, for leased premises used by the Company for engineering testing and manufacturing located in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P157_S1	The Van Nuys Amendment extends the term of the Lease Agreement from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2017.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P157_S2	The Amendment also adjusts the monthly base rent payable by the Company under the Lease Agreement to the following: $60,000 per month from January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015 and $65,000 per month from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	At March 31, 2013, the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the Company incurred $0.5 million in connection with the renewal of insurance contracts, which was financed by a note payable.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	The note bears interest at rate of 2.2% per annum with principal and interest paid monthly through August 2013.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	Agreements the Company has with some of its distributors require that if the Company renders parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then the Company is required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P164_S1	While the Company has never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in the Company's product technology could result and yield costs to the Company if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P164_S2	As of March 31, 2013, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P173_S1	The Company incurred $0.1 million of costs during Fiscal 2010 related to the acquisition of the MPL.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P173_S2	These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	In October 2010, General Electric Company purchased certain assets of CPS, including the 125 kW waste heat recovery generator systems product line.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P520_S0	Capstone employees who have questions regarding business conduct or possible violations and/or want to report a potential violation should contact the Corporate Ethics Manager who has direct access to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, as needed.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P520_S1	All inquiries and/or reporting violations are confidential and may be made anonymously.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P520_S2	You may contact the Corporate Ethics Manager via e-mail, mail, or telephone:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P521_S0	Members of the Board of Directors may contact the Chair of the Audit Committee directly.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P521_S1	This Code supplements, and must be read together with, the policies and procedures contained in Capstone s Employee Handbook, as amended from time-to-time.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S0	Directors and employees are expected to make or participate in business decisions and actions in the course of their employment with Capstone based solely on the best interests of the company as a whole, free of conflicts of interest.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S1	A conflict of interest may occur if your outside activities or personal interests influence or appear to influence your ability to make objective decisions in the course of your job responsibilities.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S2	A conflict of interest may also exist if the demands of any outside activities hinder or distract you from the performance of your job or cause you to use Capstone s resources for purposes other than Capstone s.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S3	It is your obligation to ensure that your interests remain free of conflicts in the performance of your responsibilities at Capstone.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S4	It is impossible to identify all potential conflicts of interests, but they may include investments that may create a conflict, the outside development of technology or intellectual property within Capstone s industry, outside directorships or serving on technical advisory boards and the receipt or giving of any gift.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S5	Any potential conflict of interest must be reported as soon as it is recognized.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S6	No employee shall accept a position as a director, officer, partner or employee with any other non-Capstone business, without the consent of the Corporate Ethics Manager.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P522_S7	If you have any question as to whether any action may create a conflict of interest, you must first discuss the matter with our Corporate Ethics Manager.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P523_S0	Capstone may receive or evaluate appropriate complimentary products or services.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P523_S1	Capstone may also make a gift of equipment to a company or organization, provided that the gift is openly given, with full knowledge by the company or organization, and is consistent with applicable law.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P523_S2	Any gifts received should be turned over to the Corporate Ethics Manager for appropriate disposition.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P523_S3	In all cases, the exchange of gifts will be conducted so there is no appearance of impropriety.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P524_S0	Gifts may only be given in accordance with applicable laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ).
1009759_13_ITEM15_P524_S1	No gifts given or received may exceed $50 in value.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P525_S0	Directors and employees of Capstone stand in a fiduciary relationship to Capstone and must advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P525_S1	It is a breach of this fiduciary duty for any such person to take advantage of a business opportunity for his or her own or another person s personal profit or benefit when the opportunity is within the corporate powers of Capstone and when the opportunity is of present or potential practical advantage to Capstone unless Capstone s Board of Directors knowingly elects not to avail itself of such opportunity and such person s participation is approved in advance by the Board of Directors.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P525_S2	If such a person appropriates such a Capstone corporate opportunity, Capstone may claim the benefit of the transaction or business and such person exposes himself or herself to liability in this regard.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P526_S0	It is essential that every director and employee maintain confidentiality regarding information and trade secrets encountered at work.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P526_S1	Confidential information may not be released to or discussed with outside parties or with other employees who do not have a valid business reason to know the information.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P526_S2	Capstone s business and business relationships depend upon the confidential and proprietary nature of our information and of those with whom we do business - customers, vendors, suppliers, agents, and others.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P526_S3	The use of confidential and proprietary information (whether Capstone s or a third-party s) should be covered by a written confidential disclosure agreement or non-disclosure agreement.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S0	As a public company, Capstone s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission must be accurate and timely.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S1	Each Capstone employee is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of our documents and records, not only to comply with regulatory and legal requirements but also to ensure that records are available to defend our business practices and actions.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S2	No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S3	Depending on their position with Capstone, employees may be called upon to provide information to assure that the Company s public reports are complete, fair and understandable.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S4	Every employee, therefore, plays a role in accurate and ethical financial reporting, and is accountable for that responsibility.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P527_S5	Furthermore, the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Chief Executive Officer applies to all Senior Financial Officers, as defined therein, and is attached hereto as Exhibit A for reference purposes.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P528_S0	Directors and employees must read and comply with Capstone s Insider Trading Policy, which details the trading restrictions imposed on any director, employee, or any person related to that director or employee.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P528_S1	Trading restrictions are imposed when a director or employee is in possession of material, non-public information relating to Capstone or any other company, including our customers or suppliers, if such material, non-public information was obtained in the course of the director s or employee s service to, or employment by, Capstone.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P529_S0	As a U.S.-based company with international operations, Capstone is subject to laws and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P529_S1	In addition to contradicting this Code, violation of governing laws and regulations subjects Capstone (and, in many cases, the individual who caused the violation) to significant risk in the form of fines, penalties and damaged reputation.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P529_S2	Each employee, therefore, must comply with applicable laws, regulations and corporate policies.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P530_S0	Capstone requires full compliance with the FCPA by all of its employees, consultants, agents, distributors, and resellers.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P531_S0	The anti-bribery and corrupt payment provisions of the FCPA make illegal any corrupt offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization to pay any money, gift or anything of value to any foreign official, or any foreign political party, candidate or official, for the purpose of:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P532_S0	Inducing the foreign official or party to use influence to affect a decision of a foreign government or agency, in order to obtain or retain business for anyone, or direct business to anyone.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P533_S0	Export of design, development, and production technology is subject to national security, foreign policy, and anti-terrorism laws and regulations.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P533_S1	Employees will obtain written authorization from Capstone s Senior Vice President, Engineering and Operations before providing design, development, or production technology to other countries, or nationals of other countries.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P534_S0	Capstone s policy is to comply fully with customs laws, regulations and policies in all countries where Capstone does business.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P534_S1	Accurate customs information on shipping documents is required for all international shipments.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P535_S0	The economy of the U.S., and of most nations in which Capstone does business, is based on the principle that competition and profit will produce high-quality goods at fair prices.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P535_S1	To ensure that this principle is played out in the marketplace, most countries have laws prohibiting certain business practices that could inhibit effective competition.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P536_S0	Capstone employees should understand that special requirements might apply when contracting with any government body (including national, state, provincial, municipal, or other similar government divisions in local jurisdictions).
1009759_13_ITEM15_P536_S1	Because government officials are obligated to follow specific codes of conduct and laws, special care will be taken in government contracts.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P536_S2	These contracts must have requisite legal review and approval.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P537_S0	No Capstone assets may be contributed to any political candidate, political actions committee (aka PAC ), political party, or ballot measure without the permission of the Corporate Ethics Manager.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P537_S1	Of course, Capstone directors and employees may participate in any political activities of their choice on an individual basis, with their own money and on their own time.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P538_S0	Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks and patents.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P538_S1	Capstone employees may sometimes need to use third-party copyrighted material to perform their jobs.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P538_S2	Before such third-party material may be used, appropriate authorization from the copyright holder will be obtained.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P538_S3	It is against Capstone policy and it may be unlawful for any employee to copy, reproduce, scan, digitize, broadcast, or modify third-party copyrighted material, unless written permission from the copyright holder has been obtained prior to the proposed use.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P539_S0	One of our key environmental goals is to conduct our operations in an environmentally responsible manner.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P539_S1	We are committed to reducing any negative environmental impact of our company by working together with the government, industry and our customers to develop policies and practices that will ensure a healthy environment for present and future generations.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P540_S0	Any waiver of this Code may be made only by the Board of Directors to the extent necessary and warranted and will be promptly disclosed if required by law or regulation of any applicable securities exchange or market.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P541_S0	Employees are encouraged to talk to the Corporate Ethics Manager, supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel about observed illegal or unethical behavior and when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P541_S1	Capstone will not tolerate retaliation for reports made in good faith, and provides full protection for those reporting violations.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P541_S2	Anyone who retaliates or attempts to retaliate against a reporting employee will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P541_S3	Employees are expected to cooperate in internal investigations of misconduct.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P542_S0	Employees must read Capstone s Business Conduct Reporting Methods in Addendum 1 of the Employee Handbook, which describes Capstone s procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Audit Committee regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P542_S1	Any employee may submit a good faith concern regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters without fear of dismissal or retaliation of any kind.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P543_S0	The Board of Directors, through the Corporate Ethics Manager and/or the Audit Committee, will investigate all reported concerns promptly, fairly and confidentially to the extent possible.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P543_S1	All employees are expected to cooperate fully in internal investigations of misconduct.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P543_S2	The Board, or the Audit Committee, will assess any findings from the investigation and recommend appropriate discipline, up to and including possible termination, corrective action or other changes that need to be made.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P544_S0	This Code is not intended to be all-inclusive.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P544_S1	All employees are required to comply with each of the rules, regulations and policies outlined above, as well as others adopted by Capstone in the exercise of its right to manage its business.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S0	A reasonable and practical standard of ethical behavior in business decisions and actions is that which would not be embarrassing to you, your family, or Capstone, if it were revealed publicly.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S1	If you have any doubt about what you re doing, don t do it.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S2	No resource is more important to Capstone than the contributions made by its employees.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S3	We strive to create and maintain a work environment that fosters honesty, personal growth, teamwork, open communication and a dedication to our values.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S4	Our employees are the source from which our ideas, actions and performance flow.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P545_S5	The full potential of Capstone is best realized in an environment that breeds fairness, self-fulfillment, teamwork and dedication to excellence.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P546_S0	Remember, your words, as well as your actions, illustrate your commitment to ethical and lawful behavior and adherence to the policies of Capstone.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P547_S0	Misconduct by a few can discredit and harm our company s reputation.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P547_S1	Each individual is ultimately responsible for his or her own ethical practices.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P547_S2	By working together, each of us can contribute to the continuing growth, quality, productivity and SUCCESS of Capstone.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P552_S4	The Code provides principles to which the Senior Financial Officers are expected to adhere and which they are expected to advocate.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P555_S0	The Code is neither a contract nor a legal document that creates a contractual relationship.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P555_S1	This Code does not summarize all of our policies.
1009759_13_ITEM15_P555_S2	Senior Financial Officers must also comply with our other policies, including those set forth in our Code of Conduct.

1009759_13_ITEM15_P583_S0	In connection with the annual report of Capstone Turbine Corporation (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), Darren R. Jamison, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Edward I. Reich, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each hereby certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_13_ITEM15_P584_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ("Capstone" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide "on-site power generation" (also called "distributed generation") such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on-site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand-alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P2_S6	Together we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ("FPP").
1009759_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial, and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ("kW") to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our 30 kW ("C30") microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	The 65 kW ("C65") microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100-room hotel while also providing about one-third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S5	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our microturbines combine patented air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S8	Because of our air-bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P4_S9	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our products produce exceptionally clean power.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our C65 was certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our C65 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified in January 2008 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Digester Gas systems were certified in November 2010 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS").
1009759_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after-market parts and services.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users' sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post-commissioning service.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our distributors perform as value-added resellers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	OEMs integrate Capstone's products into their own product solutions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer ("FTI") training and certification program.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Capstone has a factory direct service offering for commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers or, ASPs, and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") refers to Capstone's fiscal years ending March 31 as its "Fiscal" years.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ("C60"), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We began shipping the C60 Integrated CHP solution in 2003.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO-sized container.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we booked total orders of $131.5 million for 675 units, or 135.3 megawatts, compared to $112.6 million for 765 units, or 107.2 megawatts, during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We shipped 671 units with an aggregate of 109.9 megawatts, generating revenue of $108.8 million compared to 628 units with an aggregate of 103.2 megawatts, generating revenue of $102.7 million during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	as of March 31, 2014 increased $22.7 million, or 15%, to $171.6 million from $148.9 million at March 31, 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	As of March 31, 2014, we had 820 units, or 188.2 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 816 units, or 162.8 megawatts, at the same date last year.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ("BTU") gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features:
1009759_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	advanced combustion technology; patented air-bearing technology; digital power electronics; and remote monitoring capability.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design geared towards manufacturability.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	The air-bearing system allows the microturbine's single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum-based lubrication.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Air-bearings use a high-pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	For instance, our electronics control the microturbine's speed, temperature and fuel flow and communicate with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid-connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand-alone mode.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; on a stand-alone basis as a voltage source; multipacked to support larger loads as a "virtual single" unit; and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We also offer C65 and C200 ICHP systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	These systems combine the standard C65 and C200 microturbine unit with a heat recovery module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual-mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone's proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	start the turbogenerator and manage its load; coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid; manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine; convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications; and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition, our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ("CRMS") allows end users to remotely operate and manage the microturbine.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require on-site monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to remotely and efficiently monitor performance, power generation and time of operation using our CRMS interface software with standard personal computers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Capstone is currently developing an Internet-based system to provide real-time continuous remote monitoring and diagnostics to customers who purchase the service.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have expanded our microturbine's functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Capstone microturbine's multi-fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our C65 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its "Rule 21" grid interconnection standard.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site-by-site and utility-by-utility analysis.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre-cleared our microturbines for connection to New York's electric utility grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our C65 microturbine now meets the even more stringent CARB 2007 standard for natural gas.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand-alone operation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous-area oil and gas applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back-up generators as small as 2 kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Within the markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	In the markets we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	Our microturbines' emissions of commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants"), such as nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide ("CO") and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs"), are lower than those from the on-site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	A study conducted for the US Department of Energy ("DOE") calculated the total potential energy efficiency CHP market in the United States to be over 35.5 gigawatts through 2020.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	The microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Capstone released for sale the C65 stand-alone digester product for sale in the renewable energy market segment in 2007.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	This product is targeted at remote villages in third-world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 digester gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbine for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	In mid-2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	The addressable market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is significant.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	The shale gas market is expected to grow substantially, especially since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Clean Air Act has strict requirements for emissions levels at natural gas sites.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The C200 product is offered for sale configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	Capstone also offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology, health care and information systems facilities require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies ("UPS") to protect critical loads from momentary power disturbances along with backup diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Capstone offers an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Capstone has developed the world's only microturbine powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT-grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and backup diesel generators.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	We offer two microturbine-powered UPS solutions.

1009759_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent backup.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our microturbine-powered UPS solutions are UL listed.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P58_S4	These integrated solutions are ideal for new construction or facility expansion and are typically installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency and reduce operating costs compared with traditional solutions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than ten seconds.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Capstone microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line-interactive continuous power solution.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ("HEV") applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric vehicles such as transit buses and trucks.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship axillaries.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our marine customers use both our liquid fueled and natural gas products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Liquefied natural gas ("LNG") is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary Capstone products: low emissions with no aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment due anywhere from in advance of shipment to 90 days from shipment, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 18 months from shipment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power and mobile products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas and public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Recent energy reform in Mexico has the potential to open new market opportunities in the energy market.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Capstone's strategy in Mexico is to develop distributors that have demonstrated commitment and proficiency over a period of years to represent Capstone across various market verticals.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P69_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P69_S4	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.

1009759_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	For more information, see "Risk Factors" beginning on Page 14 of this Form 10-K.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for Capstone based on a number of factors including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	While Capstone has distributors in nearly all South American countries, management is focused on what we consider to be the top markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	Our target markets in South America are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ("E-Finity), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 17%, 11% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 12%, 27% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P78_S3	Additionally, BPC, Electro Mecanique Industries ("EMI"), one of the Company's distributors in the Middle East and Africa, and E-Finity accounted for 26%, 18% and 16%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P78_S4	BPC and Regatta Solutions, Inc., one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 35% and 11%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well-established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	These technologies, which typically have a lower up-front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz Corporation, GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, Tecogen, Inc. and W rtsil Corporation, among others.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind power systems and fuel cells.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	However, over the medium-to-long term, fuel cell technology companies may introduce products that compete more directly with our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Overall, we compete with end users' other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine's ability to:
1009759_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; operate on multiple fuel types; reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases); simplify operation; and control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S6	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S7	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P92_S8	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Capstone continues to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone's low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Linda Sanchez, U.S. Representative for California's 38th congressional district recently introduced H.R. 4428, or the American Microturbine Manufacturing and Clean Energy Deployment Act of 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	This legislation may stimulate the market for Capstone products by increasing the investment tax credit available to microturbine projects.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	In the wake of numerous destructive storms, several state and local governments are putting greater value in resilient distributed generation resources, including CHP and microgrids.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	and exemptions from grid usage charges for distributed generation technologies, arguing that these policies shift costs to other rate payers.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	While we continue to receive development funding, committed amounts remaining are relatively low.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P98_S3	There are certain recent federal funding solicitations that may support microturbine development.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P98_S4	We cannot provide any assurance that any proposal Capstone submits will be funded.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume and low cost production objectives.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S2	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S3	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S4	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S5	We have an on-going program to develop alternative back-up suppliers for sole source parts.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S6	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S7	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S8	We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S9	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S10	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P99_S11	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	We have a combined total of approximately 109,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	We assemble and test units as well as manufacture air-bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S3	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S4	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P100_S5	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	The cores are subject to a per-unit royalty fee.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	As of March 31, 2014, cumulative royalties of $0.5 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	In September 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement (the "Development Agreement") with UTCP, a division of United Technologies Corporation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	The Development Agreement engaged UTCP to fund and support our continued development and commercialization of our 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbine.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	In return we agreed to pay a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by the agreement.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	In August 2009, the Development Agreement was assigned by UTCP to Carrier Corporation ("Carrier").
1009759_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	As of March 31, 2014, cumulative royalties of $13.4 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Carrier.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, R D expenses were $9.0 million, $9.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively, and include 7%, 7% and 7% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as Department of Energy ("DOE") grants and the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	Benefits from cost-sharing programs were $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $0.8 million for Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P105_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	We are focused on making improvements to our C30, C65, and C200 products to be compliant with the new low and medium voltage grid inter-connect requirements in Europe for decentralized power generation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	These improvements require hardware and software changes to our power inverters to allow power that can be fed into the grid smoothly and efficiently.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, we continue to work cost reduction activities to improve the direct material costs of our microturbine products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P106_S3	Current cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base through identification of value added suppliers, working with existing suppliers to identify process and tooling improvements, entering into long term agreements and transitioning parts to low cost manufacturing regions.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P106_S4	Cross functional teams, including internal engineering resources and supplier resources, are used to drive changes with a focus on mutually beneficial long-term relationships.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	In September 2011, we received CARB certification to the 2007 Fossil Fuel Standards for our C200 ICHP microturbine power systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	This standard represents the most stringent emissions standard worldwide set to the Best Available Control Technology ("BACT") for large central power plants.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P107_S2	To put these emissions levels in perspective, it is challenging to measure the extremely low levels required with today's best emissions measurement equipment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P107_S3	These emissions levels were achieved through scaling and optimization of Capstone existing lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	We continue to release variants of the C200 product to provide the same features that we offer customers with our C30 and C65 microturbine products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	A liquid fuel version of the C200 product has been developed with Capstone's lean premix combustion technology.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	This technology allows operation on various fuels by changing the injector to achieve the necessary fuel to air ratio mixture, fuel atomization, stability, and exhaust emission levels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P109_S2	The control system is modified to incorporate required algorithm modifications for start/stop sequencing and load state operation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone's microturbine products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	Capstone received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for its C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University's data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	The product utilizes Capstone's inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to the customer critical load.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone's multipack feature.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P112_S2	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P112_S3	Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, the low emissions of the Capstone Hybrid UPS product allow for continuous operation year round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P112_S4	In November 2012, we received UL certification for our C65 Hybrid UPS microturbine system as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	We are continuing to work on product improvements to our C30 and C65 microturbine products targeted at the hybrid electric bus and truck market.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	Because of Capstone's single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P114_S1	Our current focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid-cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	During the 2011 Hybrid Truck User's Forum in Baltimore Maryland, it was announced that both Kenworth Truck Company and Peterbilt Motors Company are working with Capstone to demonstrate Class 7 and Class 8 microturbine range extended series hybrid trucks.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	Both vehicles are concept trucks intended to quantify the performance, efficiency, and economic benefits of a microturbine-based series hybrid solution.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P115_S2	Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P115_S3	In the meantime, Capstone has other hybrid vehicle customers that will benefit from continued development of this technology.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	The C65 Liquid Fuel microturbine demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P116_S1	These requirements are met using test procedures which evaluate emissions performance through start/stop and load transient cycles.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P116_S2	Capstone is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no aftertreatment.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P117_S1	The C30 Liquid Fuel microturbine met these requirements in March 2009.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P117_S2	In August 2011, we announced configurations of the C30 and C65 compressed natural gas ("CNG") fueled microturbines that meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On-Road Heavy Duty Diesel Engines for Urban Bus.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P117_S3	Test emissions from both the C30 and C65 Natural Gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P117_S4	We believe that future products will require the implementation of On Board Diagnostic controls to gain certification through the CARB.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	Capstone is working with the Department of Energy ("DOE") on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery and advanced AFA (Alumina Forming Austenitic) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
1009759_14_ITEM1_P118_S1	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat-resistant steel alloys used in Capstone microturbines at a significantly reduced cost.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	We are currently focusing efforts on the development of the C370 Dual Spool High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery system.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	In March 2013, Capstone successfully completed proof-of-concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development to increase power and electrical efficiency.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P119_S3	This accomplishment allowed Capstone to successfully achieve Phase Gate 2 requirements of the DOE contract and proceed with high pressure spool development.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P119_S4	Capstone also increased the power capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	program, which has now begun, is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits users through lower operating costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P120_S1	We expect to commercialize these products into the C200/C1000 product family upon successful project completion and acceptable technical readiness level.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 105 U.S. and 37 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_14_ITEM1_P121_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2014 and 2027.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is an important component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long-term competitive advantage.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	As of March 31, 2014, we had 225 employees.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.

1009759_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The following factors should be considered in addition to the other information contained herein in evaluating Capstone and its business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Annual Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as may be required by law.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ("Wells Fargo"), that provide us with a credit facility up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	At March 31, 2014, we had $13.2 million outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, we have pledged our accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral under the Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the Agreements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As of March 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with the annual net income financial covenant contained in the Agreements, as amended.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	On April 25, 2014, we received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we had not obtained the default waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The Agreement also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Agreements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue as a going concern on a longer term basis.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer term basis.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain a credit facility acceptable to the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Impairment charges on our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	consumer reluctance to try a new product; regulatory requirements; the cost competitiveness of our microturbines; costs associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines; maintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines; the future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines; economic downturns and reduction in capital spending; consumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality; the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products; and decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries or adversely impact the performance of our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S9	We also outsource certain of our components internationally and expect to increase international outsourcing of components.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P26_S10	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the continued recession in economic activity.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors; product quality and performance; operating efficiency; product price; availability, price and compatibility of fuel; development of new products and features; and emissions levels.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and global economic or political instability.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Two of our top distributors are located in Russia and Belgium, and therefore we are particularly susceptible to risks associated with doing business in these two countries.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We derived approximately 17% and 11% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Recently, the U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting business with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government may be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, we are currently evaluating the impact of the executive orders on our relationships with vendors.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and the Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting which existed as of March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we fail to properly remediate this or any future weaknesses or fail to maintain effective internal controls, there will be an adverse impact on our operations or the market price of our common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As of March 31, 2014, a material weakness was detected which related to our risk assessment process.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement fully our plan and controls to address this material weakness or that the plan and controls, if implemented, will be successful in remediating this material weakness.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, we may in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S4	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenues from these relationships.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S4	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $28.0 million and $17.9 million as of March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of Fiscal 2014 was 70 days, compared with 46 days at the end of Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We recorded bad debt expense of $0.2 million and $0.3 million during Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	E-Finity, BPC and Horizon accounted for approximately 19%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of our revenue for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Additionally, BPC and E-Finity accounted for 26% and 16%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The loss of E-Finity, Horizon, BPC or any other significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P65_S8	Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P68_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P68_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P83_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P83_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Potential litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We may face litigation relating to labor matters or other matters.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased cost of doing business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P87_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by risks related to cyber security threats.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P89_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, the services we provide to customers, the competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation or our stock price.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P91_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	At March 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $606.2 million and $226.9 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P95_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P101_S2	On December 21, 2012, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P101_S3	We subsequently regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P101_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	future equity financings; the failure to produce our products on a timely basis in accordance with customer expectations; the inability to obtain necessary components on time and at a reasonable cost; litigation or disputes with customers or business partners; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales or purchases of our common stock; the trading volume of our common stock; developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and decreases in oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P106_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right has been issued for each share of our common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Until the occurrence of certain prescribed events, the rights are not exercisable and are transferable along with, and only with, each share of our common stock and are evidenced by the common stock certificates.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P111_S2	One preferred stock purchase right will also be issued with each share of our common stock we issue in the future until the rights plan expires or is terminated or we redeem or exchange the rights for other property in accordance with the terms of the rights plan or at such time, if any, as the rights separate from each share of our common stock and become exercisable.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, dividends payable in cash in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends or other distributions, including non-cash dividends (payable in kind), declared on our common stock other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The rights plan prohibits the issuance of additional rights after the rights separate from our common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The rights plan is intended to protect our stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us.
1009759_14_ITEM1A_P113_S2	However, the existence of the rights plan may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of us that is not supported by our board of directors.
1009759_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our lease for those premises expires in July 2014, and we have two five-year options to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1009759_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that would have a material effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "CPST".
1009759_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the low and high sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 6, 2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $1.55 per share.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 6, 2014, there were 588 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant, including approval from Wells Fargo.
1009759_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data shown below have been derived from the audited financial statements of Capstone.
1009759_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Annual Report.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	During Fiscal 2014, we decreased our net loss by 28% to $16.3 million and our net loss per share by 29% to $0.05 compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We continue to remain focused on improving our gross margin.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our gross margin was 16% for Fiscal 2014, which represents an increase of 500 basis points from our gross margin of 11% for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	Management believes that our ongoing efforts in manufacturing cost reduction, royalty rate reductions and product robustness were the primary reasons for our gross margin and net loss improvement during Fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	Fiscal 2014 was characterized by strong new order flow and higher sales volume for our microturbine products led by the natural resources vertical market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P1_S6	In addition, the European market showed signs of improvement with an increase in revenue of 59%, primarily from Russia, compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Capstone products continue to gain interest in all five of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power/power security and mobile products).
1009759_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The renewable energy market applications are fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, biogas such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our C1000 Series microturbine continues to drive our near-term business success in the oil and gas and other natural resource market, which is our fastest growing market worldwide.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have seen a particularly strong increase in critical power supply solution orders this year as customers want solutions that can handle both primary and backup power.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Capstone's mobile products market, which utilizes microturbines for the marine and electric vehicle industry, is gaining interest as liquid natural gas becomes more readily available as a transportation fuel and as emission regulations continue to be tightened on the diesel engine industry.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near-term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, management closely manages operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The key drivers to Capstone's success are continued increase in C200 microturbine engine production rates, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	To support our opportunities to grow in our targeted markets, we continue to enhance the reliability and performance of our products by regularly developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	1) Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply and mobile products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we booked orders for 135.3 megawatts and shipped 109.9 megawatts of products, which combined with our backlog at March 31, 2013, resulted in 188.2 megawatts in backlog at the end of the fiscal year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our product shipments in Fiscal 2014 were: 60% for use in natural resources applications, 25% for use in energy efficiency applications, 6% for use in renewable energy applications and 9% for use in other applications (including critical power supply and mobile products).
1009759_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Energy efficiency applications use both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Capstone's microturbines can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding area.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Capstone's microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no access to an electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbines for a reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users, such as high technology and information systems companies, require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Management believes that Capstone's critical power supply offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric mobile applications, including transit buses and trucks.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship auxiliaries.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	2) Sales and Distribution Channel We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	We have a total of 89 distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	In North America, we currently have 29 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Internationally, outside of North America, we currently have 60 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	We continue to refine the distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	3) Service Service is provided primarily by our global distribution network.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	Together with our global distribution network we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive FPP.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S7	Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S8	Capstone provides factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S9	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S10	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2014 was $47.2 million which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2028.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S11	Service revenue in Fiscal 2014 was approximately 7% of total revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S12	4) Product Robustness We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S13	An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance cost to our customers.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S14	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S15	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, TA100, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S16	Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S17	We are currently focusing efforts on enhancing our products to improve reliability, reduce direct material costs, and be compliant with the new stringent European low and medium voltage grid inter-connect requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S18	We are also developing a more efficient microturbine CHP system with the DOE.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S19	The first phase of the development program has successfully achieved 270 kW with a prototype C250 engine.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P18_S20	Capstone plans to continue development of the engine as well as power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	6) Cost and Core Competencies We believe that the core competencies of Capstone products are air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our core intellectual property is contained within our air-bearing technology.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone's promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we ship approximately 200 units in a quarter, depending on an assumed product mix.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1009759_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The estimated fair value of the assets are determined using the best information available.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2014 and determined that no impairment was necessary.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ("FIFO") basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write-downs of inventories.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long-term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S5	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S6	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P34_S7	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed-upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically non-interest bearing.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days past payment terms.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is "more likely than not" that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the amount of net deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The use of Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The term "forfeitures" is distinct from "cancellations" or "expirations" and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	We re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	Ultimately, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Determining the warrant liability to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of the warrants.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	We calculate the fair values using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the contractual life of the warrants, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the warrant contractual life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2014 increased $5.5 million, or 4%, to $133.1 million from $127.6 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 included increases in revenue of $15.2 million from the European market, $6.1 million from the African market and $2.3 million from the Asian market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase in the European market was primarily related to increased sales into the Russian natural resources vertical market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	The increase in the African market was primarily the result of further market adoption of our products in this market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	The increases in the Asian market was primarily because of an increase in average selling prices of microturbine units shipped in Asia during Fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $16.4 million from the North American market, $1.5 million from the South American market and $0.2 million from the Australian market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P51_S6	The decreases in the North American, South American markets and Australian markets were primarily the result of a shift in certain customers' project timelines compared to the same period last year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Megawatts shipped and microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased as a result of higher sales volume for our C65 microturbine and a change in product mix of the C1000 Series systems, offset by lower sales volume for our C30, TA100 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	For Fiscal 2014, revenue from microturbine products increased $6.1 million, or 6%, to $108.8 million from $102.7 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Microturbine megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased 6.7 megawatts to 109.9 megawatts from 103.2 megawatts for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	Microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased 43 units to 671 units from 628 units for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	Average revenue per unit decreased for Fiscal 2014 to approximately $162,000 compared to approximately $163,000 per unit for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P52_S5	The decrease in average revenue per unit was primarily the result of a change in mix of C1000 Series systems and more C65 microturbines shipped during Fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	For Fiscal 2014, revenue from our accessories, parts and service decreased $0.6 million, or 2%, to $24.3 million from $24.9 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The decrease in revenue resulted primarily from lower sales of microturbine service work, partially offset by higher FPP contract enrollment, sales of microturbine parts and sales of accessories.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ("E-Finity), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 17%, 11% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 12%, 27% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The gross margin was $21.7 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2014 compared to a gross margin of $14.4 million, or 11% of revenue, for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The increase of $7.3 million in gross margin was the result of a $4.4 million improvement realized from overall higher revenue as a result of higher sales volume of our microturbine products as discussed above, lower direct material costs primarily related to the C1000 Series, decreases in our royalty expense of $1.5 million, warranty expense of $1.2 million and production and service center labor and overhead expenses of $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Management continues to implement initiatives to address warranty expense and to further reduce direct material costs as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Royalty expense decreased $1.5 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 as a result of a reduction in the predetermined fixed rate royalty offset by higher volume of covered microturbine systems.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	We pay a predetermined fixed rate royalty for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $1.2 million reflects a decrease in reliability repair programs, offset by an increase in the per unit standard warranty provision as a result of sales mix and higher volume of units under warranty during Fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Management expects per unit warranty rates for C200 and C1000 Series systems to decline as reliability repair programs are completed and these products mature.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased approximately $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 primarily as the result of a decrease in service center travel expense of approximately $0.4 million, offset by an increase in facilities expense of approximately $0.2 million.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Research and Development Expenses R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	We had R D expenses of approximately $9.0 million for each of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	During Fiscal 2014 supplies expense decreased approximately $0.3 million, offset by a decrease in cost sharing benefits of approximately $0.3 million.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	There were approximately $1.4 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2014 and $1.7 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2015 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2014 as we continue new product development, product robustness and direct material cost reduction initiatives.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	A expenses for Fiscal 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 2%, to $28.0 million from $27.4 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The net increase in SG A expenses was comprised of increases of approximately $0.7 million in salaries expense, $0.2 million in facilities expense $0.2 million in consulting expense and $0.2 million in supplies expense, offset by a decrease of approximately $0.7 million in marketing expense.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	Management expects SG A expenses in Fiscal 2015 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2014 as we focus on continuous improvement in customer service levels and advance general and administrative key initiatives.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	The reversal of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $10,000 for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	This reversal of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	The change in fair value of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $0.8 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	This change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of warrant exercises and revaluing the warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model which is based primarily upon the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	This revaluation of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $0.5 million, or 71%, to $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 from $0.7 million during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Income tax expense incurred was primarily related to foreign taxes of $0.2 million.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	The effective income tax rate of 1.4% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	At March 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $606.2 million and $226.9 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $236.2 million at March 31, 2014 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P67_S5	Similarly, at March 31, 2013, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2013 increased $18.2 million, or 17%, to $127.6 million from $109.4 million for Fiscal 2012.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	The increase in the North American market was primarily related to increased revenue in the U.S. shale plays market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	The increases in the Australian, Asian and South American markets were primarily the result of microturbine product sales to certain distributors that did not occur during the same period last year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $21.3 million from the European market and $0.9 million from the African market.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	We expect revenue from the European market will continue to be soft as a result of general economic conditions.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The decrease in the African market was primarily the result of non-recurring microturbine product sales in Fiscal 2012 to certain distributors that did not occur in Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	For Fiscal 2013, revenue from microturbine products increased $12.8 million, or 14%, to $102.7 million from $89.9 million for Fiscal 2012.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	Megawatts shipped and revenue per unit during Fiscal 2013 increased as a result of higher sales volume for our C30, TA100 and C200 systems and a change in product mix of the C1000 Series systems, offset by lower sales volume for our C65 microturbines.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	For Fiscal 2013, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $5.4 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million from $19.5 million for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in revenue resulted primarily from higher sales of microturbine parts and service work.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon") accounted for 27% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The gross margin was $14.4 million, or 11% of revenue, for Fiscal 2013 compared to a gross margin of $5.4 million, or 5% of revenue, for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	The increase in gross margin was primarily related to a $10.6 million improvement resulting from higher volume of C200 and C1000 Series product shipments, microturbine parts and service revenue, and lower direct material costs during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	The $10.6 million improvement and the lower production and service center labor and expenses of $0.4 million were offset by an increase in royalty expense of $1.1 million and warranty expense of $0.9 million.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased $0.4 million during Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 primarily as the result of a decrease in freight expense.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Royalty expense increased $1.1 million during Fiscal 2013 compared to Fiscal 2012 as a result of higher sales of our C200 and C1000 Series systems.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	We pay a royalty of a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The increase in warranty expense of $0.9 million reflects an increase in the standard warranty provision as a result of an increase in warranty claims related primarily to certain C200 and C1000 Series systems, an increase in reliability repair programs and higher volume of C200 and C1000 Series units under warranty during Fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Research and Development Expenses R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	The overall increase in R D expenses of $0.8 million resulted from increased supplies expense of $0.8 million, salaries expense of $0.7 million and consulting expense of $0.2 million, offset by increased cost-sharing benefits of $0.9 million.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	There were approximately $1.7 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2013 and $0.8 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	A expenses for Fiscal 2013 decreased $1.5 million, or 5%, to $27.4 million from $28.9 million for Fiscal 2012.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The net decrease in SG A expenses was comprised of a decrease of $2.0 million in bad debt expense and $0.9 million in professional services expense, which includes accounting and legal expenses and facilities expense of $0.7 million, offset by an increase of salaries and related expenses of $1.4 million, business travel expense of $0.4 million and marketing expense of $0.3 million.

1009759_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	The offering closed on May 6, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months; however, if our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	We could seek to raise funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P112_S3	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P112_S4	In addition, the equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	the market acceptance of our products and services; our business, product and capital expenditure plans; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; our competitors' response to our products and services; our relationships with customers, distributors, dealers and project resellers; and our customers' ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $28.0 million and $17.9 million as of March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding ("DSO") increased by 24 days to 70 days as of March 31, 2014 compared to 46 days as of March 31, 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	The change in DSO was largely the result of timing of cash receipts on the increased revenue.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S3	We recorded bad debt expense of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $2.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S4	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S5	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S6	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P115_S7	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	At March 31, 2014, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	As of March 31, 2014, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $32.2 million through Fiscal 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	As of March 31, 2014, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable under the Credit Facility is $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	One of the Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 30, 2014 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09").
1009759_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	We are evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements.
1009759_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we may enter into transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to changes in the interest rates results primarily from our Credit Facility borrowings.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2014, we had $13.2 million of outstanding indebtedness subject to interest rate fluctuations.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Based on these borrowings as of March 31, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the then current LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $0.1 million on an annual basis.
1009759_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from period to period and therefore could result in additional interest.
1009759_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Form 10-K beginning at page F-1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2014, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During this evaluation, management identified deficiencies primarily related to the inadequate design of certain control activities.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	None of the design deficiencies caused material errors to the financial statements, but the aggregation of these deficiencies presented a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the financial statements could have occurred.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's CEO and CFO and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management identified deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting related primarily to weaknesses in management's risk assessment process that led to the inadequate design of certain control activities in the areas of Factory Protection Plan ("FPP") Revenue, Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold related to Inventory.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	None of the design deficiencies caused material errors to the financial statements, but the combination of these deficiencies presents a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the financial statements could have occurred.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P4_S3	As such, management concluded that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed at March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	The report of KPMG LLP follows.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended March 31, 2014 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Management is committed to improving the Company's internal control processes.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	We are currently taking steps to enhance our risk assessment process and the design of control activities around FPP Revenue, Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold as it relates to Inventory and remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Management believes that these steps should remediate the material weakness and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P9_S3	As we continue to evaluate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, additional measures to remediate the material weakness or modifications to certain of the remediation procedures may be necessary.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We have audited Capstone Turbine Corporation's (Company's) internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Capstone Turbine Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P11_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P11_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P12_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P12_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P14_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P14_S1	A material weakness related to the Company's risk assessment process has been identified and included in management's assessment.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P14_S2	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and the consolidated balance sheets of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P14_S3	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated June 12, 2014, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P15_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Capstone Turbine Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_14_ITEM9A_P16_S0	We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statements referring to corrective actions taken after March 31, 2014, relative to the aforementioned material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	If the expected future cash flows from the use of such assets (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, the Company may be required to record a write-down, which is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2014 and determined that no impairment was necessary.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Service performed by the Company has consisted primarily of time and materials based contracts.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	The time and materials contracts are usually related to out-of-warranty units.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company also provides maintenance service contracts to customers of its existing installed base.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	The maintenance service contracts are agreements to perform certain services to maintain a product for a specified period of time.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P43_S5	Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company's judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Contingencies The Company records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Risk Concentrations Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	At March 31, 2014, the majority of our cash balances were held at financial institutions located in California.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Significant estimates include accounting for accounts receivable allowances, stock-based compensation, inventory write-downs, valuation of long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite lives, product warranties, income taxes and other contingencies.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	Diluted loss per share is also computed without consideration to potentially dilutive instruments because the Company incurred losses which would make such instruments antidilutive.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Outstanding stock options at March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 12.9 million, 11.8 million and 10.0 million, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	Outstanding restricted stock units at March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 2.1 million, 1.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	number of warrants excluded from diluted net loss per common share computations was approximately 26.5 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Options or stock awards are recorded at their estimated fair value at the measurement date.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company recognizes compensation cost for options and stock awards that have a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	On September 18, 2012, the Company entered into an Investor Agreement with one of the investors in the 2012 registered direct offering pursuant to which the investor agreed to (i) waive the condition precedent to the Company's exercise of the Put Option requiring the arithmetic average of the average daily trading volumes during the measurement period set forth in the subscription agreement between the Company and the investor and on the exercise date be not less than 1.75 million shares and (ii) amend the subscription agreement to provide that the purchase price of the additional shares during the first exercise period would be discounted pursuant to a formula that resulted in a purchase price for the first exercise period of $0.94 per share.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	Additionally, pursuant to the Investor Agreement, the Company agreed to amend the exercise price of the 2012 Warrants originally issued to the Investor to $1.26.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P112_S2	The exercise of the first Put Option resulted in net proceeds of $4.2 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P112_S3	The 2012 Warrants still outstanding as of March 31, 2013 provided for the purchase of 22.6 million shares at a weighted average exercise price of $1.41 per share.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	On February 21, 2013, the Company entered into a letter agreement (each a "Letter Agreement" and, collectively, the "Letter Agreements") with each of the investors in the March 5, 2012 registered direct offering.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, the parties evidenced their mutual agreement that the Company would not exercise any portion of the second Put Option.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company chose not to exercise the second of the two Put Options because of its improved cash position and its desire to avoid stockholder dilution.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P113_S3	On October 31, 2013, an unsolicited exercise of 2012 Warrants to purchase 4.7 million shares resulted in proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P113_S4	Effective October 31, 2013, all remaining outstanding 2012 Warrants expired.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Effective January 9, 2012, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with two holders of warrants issued by the Company on January 24, 2007 (the "2007 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for fees in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.3 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	The net proceeds to the Company in connection with the exercise of these 2007 Warrants was approximately $1.6 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Effective November 21, 2011, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with (i) two holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 17, 2009 (the "September 2009 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 5.8 million shares of the Company's common stock, (ii) four holders of warrants issued by the Company on September 17, 2008 (the "2008 Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock and (iii) six holders of 2007 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	Pursuant to the warrant exercise agreements, the September 2009 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the September 2009 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.34 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $5.4 million, the 2008 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the 2008 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.60 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $2.2 million and the 2007 Warrant holders agreed to exercise the 2007 Warrants described above at the existing exercise price of $1.17 in exchange for a fee of an aggregate amount of approximately $1.8 million.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The following table outlines the warrant activity:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_14_ITEM15_P117_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2014 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. Treasury Funds at March 31, 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2013 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	As the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P127_S2	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company adopted the amended provisions of ASC 815 on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in ASC 815.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	Warrants issued by the Company in prior periods with certain antidilution provisions for the holder are no longer considered indexed to the Company's own stock, and therefore no longer qualify for the scope exception and must be accounted for as derivatives.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P128_S2	These warrants were reclassified as liabilities under the caption "Warrant liability" and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P128_S3	The Company will continue to adjust the warrant liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, at which time the liability will be reclassified to stockholders' equity, or expiration of the warrants.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	The fair value of the Company's warrant liability (see Note 9 Stockholders' Equity Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock) recorded in the Company's financial statements is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method and the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market, volatility and expected life, a Level 3 measurement.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Volatility is based on the actual market activity of the Company's stock.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants' expected life.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	From time to time, the Company sells common stock warrants that are derivative instruments.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	As discussed above, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on contracts in an entity's own equity that requires the common stock warrants to be classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value at each reporting date recognized in the statement of operations.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liability which is measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
1009759_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate which amount was increased to an amount up to $20.0 million pursuant to the twelfth amendment described below (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	In addition, Wells Fargo has provided the Company with a non-revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in the Company's business pursuant to the amendment described below.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P134_S2	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	One of the Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 30, 2014 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit the Company's ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company's capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, (f) change the Company's accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Agreements also define an event of default to include a material adverse effect on the Company's business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P137_S1	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P138_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P138_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2013.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S1	On January 31, 2014, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S2	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's annual net income for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S3	On April 25, 2014, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S4	On June 9, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to the Agreements with Wells Fargo to increase the line of credit to an amount up to $20.0 million from $15.0 million and extend the maturity date of one of the lines of credit through September 30, 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S5	Additionally, this amendment made certain changes to decrease the required minimum cash balance relative to the outstanding line of credit advances and set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P139_S6	The amendment also added a $0.5 million non-revolving capital expense line of credit.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, the Company would not have been able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P140_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P140_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P140_S3	Based on the Company's current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P140_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, the Company would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the sum of daily three month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), which interest rate shall change whenever daily three month LIBOR changes, plus applicable margin.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	Based on the revolving nature of the Company's borrowings and payments, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P142_S2	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P142_S3	The Company's borrowing rate at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 was 4.0% and 5.4%, respectively.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	These fees were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense through September 2014.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	The Company is also required to pay an annual unused line fee of one-quarter of one percent of the daily average of the maximum line amount and 1.5% interest with respect to each letter of credit issued by Wells Fargo.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P143_S2	These amounts, if any, are also recorded as interest expense by the Company.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P143_S3	As of March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, $13.2 million and $13.5 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $32.2 million through Fiscal 2017.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not scheduled; therefore amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable upon the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	The Company leases offices and manufacturing facilities under various non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P145_S2	The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and renewal options for five-year periods.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P145_S3	Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P145_S4	The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	In September 2010, the Company was awarded a grant from the DOE for the research, development and testing of a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P150_S1	Part of the improved efficiency will come from an improved microturbine design, with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and power output of 370 kW. The project is estimated to cost approximately $17.4 million.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P150_S2	The DOE will contribute $5.0 million toward the project, and the Company will incur approximately $12.4 million in research and development expense.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P156_S1	The Development Agreement engaged UTCP to fund and support the Company's continued development and commercialization of the Company's 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbine.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P156_S3	In return, the Company agreed to pay to UTCP an ongoing royalty of 10% of the sales price of the C200 sold to customers other than UTCP until the aggregate of UTCP's cash and in-kind services investment had been recovered and, thereafter, the royalty would be reduced to 5% of the sales price.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P156_S4	In August 2009, the Development Agreement was assigned by UTCP to Carrier Corporation ("Carrier").
1009759_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	On January 14, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Development Agreement with Carrier that amended the royalty payment from a certain percentage of the sales prices to a predetermined fixed rate for each microturbine system covered by the amendment.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P157_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ( Capstone ) strives to be the world leader in the application of microturbine solutions for distributed generation power.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S1	In achieving this goal, we must remain committed to the highest standards of ethical behavior and legal compliance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S2	We firmly believe that operating with a strong sense of integrity is critical to maintaining trust and credibility with all of our stakeholders, including our customers, stockholders and employees.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S3	This Code of Business Conduct (the Code ) provides guidance to all Capstone directors and employees and assists us in carrying out our daily activities within appropriate ethical and legal standards.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S4	This Code also summarizes our expectations of accountability and the responsibility of all Capstone directors and employees.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S5	The general principles that guide our conduct go beyond mere compliance with laws and regulations.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P174_S6	They are the foundation to the kind of company we want to be.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	We will uphold the highest professional standards in all global business operations.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P175_S1	Likewise, the ethics of our suppliers, service providers and business partners is of utmost importance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P175_S2	We expect those with whom we do business to have, and follow, a similar code of ethical conduct.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	While we are all obligated to follow this Code and are responsible and accountable for our own conduct, Capstone expects our leaders to set the example - to be in every respect a model.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S1	They must ensure that those who report to them have sufficient information to comply with law, regulation, and policy, as well as the resources to resolve ethical dilemmas.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S2	They must foster and maintain a culture within Capstone that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S3	This culture must encourage everyone in the organization to raise concerns when they arise.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S4	We must never sacrifice ethical behavior and legal compliance in the pursuit of business objectives.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S5	Everyone is responsible and accountable for promptly reporting any potential violations of this Code or any law or regulation.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P176_S6	We must do more than follow the letter of the law we must do the right thing.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	Capstone employees who have questions regarding business conduct or possible violations and/or want to report a potential violation should contact the Corporate Ethics Manager who has direct access to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, as needed.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P177_S1	All inquiries and/or reporting violations are confidential and may be made anonymously.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P177_S2	You may contact the Corporate Ethics Manager via e-mail, mail, or telephone:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	When contacting the Corporate Ethics Manager is inappropriate or undesirable, you may contact Capstone s primary outside counsel:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	Members of the Board of Directors may contact the Chair of the Audit Committee directly.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	This Code supplements, and must be read together with, the policies and procedures contained in Capstone s Employee Handbook, as amended from time-to-time.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	Directors and employees are expected to make or participate in business decisions and actions in the course of their employment with Capstone based solely on the best interests of the company as a whole, free of conflicts of interest.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	A conflict of interest may occur if your outside activities or personal interests influence or appear to influence your ability to make objective decisions in the course of your job responsibilities.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S2	A conflict of interest may also exist if the demands of any outside activities hinder or distract you from the performance of your job or cause you to use Capstone s resources for purposes other than Capstone s.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S3	It is your obligation to ensure that your interests remain free of conflicts in the performance of your responsibilities at Capstone.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S4	It is impossible to identify all potential conflicts of interests, but they may include investments that may create a conflict, the outside development of technology or intellectual property within Capstone s industry, outside directorships or serving on technical advisory boards and the receipt or giving of any gift.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S5	Any potential conflict of interest must be reported as soon as it is recognized.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S6	No employee shall accept a position as a director, officer, partner or employee with any other non-Capstone business, without the consent of the Corporate Ethics Manager.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P180_S7	If you have any question as to whether any action may create a conflict of interest, you must first discuss the matter with our Corporate Ethics Manager.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	Capstone may receive or evaluate appropriate complimentary products or services.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P181_S1	Capstone may also make a gift of equipment to a company or organization, provided that the gift is openly given, with full knowledge by the company or organization, and is consistent with applicable law.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P181_S2	Any gifts received should be turned over to the Corporate Ethics Manager for appropriate disposition.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P181_S3	In all cases, the exchange of gifts will be conducted so there is no appearance of impropriety.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	Gifts may only be given in accordance with applicable laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ).
1009759_14_ITEM15_P182_S1	No gifts given or received may exceed $50 in value.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	Directors and employees of Capstone stand in a fiduciary relationship to Capstone and must advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P183_S1	It is a breach of this fiduciary duty for any such person to take advantage of a business opportunity for his or her own or another person s personal profit or benefit when the opportunity is within the corporate powers of Capstone and when the opportunity is of present or potential practical advantage to Capstone unless Capstone s Board of Directors knowingly elects not to avail itself of such opportunity and such person s participation is approved in advance by the Board of Directors.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P183_S2	If such a person appropriates such a Capstone corporate opportunity, Capstone may claim the benefit of the transaction or business and such person exposes himself or herself to liability in this regard.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	It is essential that every director and employee maintain confidentiality regarding information and trade secrets encountered at work.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P184_S1	Confidential information may not be released to or discussed with outside parties or with other employees who do not have a valid business reason to know the information.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P184_S2	Capstone s business and business relationships depend upon the confidential and proprietary nature of our information and of those with whom we do business - customers, vendors, suppliers, agents, and others.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P184_S3	The use of confidential and proprietary information (whether Capstone s or a third-party s) should be covered by a written confidential disclosure agreement or non-disclosure agreement.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	As a public company, Capstone s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission must be accurate and timely.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S1	Each Capstone employee is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of our documents and records, not only to comply with regulatory and legal requirements but also to ensure that records are available to defend our business practices and actions.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S2	No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S3	Depending on their position with Capstone, employees may be called upon to provide information to assure that the Company s public reports are complete, fair and understandable.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S4	Every employee, therefore, plays a role in accurate and ethical financial reporting, and is accountable for that responsibility.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P185_S5	Furthermore, the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Chief Executive Officer applies to all Senior Financial Officers, as defined therein, and is attached hereto as Exhibit A for reference purposes.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	Directors and employees must read and comply with Capstone s Insider Trading Policy, which details the trading restrictions imposed on any director, employee, or any person related to that director or employee.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P186_S1	Trading restrictions are imposed when a director or employee is in possession of material, non-public information relating to Capstone or any other company, including our customers or suppliers, if such material, non-public information was obtained in the course of the director s or employee s service to, or employment by, Capstone.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	As a U.S.-based company with international operations, Capstone is subject to laws and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad.
1009759_14_ITEM15_P187_S1	In addition to contradicting this Code, violation of governing laws and regulations subjects Capstone (and, in many cases, the individual who caused the violation) to significant risk in the form of fines, penalties and damaged reputation.

1009759_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	In connection with the annual report of Capstone Turbine Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), Darren R. Jamison, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Edward I. Reich, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each hereby certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ("Capstone" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide "on-site power generation" (also called "distributed generation") such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on-site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand-alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P2_S6	Together we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ("FPP").
1009759_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ("kW") to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our 30 kW ("C30") microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	The 65 kW ("C65") microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100-room hotel while also providing about one-third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our 200 kW ("C200") microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our 1000 kW ("C1000 Series") microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our microturbines combine patented air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S8	Because of our air-bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P4_S9	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our products produce exceptionally clean power.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our natural gas-fueled C65 and C200 microturbines were certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state-of-the-art central power plant.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our C65 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified in January 2008 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	November 2010 by CARB as meeting 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW ("TA100") microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS").
1009759_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after-market parts and services.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users' sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post-commissioning service.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our distributors perform as value-added resellers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	OEMs integrate Capstone's products into their own product solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer ("FTI") training and certification program.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Capstone provides factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers ("ASPs"), and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") refers to Capstone's fiscal years ending March 31 as its "Fiscal" years.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ("C60"), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone's C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO-sized container.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	During Fiscal 2015, we booked total orders of $84.5 million for 587 units, or 86.0 megawatts, compared to $131.5 million for 675 units, or 135.3 megawatts, during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We shipped 620 units with an aggregate of 91.4 megawatts, generating revenue of $90.4 million compared to 671 units with an aggregate of 109.9 megawatts, generating revenue of $108.8 million during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of March 31, 2015, we had 787 units, or 182.8 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 820 units, or 188.2 megawatts, at the same date last year.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The decrease in backlog was primarily the result of the downturn of the oil markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar making our products more expensive overseas and on-going geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next twelve months.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ("BTU") gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features:
1009759_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	advanced combustion technology; patented air-bearing technology; digital power electronics; and remote monitoring capability.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design geared towards manufacturability.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The air-bearing system allows the microturbine's single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum-based lubrication.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Air-bearings use a high-pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	For instance, our electronics control the microturbine's speed, temperature and fuel flow and communicate with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid-connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand-alone mode.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; on a stand-alone basis as a voltage source; multipacked to support larger loads as a "virtual single" unit; and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	We also offer C65 and C200 ICHP systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	These systems combine the standard C65 and C200 microturbine unit with a heat recovery module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual-mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone's proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	start the turbogenerator and manage its load; coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid; manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine; convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications; and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition, our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ("CRMS") allows end users to remotely operate and manage the microturbine.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require on-site monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to remotely and efficiently monitor their microturbine systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have expanded our microturbine's functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Capstone microturbine's multi-fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our C65 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine power systems are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its "Rule 21" grid interconnection standard.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site-by-site and utility-by-utility analysis.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre-cleared our microturbines for connection to New York's electric utility grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our C65 microturbine now meets the even more stringent CARB 2007 standard for natural gas.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand-alone operation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous-area oil and gas applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid-connect and stand-alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back-up generators as small as 2 kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Within the markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	Our microturbines' emissions of commonly found air pollutants ("criteria pollutants"), such as nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide ("CO") and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs"), are lower than those from the on-site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P44_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	A U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") report cited the total technical potential for the energy efficiency CHP at commercial, institutional and industrial sites in the United States to be over 130 gigawatts.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	The microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Capstone released for sale the C65 stand-alone digester product in the renewable energy market segment in 2007.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	This product is targeted at remote villages in third-world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 digester gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbine for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	In mid-2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	The addressable market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is significant.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	The shale gas market for microturbines is expected to grow substantially as demand for natural gas continues to rise and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P52_S4	Capstone has been invited to participate in numerous Natural Gas STAR workshops in the United States and foreign markets to demonstrate the emissions reductions our technology can provide.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	The C200 product is offered for sale configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	Capstone also offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology, health care and information systems facilities require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies ("UPS") to protect critical loads from momentary power disturbances along with backup diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	Capstone offers an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Capstone has developed the world's only microturbine powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT-grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and backup diesel generators.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	We offer two microturbine-powered UPS solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Capstone UPSource microturbine-powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Capstone's Hybrid UPS microturbine powered solution provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent backup.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	Our microturbine-powered UPS solutions are UL listed.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P57_S4	These integrated solutions are ideal for new construction or facility expansion and are typically installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency and reduce operating costs compared with traditional solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than ten seconds.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Capstone microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line-interactive continuous power solution.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ("HEV") applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric vehicles such as transit buses and trucks.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary engine.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our marine customers use both our liquid fueled and natural gas products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Liquefied natural gas ("LNG") is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary Capstone products: low emissions with no aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our world-wide distribution network is our most valuable intangible asset that we have proudly developed from the ground up.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	Each one of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner of Capstone marketing and selling the Capstone products and services on our behalf.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P66_S3	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment due anywhere from in advance of shipment to 90 days from shipment, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 18 months from shipment.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P66_S4	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power and mobile products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas and public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Recent energy reform in Mexico has opened new market opportunities by allowing competition and enabling power generation companies to sell directly to consumers instead of only to the state-owned Federal Electricity Commission.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	Capstone's strategy in Mexico is to leverage our distribution network in Mexico across various market verticals.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P69_S4	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our target markets in Asia and Australia are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the CHP, CCHP and the oil and gas market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P71_S3	China is expected to see growth in the oil and gas market, while biogas recovery is showing signs of growth in Southeast Asia.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our target market in the Middle East and Africa is primarily oil and gas.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Flare gas to power projects are a particularly attractive market opportunity given the volume of gas being flared and the acute and chronic need for stable power in the region.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Management has targeted distributors and customers involved in the capture and use of flare gas in the oil and gas market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	However, the geopolitical environment in this region is still volatile, which can impact our sales.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	During Fiscal 2015, the pace of economic recovery in Europe was slow and demand remained soft with a decrease in revenue of 30%, primarily from Russia, compared to Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Further, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could continue to negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	For more information, see "Risk Factors" beginning on Page 14 of this Form 10-K.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for Capstone based on a number of factors including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	While Capstone has distributors in nearly all South American countries, management is focused on what we consider to be the top markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 17%, 12% and 27% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 11%, 17% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ("E-Finity), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	Additionally, Optimal Group Australia Pty Ltd ("Optimal"), one of the Company's Australian distributors, accounted for 17% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P80_S4	BPC, Electro Mecanique Industries ("EMI"), one of the Company's distributors in the Middle East and Africa, and E-Finity accounted for 26%, 18% and 16%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from BPC.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC's recent payment history and because the impact of the steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	Also during the three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from EMI.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI's payment history.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P81_S4	The Company recorded bad debt expense of approximately $10.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well-established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	These technologies, which typically have a lower up-front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz Corporation, GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, Tecogen, Inc. and W rtsil Corporation, among others.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar power, wind power systems and fuel cells.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including FuelCell Energy Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, Plug Power Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P91_S3	However, over the medium-to-long term, fuel cell technology companies may introduce products that compete more directly with our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	Overall, we compete with end users' other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine's ability to:
1009759_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; operate on multiple fuel types; reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases); simplify operation; and control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P96_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Capstone continues to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone's low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	Kevin Mullin, Speaker Pro Tempore and Assembly member for California's 22 nd Assembly district, recently introduced A.B. 674 in the California legislature.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	This bill may stimulate the market in California for Capstone products by revising utility charges and standby rates that apply to distributed generation projects.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P99_S3	In the wake of numerous destructive storms, several state and local governments are putting greater value in resilient distributed generation resources, including CHP and microgrids, and even reassessing the traditional utility model.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P99_S4	However, utilities in other states have asked public utility commissioners to revisit incentive programs and exemptions from grid usage charges for distributed generation technologies, arguing that these policies shift costs to other rate payers.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	While we continue to receive development funding, committed amounts remaining are relatively low.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P101_S2	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P101_S3	There are certain recent federal funding solicitations that may support microturbine development.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P101_S4	We cannot provide any assurance that any proposal Capstone submits will be funded.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S1	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume and low cost production objectives.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S2	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S3	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S4	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S5	We have an on-going program to develop alternative back-up suppliers for sole source parts.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S6	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S7	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S8	We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S9	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S10	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P102_S11	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	We have a combined total of approximately 102,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	well as manufacture air-bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P104_S1	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P104_S2	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P104_S3	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P104_S4	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ("Solar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P105_S2	The cores are subject to a per-unit royalty fee.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P105_S3	As of March 31, 2015, cumulative royalties of $0.6 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	The Company is a party to a Development and License Agreement with Carrier Corporation ("Carrier") regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of the Company's 200 kilowatt ("C200") microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P106_S1	During the three months ended September 30, 2013, we reached our repayment threshold level and the fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% on future sale of each of our C200 microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P106_S2	As of March 31, 2015, cumulative royalties of $15.2 million have been paid under the terms of the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, R D expenses were $9.7 million, $9.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 8%, 7% and 7% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants and the Development Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P107_S2	Benefits from cost-sharing programs were $0.5 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	During Fiscal 2015 we made significant development in variants of the C1000 Series product line.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	A liquid fuel version of the C1000 Series was produced with the use of Capstone's lean premix combustion technology based on the development work done previously with the C200 liquid fuel system.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P109_S2	Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone's microturbine products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Digester gas C1000 was produced to run off the Palm Oil Milling Effluent (POME) biogas produced as a byproduct of the palm oil extraction process.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	Advancement realized in both of these products opens up new markets for Capstone and also allows for further development possibilities in the areas of liquid fuel and biogas.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	During Fiscal 2014 we achieved compliance with the German low voltage requirements, which have been adopted throughout much of Europe.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	During Fiscal 2015 we continued to make improvements to all our microturbine products to be compliant with other widely adopted European low and medium voltage grid inter-connect requirements for decentralized power generation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P111_S2	Compliance with other widely adopted European requirements for both low and medium voltage are planned to be completed during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P111_S3	This work will prepare us for the expected expansion of distributed generation grid inter-connect requirements within the US market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency; thereby reducing our customers' total cost of ownership.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	We are continuing to work on product improvements to our C30 and C65 microturbine products targeted at the hybrid electric bus and truck market.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	Because of Capstone's single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	Our current focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid-cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	Capstone is working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine-based series hybrid solution.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P115_S2	The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is currently being retrofitted with a refrigerated box body and should be ready for track testing at Kenworth facilities later in the year.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P115_S3	The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the San Joaquin Valley, California.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P115_S4	Capstone expects to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck's road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	A prototype or concept vehicle may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	Capstone also worked with Peterbilt Motors to develop a series hybrid drivetrain as part of a concept Class 8 tractor for Walmart.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	The Walmart Advanced Vehicle Experience ("WAVE") concept truck is the latest in Walmart's fleet efficiency program.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	The WAVE concept truck has advanced aerodynamics and is powered by a Capstone C30 range-extending microturbine in its hybrid powertrain.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P118_S2	This futuristic concept truck was unveiled at the Mid America Trucking Show in March, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P118_S3	Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P118_S4	As such, Capstone is working with both Peterbilt and Walmart as they continue to showcase the WAVE truck at various expos and hybrid vehicle shows around the country.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	Capstone liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines ("HDDE").
1009759_15_ITEM1_P119_S1	Capstone is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P120_S1	Capstone's compressed natural gas ("CNG") fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On-Road HDDE for Urban Bus.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P120_S2	Test emissions from our Natural Gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P120_S3	These microturbines are now certified by CARB and available for production in Fiscal 2016.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	Capstone is expanding into the marine sector through collaboration with vessel owners, shipyards, and its marine OEM partner, Microturbine Marine Energy.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	Capstone's marine products can be used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, "hotel power," CHP, or CCHP.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P121_S2	They are especially ideal for small- and mid-size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas (ECAs).
1009759_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	A notable case study is the Deen Shipping's Argonon, where LNG fuels two C30 microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P121_S4	Both units have been in operation since 2011 and have saved 25 tons of diesel equivalents per year, compared to conventional accommodation heating and chilling.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	for its marine products, which is expected in 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	Type Approval provides independent product verification that the product conforms to recognized industry quality standards, International Conventions and/or Marine Classification Society Rules, through a process of independent design review, sample testing and verification of production controls.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	Capstone continues to evolve our C65 Hybrid UPS product line.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S1	After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University's data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, Capstone's C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has recent installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, CA and Capstone's own Data Center in Chatsworth, CA.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S2	The product utilizes Capstone's inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer's critical load.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S3	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S4	Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S5	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone's multipack feature.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S6	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P124_S7	Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, the low emissions Capstone Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	Capstone is working with the Department of Energy ("DOE") on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery and advanced AFA (Alumina Forming Austenitic) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S1	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S2	We are currently focusing efforts on the development of the C370 Dual Spool High Efficiency Microturbine with integral heat recovery system.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S3	In March 2013, Capstone successfully completed proof-of-concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S4	This allowed Capstone to successfully achieve Phase Gate 2 requirements of the DOE contract and proceed with high pressure spool development.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S5	Capstone also demonstrated and increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P125_S6	The final phase of the program, which is expected to be completed during Fiscal 2016, will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits users through lower operating costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat-resistant steel alloys used in Capstone microturbines at a significantly reduced cost.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P127_S1	In Fiscal 2017, we expect to complete the second endurance test, after which we will be positioned to make a commercialization decision.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P128_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 103 U.S. and 34 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_15_ITEM1_P128_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2015 and 2027.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is an important component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long-term competitive advantage.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	As of March 31, 2015, we had 236 employees.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.

1009759_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The following factors should be considered in addition to the other information contained herein in evaluating Capstone and its business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Annual Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as may be required by law.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ("Wells Fargo"), that provide us with a credit facility up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	At March 31, 2015, we had $13.0 million outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, we have pledged our accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral under the Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements, we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the Agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Agreements in response to the default.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As of March 31, 2015, we were not in compliance with the annual net income financial covenant contained in the Agreements, as amended.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	On June 10, 2015, we received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we had not obtained the default waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The Agreement also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue as a going concern on a longer term basis.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer term basis.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain a credit facility acceptable to the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Impairment charges on our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	economic downturns and reduction in capital spending; consumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality; the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products; and decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries or adversely impact the performance of our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We also outsource certain of our components internationally.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors; product quality and performance; operating efficiency; product price; availability, price and compatibility of fuel; development of new products and features; and emissions levels.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We derived approximately 11% and 17% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Recently, the U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting certain oil and gas production related business activities with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies and requiring export licenses for certain of such activities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government could be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, we are currently evaluating the impact of the executive orders on our relationships with vendors.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of March 31, 2014 because a material weakness was detected which related to our risk assessment process.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Management determined that this material weakness was remediated during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Refer to Item 9A, "Controls and Procedures" for additional information.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We may in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S6	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenues from these relationships.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $13.1million and $28.0 million as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of Fiscal 2015 was 40 days, compared with 70 days at the end of Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We recorded bad debt expense of $10.1 million and $0.2 million during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Horizon and BPC accounted for approximately 17% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Additionally, Optimal accounted for 17% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The loss of Horizon, BPC or any other significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P66_S8	Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P69_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P69_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P84_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Potential litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We may face litigation relating to labor matters or other matters.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased cost of doing business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P88_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by risks related to cyber security threats.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P90_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, the services we provide to customers, the competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation or our stock price.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P92_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P96_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake-sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P99_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we continue to fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S2	On December 19, 2014, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S3	In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 17, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S4	In order to regain compliance, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, at which time Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department would provide written confirmation of our compliance.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S5	In the event we do not meet the minimum bid price requirement during the initial 180-day grace period, we may be eligible for an additional 180-day grace period under the Nasdaq listing rules if we meet the listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P101_S6	We may need to implement a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If we continue to fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; market sentiment toward alternative energy stocks in general or toward Capstone; changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; conditions or trends in our industry or the overall economy; loss of one or more of our significant customers; errors, omissions or failures by third parties in meeting commitments to us; changes in the market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies; the trading of options on our common stock; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; announcements of significant market events, such as power outages, regulatory changes or technology changes; changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our market; future equity financings; the failure to produce our products on a timely basis in accordance with customer expectations; the inability to obtain necessary components on time and at a reasonable cost; litigation or disputes with customers or business partners; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales or purchases of our common stock; the trading volume of our common stock; developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and decreases in oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right has been issued for each share of our common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Until the occurrence of certain prescribed events, the rights are not exercisable and are transferable along with, and only with, each share of our common stock and are evidenced by the common stock certificates.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P112_S2	One preferred stock purchase right will also be issued with each share of our common stock we issue in the future until the rights plan expires or is terminated or we redeem or exchange the rights for other property in accordance with the terms of the rights plan or at such time, if any, as the rights separate from each share of our common stock and become exercisable.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, dividends payable in cash in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends or other distributions, including non-cash dividends (payable in kind), declared on our common stock other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The rights plan prohibits the issuance of additional rights after the rights separate from our common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P114_S1	The rights plan is intended to protect our stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us.
1009759_15_ITEM1A_P114_S2	However, the existence of the rights plan may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of us that is not supported by our board of directors.
1009759_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our lease for those premises expires in September 2019, and we have one five-year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1009759_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that would have a material effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, financial position or results of operations should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "CPST".
1009759_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the low and high sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 8, 2015, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $0.55 per share.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 8, 2015, there were 560 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant.
1009759_15_ITEM5_P3_S3	Additionally, the consent of Wells Fargo would be necessary in order for the Company to declare and pay a dividend in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data shown below have been derived from the audited financial statements of Capstone.
1009759_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM6_P0_S2	The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) The Company recorded bad debt expense of approximately $10.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.3 million, $2.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Annual Report.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (combined heat and power ("CHP") and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	During Fiscal 2015 our net loss increased by 93% to $31.5 million and our net loss per share increased by 100% to $0.10 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The increase in the net loss was primarily the result of lower revenue and accounts receivable allowance for two customers during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Please see Results of Operations on page 34 for further discussion on the lower revenue and accounts receivable allowance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	We continue to remain focused on improving our gross margin.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Our gross margin was 16% for each of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	While our year over year revenue decreased 13%, our gross margin rate remained flat compared to Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S6	During Fiscal 2015 we benefitted from our ongoing efforts in manufacturing cost reductions that were entirely offset by lower volume and lower average selling prices for our microturbines compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P4_S7	Fiscal 2015 was characterized by lower revenue as our operational progress was eclipsed by challenging macroeconomic headwinds over the last year which included the dramatic downturn of the oil markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar making our products more expensive overseas and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East; all of these factors negatively impacted our business.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Capstone products continue to gain interest in all six of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, marine and transportation).
1009759_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The renewable energy market is fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our success in the oil and gas and other natural resources market, which continues to be a growing market worldwide is driven by our microturbines reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We have also seen increased interest in critical power supply solution applications as customers want solutions that can handle both primary and backup power.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Capstone's transportation market, which utilizes microturbines for electric vehicle industries, is gaining interest as liquid natural gas becomes more readily available as a transportation fuel and emission regulations continue to be tightened on the diesel engine industry.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near-term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, management closely manages operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	The key drivers to Capstone's success are revenue growth, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	To support our opportunities to grow in our targeted markets, we continue to enhance the reliability and performance of our products by regularly developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	1) Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, marine and transportation products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	During Fiscal 2015, we booked orders for 86.0 megawatts and shipped 91.4 megawatts of products, which combined with our backlog at March 31, 2014, resulted in 182.8 megawatts in backlog at the end of the fiscal year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our product shipments in Fiscal 2015 were: 49% for use in natural resources applications, 44% for use in energy efficiency applications and 7% for use in renewable energy applications.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Energy efficiency applications use both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 75% or more.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Capstone's microturbines can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this "free" renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding area.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Capstone's microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Typically these oil and gas or mining operations have no access to an electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone's microturbines for a reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users, such as high technology and information systems companies, require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Management believes that Capstone's critical power supply offerings are the world's only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source solutions that can offer clean, IT-grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ("HEV") applications.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric mobile applications, including transit buses and trucks.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship auxiliaries.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel's electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	2) Sales and Distribution Channels We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	A significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to distributors who resell our products to end users.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We have a total of 97 distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	In North America, we currently have 31 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	Outside of North America, we currently have 66 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	We continue to refine the distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	3) Service We provide service primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	Together with our global distribution network we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ("FPP").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S8	Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S9	Capstone provides factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S10	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S11	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 was $61.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2029.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P21_S12	Service revenue in Fiscal 2015 was approximately 9% of total revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance cost to our customers.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, TA100, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	We are currently focusing efforts on enhancing our products to improve reliability, reduce direct material costs, and be compliant with the new European grid interconnect requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	We are also developing a more efficient microturbine CHP system with the DOE.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S7	The first phase of the development program has successfully achieved 270 kW with a prototype C250 engine.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S8	Capstone plans to continue development of the engine as well as power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P22_S9	The second phase of the program is expected to incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program of which $3.9 million has been used through March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	6) Cost and Core Competencies We believe that the core competencies of Capstone products are air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our core intellectual property is contained within our air-bearing technology.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone's promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we ship approximately 200 units in a quarter, depending on an assumed product mix.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	including finite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The estimated fair value of the assets are determined using the best information available.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2015 and determined that no impairment was necessary.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ("FIFO") basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write-downs of inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long-term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning service.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed-upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically non-interest bearing.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days past payment terms.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is "more likely than not" that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the amount of net deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	The use of Black-Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company's actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company's best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Risk-free interest rate We used the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk-free interest rate.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The term "forfeitures" is distinct from "cancellations" or "expirations" and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	We re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Ultimately, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2015 decreased $17.6 million, or 13%, to $115.5 million from $133.1 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 included decreases in revenue of $12.3 million from the European market, $4.3 million from the African market, $3.9 million from the North American market and $1.5 million from the Asian market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease in the European market was primarily the result of the continuing geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar making our product more expensive overseas compared to Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The revenue decline during Fiscal 2015 in the North American market was primarily the result of a drop in the oil and gas market which has affected the timing of customer demand for our products compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	Revenue from the Asian and African markets decreased during Fiscal 2015 because of the impact of a decline in the oil and gas market and stronger U.S. dollar.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	These overall decreases in revenue were offset by increases in revenue of $3.6 million from the Australian market and $0.8 million from the South American market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	The increase in the Australian and South American markets was primarily the result of our continued efforts to improve distribution channels.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Megawatts shipped, microturbine units shipped and average revenue per unit decreased primarily as a result of lower sales volume and shift in product mix for our microturbines during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Revenue from microturbine products during Fiscal 2015 decreased $19.4 million, or 18%, to $89.4 million from $108.8 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Microturbine megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2015 decreased 18.5 megawatts to 91.4 megawatts from 109.9 megawatts for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	Microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2015 decreased 51 units to 620 units from 671 units shipped during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	Average revenue per unit shipped decreased for Fiscal 2015 to approximately $144,000 compared to approximately $162,000 per unit for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P54_S5	The decrease in average revenue per unit was primarily the result of a decrease in shipments of our C1000 Series systems partially offset by an increase in shipments of our C65 microturbines during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	For Fiscal 2015, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $1.8 million, or 7%, to $26.1 million from $24.3 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in revenue resulted primarily from higher FPP contract enrollment and sales of microturbine parts, partially offset by lower sales of microturbine service work.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ("Horizon"), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 17%, 12% and 27% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Sales to BPC Engineering ("BPC"), one of the Company's Russian distributors, accounted for 11%, 17% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ("E-Finity), one of the Company's domestic distributors, accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	The gross margin was $18.3 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2015 compared to a gross margin of $21.7 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The change in the gross margin during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 was driven by multiple factors including lower royalty expense of $1.2 million, lower production and service center labor and overhead expense of $1.0 million and lower warranty expense of $0.4 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	The positive impact of these factors was offset by the adverse impact of lower volume, lower average selling prices and a change in product mix for our microturbines of $5.0 million and higher inventory charges of $1.0 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	Management continues to implement initiatives to improve gross margin by further reducing manufacturing overhead fixed and direct material costs as we work to achieve profitability and improving product performance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Royalty expense decreased $1.2 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 as a result of a reduction in the predetermined fixed rate royalty.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	We pay a predetermined fixed rate royalty for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as the result of decreases in service center travel expense of approximately $0.3 million, facilities expense of $0.3 million, salaries expense of $0.2 million and supplies expense of $0.2 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $0.4 million reflects a decrease in the standard warranty provision as a result of sales volume and a decrease in reliability repair programs during Fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	Management expects warranty claim levels for C200 and C1000 Series systems to decline as reliability repair programs are completed and these products mature.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Inventory charges increased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of an allowance for slow-moving inventory related to our waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we shipped approximately $0.7 million of product to BPC.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Given the uncertainty as to the collectability of the sale, revenue recognition on this shipment was deferred.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, as we do not have title to the product or rights to receive the product back in the event we are not paid, such amounts were expensed through cost of goods sold for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Research and Development Expenses R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	R D expenses for Fiscal 2015 increased $0.7 million, or 8%, to $9.7 million from $9.0 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	During Fiscal 2015 cost sharing benefits decreased approximately $0.9 million offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in professional services expense.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P66_S4	There were approximately $0.5 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2015 and $1.4 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2016 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2015 as we continue product robustness and direct material cost reduction initiatives.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	A expenses for Fiscal 2015 increased $11.5 million, or 41%, to $39.5 million from $28.0 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The net increase in SG A expenses was comprised of increases of $9.9 million in bad debt expense, $0.9 million in salaries expense, $0.6 million in professional services expense, which includes legal expense, $0.4 million in marketing expense and $0.1 million in business travel expense, offset by a decreases of $0.2 million in facilities expense and $0.2 million in supplies expense.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	The increase in the bad debt expense was primarily the result of accounts receivable allowances recorded for BPC and Electro Mecanique Industries ("EMI"), one of the Company's distributors in the Middle East and Africa, during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from BPC.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S4	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC's recent payment history and because the impact of the steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S5	Also during three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to EMI.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S6	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI's payment history.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P68_S7	Excluding bad debt expense, management expects SG A expenses in Fiscal 2016 to be higher than in Fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of expanding our aftermarket services, which may require paying incentive-based compensation to certain key Capstone employees in the event that Capstone achieves its planned results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 29%, to $0.5 million during Fiscal 2015 from $0.7 million during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of March 31, 2015, we had total debt of $13.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability Effective September 23, 2013, warrants issued in connection with the September 23, 2008 registered direct placement to purchase 4.0 million shares expired, and the liability associated with the warrants was reversed.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	The reversal of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $10,000 for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	This reversal of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $0.1 million, or 50%, to $0.1 million during Fiscal 2015 from $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Income tax expense incurred was related to state and foreign taxes.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	The effective income tax rate of 0.4% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 37% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	At March 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $626 million and $202 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $246.8 million at March 31, 2015 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	Similarly, at March 31, 2014, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2014 increased $5.5 million, or 4%, to $133.1 million from $127.6 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 included increases in revenue of $15.2 million from the European market, $6.1 million from the African market and $2.3 million from the Asian market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	The increase in the European market was primarily related to increased sales into the Russian natural resources vertical market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	The increase in the African market was primarily the result of further market adoption of our products in this market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	The increase in the Asian market was primarily because of an increase in average selling prices of microturbine units shipped in Asia during Fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	This overall increase in revenue was offset by decreases in revenue of $16.4 million from the North American market, $1.5 million from the South American market and $0.2 million from the Australian market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	The decreases in the North American, South American and Australian markets were primarily the result of a shift in certain customers' project timelines compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Megawatts shipped and microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased as a result of higher sales volume for our C65 microturbine and a change in product mix of the C1000 Series systems, offset by lower sales volume for our C30, TA100 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	For Fiscal 2014, revenue from microturbine products increased $6.1 million, or 6%, to $108.8 million from $102.7 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Microturbine megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased 6.7 megawatts to 109.9 megawatts from 103.2 megawatts for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2014 increased 43 units to 671 units from 628 units for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	Average revenue per unit decreased for Fiscal 2014 to approximately $162,000 compared to approximately $163,000 per unit for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P74_S5	The decrease in average revenue per unit was primarily the result of a change in mix of C1000 Series systems and more C65 microturbines shipped during Fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	For Fiscal 2014, revenue from our accessories, parts and service decreased $0.6 million, or 2%, to $24.3 million from $24.9 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	The decrease in revenue resulted primarily from lower sales of microturbine service work, partially offset by higher FPP contract enrollment, sales of microturbine parts and sales of accessories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Sales to E-Finity accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Sales to BPC accounted for 17%, 11% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Sales to Horizon accounted for 12%, 27% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The gross margin was $21.7 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2014 compared to a gross margin of $14.4 million, or 11% of revenue, for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The increase of $7.3 million in gross margin was the result of a $4.4 million improvement realized from overall higher revenue as a result of higher sales volume of our microturbine products as discussed above, lower direct material costs primarily related to the C1000 Series, decreases in our royalty expense of $1.5 million, warranty expense of $1.2 million and production and service center labor and overhead expenses of $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Royalty expense decreased $1.5 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 as a result of a reduction in the predetermined fixed rate royalty offset by higher volume of covered microturbine systems.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	We pay a predetermined fixed rate royalty for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $1.2 million reflected a decrease in reliability repair programs, offset by an increase in the per unit standard warranty provision as a result of sales mix and higher volume of units under warranty during Fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased approximately $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013 primarily as the result of a decrease in service center travel expense of approximately $0.4 million, offset by an increase in facilities expense of approximately $0.2 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Research and Development Expenses R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	We had R D expenses of approximately $9.0 million for each of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	During Fiscal 2014 supplies expense decreased approximately $0.3 million, offset by a decrease in cost sharing benefits of approximately $0.3 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	There were approximately $1.4 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2014 and $1.7 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	A expenses for Fiscal 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 2%, to $28.0 million from $27.4 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The net increase in SG A expenses was comprised of increases of approximately $0.7 million in salaries expense, $0.2 million in facilities expense $0.2 million in consulting expense and $0.2 million in supplies expense, offset by a decrease of approximately $0.7 million in marketing expense.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense for each of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was approximately $0.7 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Interest expense is primarily from the average balances outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	As of March 31, 2014, we had total debt of $13.2 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability Effective September 23, 2013, warrants to purchase approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the September 23, 2008 registered direct placement expired, and the liability associated with the warrants was reversed.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The reversal of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $10,000 for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	This reversal of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	The change in fair value of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $0.8 million for Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S4	This change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of warrant exercises and revaluing the warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model which is based primarily upon the quoted price of the Company's common stock in an active market.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P88_S5	This revaluation of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $0.5 million, or 71%, to $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014 from $0.7 million during Fiscal 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Income tax expense incurred was primarily related to foreign taxes of $0.2 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	The effective income tax rate of 1.4% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	At March 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $606.2 million and $226.9 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $236.2 million at March 31, 2014 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	Similarly, at March 31, 2013, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	This information was prepared in accordance with GAAP, and, in the opinion of management, contains all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere herein.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our operating results for any prior quarters may not necessarily indicate the results for any future periods.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded an allowance of approximately $1.2 million for slow-moving inventory related to our waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	In addition, we shipped approximately $0.7 million of product to BPC during the three months ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	Given the uncertainty as to the collectability of the sale, the revenue for this shipment was not recognized.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	Both transactions were included in cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from BPC.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC's recent payment history and because the impact of the recent steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable balance from EMI.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI's payment history.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	Both transactions were included in SG A for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our plan.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	We expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to running our business and creating the strategic changes summarized herein.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Our planned capital expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2016 include approximately $2.0 million for plant and equipment costs related to manufacturing and operations.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	We have invested our cash in institutional funds that invest in high quality short-term money market instruments to provide liquidity for operations and for capital preservation.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our cash and cash equivalent balances increased $4.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The overall improvement in cash used during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the year ended March 31, 2014 was primarily the result of cash provided by financing activities.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	Operating Activities During the year ended March 31, 2015, we used $23.0 million in cash in our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $31.5 million and cash used for working capital of $11.9 million, offset by non-cash adjustments (primarily accounts receivable allowances, warranty provision, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and inventory provision) of $20.4 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2014, operating cash usage was $15.4 million, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $16.3 million and cash used for working capital of $9.7 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $10.6 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	(1) Represents accounts receivable allowances, warranty provision, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, inventory provision and change in fair value of warrant liability.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The increase in net cash used in operating activities during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 was primarily related to the increase in net loss, excluding non-cash operating activities, and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by cash provided from accounts receivable and change in inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The change of accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily the result of management's initiatives to reduce aged payables and the timing and level of inventory receipts compared to vendor payments.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	The change in accounts receivable was primarily the result of timing of cash receipts on lower revenue.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	The change in inventory was primarily because of higher finished goods as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	The increase in non-cash operating activities during Fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an accounts receivable allowance for BPC and EMI during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1.6 million and $1.2 million during the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 relates primarily to the acquisition of fixed assets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	Financing Activities During the year ended March 31, 2015, we generated approximately $29.0 million from financing activities compared to cash generated during the year ended March 31, 2014 of approximately $5.7 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2015 were primarily from the proceeds related to our underwritten public offering described below.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2014 were primarily the result of the exercise of warrants, described below which yielded $6.0 million in cash, offset by repayments under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	Net repayments under the Credit Facility were approximately $0.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to net borrowings of approximately $0.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Effective May 6, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which it sold 18.8 million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $1.70 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The shares were allocated to a single institutional investor.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the common stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $29.8 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	On October 31, 2013, an unsolicited exercise of warrants to purchase 4.7 million shares resulted in proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	Effective October 31, 2013, all remaining outstanding warrants expired.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Employee stock purchases, net of repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units, resulted in approximately $0.2 million of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2015, compared with $0.1 million of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo, which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	The line of credit can be increased to an amount up to $20.0 million upon the request of the Company pursuant to the amendment described below (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	In addition, Wells Fargo has provided the Company with a non-revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in the Company's business pursuant to the amendment described below.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	As of March 31, 2015 the Company had not requested that the maximum line amount be increased to an aggregate of $20.0 million pursuant to the Agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P105_S4	The amount actually available to us may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, we granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of our assets.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	One of the Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017, and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	As of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, $13.0 million and $13.2 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, our capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (f) change our accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.

1009759_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements we were not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	On September 16, 2014, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with Wells Fargo.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	The Letter Agreement extended the maturity date under the Company's Credit and Security Agreement (Ex-Im Subfacility) from September 30, 2014 to September 1, 2017.

1009759_15_ITEM7_P110_S3	As of September 30, 2014, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's annual net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P110_S4	On November 3, 2014, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance and entered into an amendment to amend the financial covenants regarding net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's annual net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	On June 10, 2015, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance, and the Company and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	As a condition of the amended Agreements, the Company has restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 10, 2015 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	Based on our current forecasts, management believes we will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P112_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, management would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Management has the ability to manage certain operating assets and liabilities, specifically the procurement of inventory and timing of payments of accounts payable, capital expenditures and certain operating expenses depending on the results of its operations to extend its cash and cash equivalents.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	In the event that our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	We could seek to raise funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors, or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S4	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S5	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P113_S6	In addition, the equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	the market acceptance of our products and services; our business, product and capital expenditure plans; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; our competitors' response to our products and services; our relationships with customers, distributors, dealers and project resellers; and our customers' ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $13.1 million and $28.0 million as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding ("DSO") decreased by 30 days to 40 days as of March 31, 2015 compared to 70 days as of March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	The change in DSO was largely the result of an accounts receivable allowance and timing of cash receipts on lower sales during the period.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded bad debt expense of approximately $7.1 million with respect to BPC.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	of their accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC's recent payment history and because the impact of the steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	Also during the three months ended September 30, 2014 we recorded bad debt expense of approximately $2.6 million with respect to EMI.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	We determined that the collectability of their accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI's payment history.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P118_S3	We recorded bad debt expense of $10.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P119_S3	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	At March 31, 2015, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	As of March 31, 2015, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $35.2 million through Fiscal 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P122_S2	As of March 31, 2015, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable under the Credit Facility is $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	One of the Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).
1009759_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	The ASU was issued as part of FASB's current plan to simplify overly complex standards.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this ASU.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	The update requires retrospective application to all prior period amounts presented.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P127_S3	This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P127_S4	We are currently evaluating the potential impacts the new standard will have on our reporting process.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	We are currently evaluating the potential impacts the new standard will have on our reporting process.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ("ASU 2014-12").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	We are evaluating the potential impacts of the new standard on our existing stock-based compensation plans.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09").
1009759_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	We are evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we may enter into transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to changes in the interest rates results primarily from our Credit Facility borrowings.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2015 we had $13.0 million of outstanding indebtedness subject to interest rate fluctuations.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Based on these borrowings as of March 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the then current LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $0.1 million on an annual basis.
1009759_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from period to period and therefore could result in additional interest.
1009759_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Form 10-K beginning at page F-1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2015, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2015 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms prescribed by the SEC.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Additionally, such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's CEO and CFO and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company's assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 1992 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based on our evaluation under the 1992 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The report of KPMG LLP follows.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting, except for the remediation steps to address the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, although there were no material errors that resulted from control deficiencies, we identified a material weakness in our risk assessment process, specifically our internal controls related to the design of control activities involving FPP revenue, inventory and cost of goods sold as it relates to inventory.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	We have remediated all three of the measures related to the material weakness by enhancing the procedures related to (a) the design of control activities with respect to the completeness and accuracy of our FPP revenue calculation, (b) the adequacy of documentation with respect to certain judgmental determinations used in the inventory reserve analysis and (c) the investigation of inventory discrepancies through subcontractor year-end verification.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Management is committed to improving the Company's internal control processes and believes the remediation measures have strengthened the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have audited Capstone Turbine Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Capstone Turbine Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P10_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	In our opinion, Capstone Turbine Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_15_ITEM9A_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2015, and our report dated June 15, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion of those consolidated financial statements.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P5_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Capstone Turbine Corporation:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P6_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P6_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_15_ITEM15_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P8_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Capstone Turbine Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated June 15, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation (the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ("CHP"), integrated combined heat and power ("ICHP"), and combined cooling, heat and power ("CCHP")), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	In addition, the Company's microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Company was organized in 1988 and has been commercially producing its microturbine generators since 1998.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	Management anticipates incurring additional losses until the Company can produce sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	To date, the Company has funded its activities primarily through private and public equity offerings.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") refers to the Company's fiscal years ending March 31 as its "Fiscal" years.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company's net loss from operations for the Fiscal years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $30.9 million, $15.3 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	The lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2015 and an increase in accounts receivable allowance provided for two customers was the primary cause of the increase in the net loss from operations.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P21_S2	The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 were $32.2 million and $27.9 million, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P21_S3	The Company's working capital requirements during Fiscal 2015 were higher than planned primarily as a result of lower than anticipated inventory turns and reductions to accounts payable as a result of payments made by the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P21_S4	Additionally, the Company did not fully achieve its planned number of product shipments primarily as a result of continuing geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine, the dramatic downturn of the oil and gas markets and a substantially stronger U.S. dollar making our products more expensive overseas.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	Management has the ability to manage certain operating assets and liabilities, specifically the procurement of inventory and timing of payments of accounts payable, capital expenditures and certain operating expenses depending on the results of its operations to extend its cash and cash equivalents.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	In the event that our anticipated cash needs change, it is possible that the Company may need to raise additional capital in the future.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S3	The Company may seek to raise funds by selling additional securities to the public or to selected investors or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S4	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S5	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P22_S6	In addition, any equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Capstone Turbine International, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in June 2004, and Capstone Turbine Singapore Pte., Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in February 2011, after elimination of inter-company transactions.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company considers only those investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase as cash equivalents.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revolving credit facility and notes payable approximate fair market value based on their short-term nature.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements, for disclosure regarding the fair value of other financial instruments.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are typically non-interest bearing.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Inventories The Company values inventories at first in first out ("FIFO") basis and lower of cost or market.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	The composition of inventory is routinely evaluated to identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P27_S3	Included in the assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in the Company's products.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	All inventories expected to be used in more than one year are classified as long-term.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Inventory charges increased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of an allowance for slow-moving inventory related to the waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from two to ten years.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P29_S2	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method with the exception of the backlog of 100 kW microturbines ("TA100") acquired from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ("CPS").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P29_S3	Purchased backlog is amortized based on unit sales and presented as a component of cost of goods sold.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	If the expected future cash flows from the use of such assets (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, the Company may be required to record a write-down, which is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2015 and determined that no impairment was necessary.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, trade name, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of deferred product and service revenue and customer deposits.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	Deferred revenue will be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company has the right to retain all or part of customer deposits under certain conditions.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Revenue The Company's revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ("FPP"), net of discounts.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post-commissioning repair and maintenance service.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company's standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end-users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post-shipment performance obligations by Capstone except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Revenue from the sale of products, parts and accessories is generally recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue will not be recognized until collectability is reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P36_S3	Management's estimates regarding the collectability of a particular sale may impact the timing of actual revenue recognized each period.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Service performed by the Company has consisted primarily of time and materials based contracts.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	The time and materials contracts are usually related to out-of-warranty units.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company also provides maintenance service contracts to customers of its existing installed base.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	The maintenance service contracts are agreements to perform certain services to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	Service revenue derived from maintenance service contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Warranty The Company provides for the estimated costs of warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and geography of sale.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company's product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to eighteen months.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S3	Factors that affect the Company's warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S4	These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P40_S5	Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company's judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company accounts for grant distributions and development funding as offsets to R D expenses and both are recorded as the related costs are incurred.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	Total offsets to R D expenses amounted to $0.5 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the consolidated financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	the differences are expected to reverse.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Contingencies The Company records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Risk Concentrations Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	At March 31, 2015, the majority of our cash balances were held at financial institutions located in California.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	The accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to certain limits.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	Balances that exceed the insurance coverage aggregate to approximately $32.0 million as of March 31, 2015.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC's payment history and because the impact of the recent steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	Diluted loss per share is also computed without consideration to potentially dilutive instruments because the Company incurred losses which would make such instruments antidilutive.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	Outstanding stock options at March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 13.2 million, 12.9 million and 11.8 million, respectively.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).
1009759_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	The ASU was issued as part of FASB's current plan to simplify overly complex standards.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this ASU.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	The update requires retrospective application to all prior period amounts presented.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	We are currently evaluating the potential impacts the new standard will have on our reporting process.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company is evaluating the potential impacts the new standard will have on its reporting process.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ("ASU 2014-12").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P65_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company is evaluating the potential impacts of the new standard on its existing stock-based compensation plans.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company is evaluating its existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, the Company has placed a valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The change in valuation allowance for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $10.6 million, $3.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company's NOL and tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes at March 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The NOLs and federal and state tax credits can be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	Utilization of the NOLs and tax credits are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $57.3 million due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The federal tax credit carryforward is a research and development credit, which may be carried forward.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Tax benefits arising from the disposition of certain shares issued upon exercise of stock options within two years of the date of grant or within one year of the date of exercise by the option holder ("Disqualifying Dispositions") provide the Company with a tax deduction equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Approximately $27.7 million of the Company's federal and state NOL carryforwards as of March 31, 2015 were generated by Disqualifying Dispositions of stock options and exercises of nonqualified stock options.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	In accordance with the reporting requirements under ASC 718, we did not include approximately $10.0 million of excess windfall tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures, as tax attributes related to those windfall tax benefits should not be recognized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	The tax effected amount of gross unrealized net operating loss carry forwards excluded under ASC 718 was approximately $10.0 million at March 31, 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P89_S3	When realized, those excess windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 was $2.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	However, this impact would be offset by an equal increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance as the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets because of uncertainty as to future realization.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P91_S4	The fully reserved recognized federal and state deferred tax assets related to research and development credits balance as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 was $9.7 million and $9.2 million, and $9.5 million and $9.6 million, respectively.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company's computation of expected volatility for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was based on historical volatility.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The expected life, or term, of options granted is derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	Management has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the options' expected term.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	The first performance measurement period began on April 1, 2014 and will end on March 31, 2016; the second performance measurement period has a three-year term that began on April 1, 2014 and will end on March 31, 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	Any earned PRSU awards will vest 50% after the end of the applicable performance measurement period and 50% one year thereafter.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	The weighted average per share grant date fair value of PRSUs granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was $1.56.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P110_S1	Based on our assessment as of March 31, 2015, the PRSU threshold for the first performance measurement likely will not be met and, as a result, the Chief Executive Officer PRSU awards were adjusted and no compensation expense was recorded or recognized during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P110_S2	Any compensation expense will be recognized over the corresponding requisite service period and will be adjusted in subsequent reporting periods if the Company's assessment of the probable level of achievement of the performance goals changes.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P110_S3	The Company will continue to periodically assess the likelihood of the PRSU threshold being met until the end of the applicable performance period.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	Under the Purchase Plan, an aggregate of 900,000 shares may be issued pursuant to the exercise of purchase rights.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P113_S3	In August 2010, the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Purchase Plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P113_S4	The amendment and restatement includes an increase of 500,000 shares of common stock that will be available under the Purchase Plan and extends the term of the Purchase Plan for a period of ten years.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P113_S5	As amended, the Purchase Plan will continue by its terms through June 30, 2020, unless terminated sooner, and will reserve for issuance a total of 1,400,000 shares of common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	The maximum amount that an employee can contribute during a purchase right period is $25,000 or 15% of the employee's regular compensation.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	Under the Purchase Plan, the exercise price of a purchase right is 95% of the fair market value of such shares on the last day of the purchase right period.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P114_S2	The fair market value of the stock is its closing price as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the day in question.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company issued a total of 20,619 shares, 12,302 shares and 22,478 shares of stock, respectively, to regular full and part-time employees or officers of the Company who elected to participate in the Purchase Plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	As of March 31, 2015, there were 409,569 shares available for future grant under the Purchase Plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding 3,800,000 non-qualified common stock options and 93,750 restricted stock units issued outside of the 2000 Plan.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Although the options and restricted stock units were not granted under the 2000 Plan, they are governed by terms and conditions identical to those under the 2000 Plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	All options are subject to the following vesting provisions: one-fourth vest one year after the issuance date and 1 / 48 th vest on the first day of each full month thereafter, so that all options will be vested on the first day of the 48th month after the grant date.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P118_S2	All outstanding options have a contractual term of ten years.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P118_S3	The restricted stock units vest in equal installments over a period of four years.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company has entered into a rights agreement (as amended, the "Rights Agreement") with Computershare Inc., successor-in-interest to Mellon Investor Services LLC, as rights agent.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	In connection with the rights agreement, the Company's board of directors authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each share of the Company's common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, subject to adjustment.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S3	The description and terms of the rights are set forth in the rights agreement.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S4	Initially, the rights are attached to all common stock certificates representing shares then outstanding, and no separate rights certificates are distributed.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P119_S5	Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the rights will separate from the common stock and will be exercisable upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by institutional or certain other stockholders, or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as the Company's Board of Directors shall determine) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer (other than certain permitted offers described in the rights agreement) that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	The third amendment amends the Rights Agreement to provide that the rights will expire on the 30th day after the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders unless continuation of the Rights Agreement is approved by the stockholders at that meeting.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	On August 5, 2014, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the Rights Agreement.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The fourth amendment amends the Rights Agreement to clarify that the term of the Rights Agreement may not be continued or extended unless and until such amendment has received the approval of the stockholders of the Company at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders held prior to the termination of the Rights Agreement without taking into account such amendment.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Rights Agreement is intended to protect the Company's stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	Management believes the Rights Agreement, however, should not affect any prospective offeror willing to make an offer at a fair price and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, as determined by the Board of Directors.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P122_S2	Also, management believes the Rights Agreement should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	Effective May 6, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which it sold 18.8 million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $1.70 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	The shares were allocated to a single institutional investor.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Common Stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $29.8 million.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	Effective March 5, 2012, the Company completed a registered direct placement in which it sold 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, and warrants to purchase 22.6 million shares of common stock with an initial exercise price of $1.55 per share, at a price of $1.11 per unit (the "2012 Warrants").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S1	Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S2	The 2012 Warrants expired on October 31, 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S3	In addition, the Company obtained the right to require investors in the offering to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of 19.0 million additional shares of common stock from the Company (the "Put Options") during two option exercise periods, the first such option exercise period beginning September 10, 2012 and the second such option exercise period beginning March 4, 2013.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S4	Each Put Option was subject to certain conditions which reduced the number of shares that could be sold or eliminate the Put Option.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S5	These conditions included a minimum volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and a minimum average trading volume of the Company's common shares during the 30 trading days prior to the exercise of the Put Option.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P124_S6	The March 2012 sale resulted in net proceeds of approximately $23.1 million net of direct incremental costs of approximately $1.9 million.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	On September 18, 2012, the Company entered into an Investor Agreement with one of the investors in the 2012 registered direct offering pursuant to which the investor agreed to (i) waive the condition precedent to the Company's exercise of the Put Option requiring the arithmetic average of the average daily trading volumes during the measurement period set forth in the subscription agreement between the Company and the investor and on the exercise date be not less than 1.75 million shares and (ii) amend the subscription agreement to provide that the purchase price of the additional shares during the first exercise period would be discounted pursuant to a formula that resulted in a purchase price for the first exercise period of $0.94 per share.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	the Investor Agreement, the Company agreed to amend the exercise price of the 2012 Warrants originally issued to the Investor to $1.26.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	The exercise of the first Put Option resulted in net proceeds of $4.2 million.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P126_S2	The 2012 Warrants still outstanding as of March 31, 2013 provided for the purchase of 22.6 million shares at a weighted average exercise price of $1.41 per share.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	On February 21, 2013, the Company entered into a letter agreement (each a "Letter Agreement" and, collectively, the "Letter Agreements") with each of the investors in the March 5, 2012 registered direct offering.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, the parties evidenced their mutual agreement that the Company would not exercise any portion of the second Put Option.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P127_S2	The Company chose not to exercise the second of the two Put Options because of its improved cash position and its desire to avoid stockholder dilution.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P127_S3	On October 31, 2013, an unsolicited exercise of 2012 Warrants to purchase 4.7 million shares resulted in proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P127_S4	Effective October 31, 2013, all remaining outstanding 2012 Warrants expired.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	The following table outlines the warrant activity:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P129_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_15_ITEM15_P129_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2015 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. Treasury Funds at March 31, 2014.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2014 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	As the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P139_S2	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company has issued common stock warrants at times in the past; however, no warrants are currently outstanding.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P141_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	As discussed above, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on contracts in an entity's own equity that requires the common stock warrants to be classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value at each reporting date recognized in the statement of operations.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P142_S1	The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liability which is measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the "Agreements"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	The line of credit can be increased to an amount up to $20.0 million upon the request of the Company pursuant to the amendment described below (the "Credit Facility").
1009759_15_ITEM15_P143_S2	In addition, Wells Fargo has provided the Company with a non-revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in the Company's business pursuant to the amendment described below.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P143_S3	As of March 31, 2015, the Company had not requested that the maximum line amount be increased to an aggregate of $20.0 million pursuant to the Agreements.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P143_S4	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	One of the Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	The Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo's consent, including covenants that limit the Company's ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company's capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, (f) change the Company's accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	Furthermore, the Agreements contain financial covenants, including (i) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (ii) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum cash balance relative to the outstanding line of credit advances, which was $11.8 million as of March 31, 2015, and (iii) limitations on the Company's annual capital expenditures.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P145_S2	The Agreements also define an event of default to include a material adverse effect on the Company's business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P145_S3	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Several times since entering into the Agreements the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P146_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	On September 16, 2014, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with Wells Fargo.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	The Letter Agreement also, among other things, changed the annual facility fee due to Wells Fargo under the Credit and Security Agreement (Ex-Im Subfacility) and revised the calculation of Capstone's borrowing base under the portion of the Credit Facility established by the Credit and Security Agreement (Ex-Im Subfacility) to increase the borrowing limit related to inventory.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	As of September 30, 2014, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's annual net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S4	On November 3, 2014, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance and entered into an amendment to amend the financial covenants regarding net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S5	As of March 31, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Agreements regarding the Company's annual net income for Fiscal 2015.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P147_S7	As a condition of the amended Agreements, the Company has restricted $5.0 million of cash effective June 10, 2015 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Agreements as described above, the Company would not have been able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	Based on the Company's current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	If a covenant violation were to occur, the Company would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the sum of daily three month London Inter Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), which interest rate shall change whenever daily three month LIBOR changes, plus applicable margin.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	Based on the revolving nature of the Company's borrowings and payments, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P151_S2	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P151_S3	The Company's borrowing rate was 4.0% at each of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	On March 28, 2013, the Company and Prologis, L.P., formerly known as AMB Property, L.P., entered into a third amendment (the "Van Nuys Amendment") to the Lease Agreement dated September 25, 2000, for leased premises used by the Company for engineering testing and manufacturing located in Van Nuys, California.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	At March 31, 2015, the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	In September 2010, the Company was awarded a grant from the DOE for the research, development and testing of a more efficient microturbine Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	Part of the improved efficiency will come from an improved microturbine design, with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and power output of 370 kW. The project is estimated to cost approximately $15.0 million.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	The DOE will contribute $5.0 million toward the project, and the Company will incur approximately $10.0 million in research and development expense.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P159_S3	The contract is over a five-year period and will be completed by September 2015.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P159_S4	The Company billed the DOE under the contract for this project a cumulative amount of $3.9 million through March 31, 2015.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	While the Company has never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in the Company's product technology could result and yield costs to the Company if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P161_S2	As of March 31, 2015, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	From time to time, the Company may become subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) profit-sharing plan in which all employees are eligible to participate.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	Employees may contribute up to Internal Revenue Service annual limits or, if less, 90% of their eligible compensation.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S2	Employees are fully vested in their contributions to the plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S3	The plan also provides for both Company matching and discretionary contributions, which are determined by the Board of Directors.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S4	The Company began matching 50 cents on the dollar up to 4% of the employee's contributions in October 2006.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S5	Prior to that date, no Company contributions had been made since the inception of the plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P163_S6	The Company's match vests 25% a year over four years starting from the employee's hire date.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P294_S0	In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit Plan.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P294_S1	The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P294_S2	No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit under this Plan or from exercising your rights under ERISA.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P296_S2	In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P297_S0	If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, and you have exhausted all administrative remedies provided herein and ERISA, you may tile suit in a federal court.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P297_S1	If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan s money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P297_S2	The court will decide who should pay court costs and fees.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P297_S3	If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
1009759_15_ITEM15_P298_S0	If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.

1009759_15_ITEM15_P320_S0	In connection with the annual report of Capstone Turbine Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), Darren R. Jamison, as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Jayme L. Brooks, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each hereby certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_15_ITEM15_P321_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ( Capstone or the Company ) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ( CHP ), integrated combined heat and power ( ICHP ), and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on site in parallel with the electric grid or stand-alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide on site power generation (also called distributed generation ) such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	Together we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ( FPP ).
1009759_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ( kW ) to one megawatt in electric power output.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our 30 kW ( C30 ) microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	The 65 kW ( C65 ) microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100 room hotel while also providing about one third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our 200 kW ( C200 ) microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S5	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our 600kW, 800kW and 1000 kW ( C1000 Series ) microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our microturbines combine patented air bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S8	Because of our air bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P4_S9	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel.

1009759_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers ( ASPs ), and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	The majority of our distributors provide these services.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10 K (this Form 10 K ) refers to Capstone s fiscal years ending March 31 as its Fiscal years.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ( C60 ), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone s C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO sized container.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	During Fiscal 2016, we booked total net orders of $53.9 million for 273 units, or 54.7 megawatts, compared to $84.5 million for 587 units, or 86.0 megawatts, during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	We shipped 281 units with an aggregate of 60.0 megawatts, generating revenue of $58.4 million compared to 620 units with an aggregate of 91.4 megawatts, generating revenue of $90.4 million during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Total backlog as of March 31, 2016 decreased $56.2 million, or 34%, to $109.6 million from $165.7 million at March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	As of March 31, 2016, we had 593 units, or 113.7 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 787 units, or 182.8 megawatts, at the same date last year.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	Ending backlog as of March 31, 2016, includes the removal of approximately $51.6 million for 186 units, or 63.8 megawatts, from BPC Engineering ( BPC ), one of the Company s Russian distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	This removal, which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015, was a proactive measure taken to align our backlog to management s expectations because of the unsteady global macroeconomic environment experienced during Fiscal 2015, such as the softness of the global oil and gas market, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and on-going geopolitical tensions in Russia.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	In addition, a portion of our TA100 backlog of approximately $2.4 million for 17 units, or 1.7 megawatts, acquired from CPS was removed during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P15_S7	This impairment aligns our TA100 backlog with management s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The following table summarizes our backlog:
1009759_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ( BTU ) gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features: advanced combustion technology, patented air bearing technology, digital power electronics and remote monitoring capability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design geared towards manufacturability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	The air bearing system allows the microturbine s single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum based lubrication.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Air bearings use a high pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine, such as; our electronic controls manage the microturbine s speed, temperature and fuel flow and communication with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand alone mode.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	All control functions are performed digitally.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ( CRMS ) allows end users to operate and manage the microturbine remotely.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Unlike the technology of other power sources that require on site monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to monitor their microturbine systems remotely and efficiently.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also offer C65, C200 and C1000 Series ICHP systems.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	These systems combine the standard C65, C200 and C1000 microturbine unit with an integrated heat recovery module that provides electricity and heats water.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our family of products is offered in the following configurations:
1009759_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, integrated heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand alone or dual mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware.

1009759_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	We have expanded our microturbine s functionality to operate with different fuels.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Capstone microturbine s multi fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our C65 grid connect and stand alone microturbines are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ( UL ) as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certified.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its Rule 21 grid interconnection standard.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site by site and utility by utility analysis.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre cleared our microturbines for connection to New York s electric utility grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand alone operation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous area oil and gas applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid connect and stand alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid connect and stand alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back up generators as small as 2 kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Within the markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near term potential.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	In the markets we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 80% or more.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	Our microturbines emissions of commonly found air pollutants ( criteria pollutants ), such as nitrogen oxides ( NOx ), carbon monoxide ( CO ) and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ), are lower than those from the on site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P40_S5	This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Each dual-mode microturbine can operate as a microgrid with the ability to run with or independent of a traditional grid or utility.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The use of microgrids to serve local loads helps to reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the microgrid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end users by lowering their overall cost to operate and provide versatile technology that runs on varying fuels and scales to fit a wide variety of applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	The microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Capstone introduced the C65 and C200 stand alone digester products in the renewable energy market segment in 2007 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	These products are targeted at remote villages in third world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 digester gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable source of power generation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	In some cases these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone s microturbine for reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	In mid 2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	The addressable market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is significant.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	The shale gas market for microturbines may grow as demand for natural gas continues to rise and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), the Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	Capstone has been invited to participate in numerous Natural Gas STAR workshops in the United States and foreign markets to demonstrate the emissions reductions our technology can provide.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	The C200 product can be configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Capstone also offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology, health care and information systems facilities require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies ( UPS ) to protect critical loads from momentary power disturbances along with backup diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Capstone offers an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Capstone has developed the world s only microturbine-powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and backup diesel generators.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We offer two microturbine powered UPS solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	The Capstone UPSource microturbine powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	Capstone s Hybrid UPS microturbine-powered solution provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent backup.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	Our microturbine powered UPS solutions are UL listed.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	These integrated solutions are ideal for new construction or facility expansion and have been installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency and reduce operating costs compared with traditional solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back up power system with an economic return.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	These systems offer high on-site energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than ten seconds.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	Capstone microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line interactive continuous power solution.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ( HEV ) applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our customers have applied our products in HEVs such as transit buses and trucks.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary engine.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our marine customers use both our liquid fueled and natural gas products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	receive the same benefits as users of stationary Capstone products: low emissions with no aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our world wide distribution network is our most valuable intangible asset that we have proudly developed from the ground up.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Each one of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner of Capstone marketing and selling the Capstone products and services on our behalf.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 24 months from shipment depending on the product type.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power and mobile products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas and public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P65_S4	Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our target markets in Latin America are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Oil and gas production projects continue to be a growing market in Latin America.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Recent energy reform in Mexico has opened new market opportunities by allowing competition and enabling power generation companies to sell directly to consumers instead of only to the state owned Federal Electricity Commission.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Capstone s strategy in Mexico is to leverage our distribution network in Mexico across various market verticals.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for Capstone based on a number of factors, including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	While Capstone has distributors in nearly all South American countries, management is focused on what we consider to be the top markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our target markets in Asia and Australia are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the CHP, CCHP and the oil and gas market.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	China is expected to see growth in the oil and gas market, while biogas recovery is showing signs of growth in Southeast Asia.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our target market in the Middle East and Africa is primarily oil and gas.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	Flare gas to power projects are a particularly attractive market opportunity given the volume of gas being flared and the acute and chronic need for stable power in the region.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Management has targeted distributors and customers involved in the capture and use of flare gas in the oil and gas market.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	However, the geopolitical environment in this region is still volatile, which can impact our sales.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	During Fiscal 2016, the pace of economic recovery in Europe was slow and demand remained soft with a decrease in revenue of 43%, primarily from Russia, compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Further, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could continue to negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	For more information, see Risk Factors beginning on Page 16 of this Form 10 K.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	For geographic and segment revenue information, please see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ( Horizon ), one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 15%, 17% and 12% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Sales to E Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ( E Finity), one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 11% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	Sales to Dtc Soluciones Inmobiliarias S.A. de C.V. ( DTC ), one of the Company s Mexican distributors, accounted for 10% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Sales to Optimal Group Australia Pty Ltd ( Optimal ), one of the Company s Australian distributors, accounted for 10% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S4	Sales to BPC Engineering ( BPC ), one of the Company s Russian distributors, accounted for 2%, 11% and 17% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S5	Additionally, DTC, Optimal, Reliable Secure Power Systems, one of the Company s domestic distributors ( RSP ), and Regale Energy Zrt, the Company s Hungarian distributor ( Regale ), accounted for 28%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P78_S6	Optimal accounted for 17% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We recorded bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	We recorded bad debt expense of approximately $10.1 million and $0.2 million during Fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	During Fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowances from BPC and Electro Mecanique Industries ( EMI ), one of the Company s distributors in the Middle East and Africa, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by American DG Energy Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz Corporation, GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, Tecogen, Inc. and W rtsil Corporation, among others.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc., Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	However, over the medium to long term, fuel cell technology companies may introduce products that compete more directly with our microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	Overall, we compete with end users other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine s ability to:
1009759_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S6	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S7	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P94_S8	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	Capstone continues to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone s low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	In California, A.B. 1530 recently was approved by the Senate Energy Committee and will be heard next by the Senate Environmental Quality Committee.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	This bill may stimulate the market in California for Capstone products by revising utility charges and standby rates that apply to distributed generation projects.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S3	We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S4	In the wake of numerous destructive storms, several state and local governments are putting greater value in resilient distributed generation resources, including CHP and microgrids, and even reassessing the traditional utility model.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P95_S5	However, utilities in other states have asked public utility commissioners to revisit incentive programs and exemptions from grid usage charges for distributed generation technologies, arguing that these policies shift costs to other rate payers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	There are certain recent federal funding solicitations that may support microturbine development.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P97_S3	We cannot provide any assurance that any proposal Capstone submits will be funded.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for certain clean energy technologies, including CHP, microturbines and fuel cells among others, is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	There are bipartisan efforts underway to extend the ITC an additional five years, similar to the extension provided for solar energy technology projects.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P98_S2	Unless it is extended, we may see an impact on our sales in the United States due to the loss of this 10% tax credit.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P98_S3	However, other CHP and gas-fired distributed energy technology-providers will face the same financial hurdle and the loss of the ITC would level the playing field with fuel cell technologies, which currently receive a 30% ITC.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume and low cost production objectives.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S3	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S4	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S5	We have an on going program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S6	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P99_S7	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P100_S2	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P100_S3	Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be impacted by the softness of the global oil and gas markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P100_S4	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	We have a combined total of approximately 102,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	We assemble and test units as well as manufacture air bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S4	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P101_S5	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ( Solar ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P102_S2	The cores are subject to a per unit royalty fee which continues for the duration of Solar s intellectual property that underlies the licensing agreement.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P102_S3	As of March 31, 2016, cumulative royalties of $0.6 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	The Company is a party to a Development and License Agreement ( Development Agreement ) with Carrier Corporation ( Carrier ) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of the Company s C200 microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	As of March 31, 2016, cumulative royalties of $16.6 million have been paid under the terms of the Development Agreement with Carrier will continue until the obsolescence of the C200 microturbine product line.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	We devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, R D expenses were $10.2 million, $9.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 12%, 8% and 7% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P105_S2	Benefits from cost sharing programs were $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $1.4 million for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P106_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand alone basis.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P107_S1	A few of the key upgrades include integrated heat recovery for CHP and CCHP applications, two-stage air filtration system, improved enclosure, relocated engine exhaust stack and redesigned discharge for enclosure cooling air.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	The C1000S is one of the world s most integrated and compact 1MW CHP solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	The 8-foot wide by 30-foot long 1MW power plant reaches approximately 82% total system efficiency and is significantly quieter than the original C1000 for installation in low-noise urban environments.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	During Fiscal 2015 we made significant development in variants of the C1000 Series product line.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	A liquid fuel version of the C1000 Series was produced with the use of Capstone s lean premix combustion technology based on the development work done previously with the C200 liquid fuel system.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone s microturbine products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	Digester gas C1000 was produced to run off the Palm Oil Milling Effluent ( POME ) biogas produced as a byproduct of the palm oil extraction process.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	Advancement realized in both of these products opens up new markets for Capstone and also allows for further development possibilities in the areas of liquid fuel and biogas.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	During Fiscal 2014 we achieved compliance with the German low voltage requirements, which have been adopted throughout much of Europe.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S1	During Fiscal 2015 we continued to make improvements to all our microturbine products to be compliant with other widely adopted European low and medium voltage grid inter connect requirements for decentralized power generation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S2	During Fiscal 2016 our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines were certified for multiple European Grid Interconnection standards.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S3	These new standards, which are Verband der Elektrotechnik ( VDE ), Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft (BDEW) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano ( CEI ), were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S4	With this certification, Capstone s C200 and C1000 Series microturbines are capable of operating through periods of lower grid voltage, also known as low voltage ride through ( LVRT ), without any adverse effects on performance or reliability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P111_S5	LVRT capability is important because it ensures that the microturbines can ride through the low voltage period, especially for mission critical facilities, such as hospitals and data centers.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	The VDE, BDEW and CEI requirements for power generation products and plants are based on unit behavior during cases of grid disturbances.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	In addition, we continue to work both cost reduction and performance enhancement activities to improve the value of our microturbine products for our customer base.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P114_S1	Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency, thereby reducing our customers total cost of ownership.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	Because of Capstone s single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P115_S1	Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P115_S2	Although we believe the hybrid electric bus and truck market has the potential to be a beneficial option for the bus and truck manufacturers, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P115_S3	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P116_S0	Capstone is working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P116_S1	This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine based hybrid solution.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P116_S2	The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is currently being retrofitted with a refrigerated box body and should be ready for track testing at Kenworth facilities later in the year.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P116_S3	The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the San Joaquin Valley in California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P116_S4	Capstone expects to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P117_S0	A prototype or concept vehicle may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P118_S0	Capstone also worked with Peterbilt Motors to develop a series hybrid drivetrain as part of a concept Class 8 tractor for Walmart.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P119_S0	The Walmart Advanced Vehicle Experience ( WAVE ) concept truck is the latest in Walmart s fleet efficiency program.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P119_S1	The WAVE concept truck has advanced aerodynamics and is powered by a Capstone C30 range extending microturbine in its hybrid powertrain.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P119_S2	This futuristic concept truck was unveiled at the Mid America Trucking Show in March 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P119_S3	Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P119_S4	As such, Capstone is working with both Peterbilt and Walmart as they continue to showcase the WAVE truck at various expos and hybrid vehicle shows around the country.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	Capstone s liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines ( HDDE ).
1009759_16_ITEM1_P120_S1	The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P121_S1	Capstone s compressed natural gas ( CNG ) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On Road HDDE for Urban Bus.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P121_S2	Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	Capstone s marine products can be used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, hotel power, CHP, or CCHP.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P122_S1	They are especially ideal for small and mid size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas ( ECAs ).
1009759_16_ITEM1_P122_S2	Capstone has also working with major marine certifying bodies (Lloyd s Register and DNV GL) on Type Approval for its marine products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P122_S3	Type Approval provides independent product verification that the product conforms to recognized industry quality standards, International Conventions and/or Marine Classification Society Rules, through a process of independent design review, sample testing and verification of production controls.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P123_S1	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	Capstone s C65 Hybrid UPS product line has been evolving over the years.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S1	After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University s data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, Capstone s C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has recent installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, California and Capstone s own data center in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S2	The product utilizes Capstone s inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer s critical load.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S3	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S4	Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S5	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone s multipack feature.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S6	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P124_S7	Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, the low emissions Capstone Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year-round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	Although we believe the industrial UPS market has the potential to be a beneficial option for businesses that require constant supply of reliable energy, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C65 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	Capstone is working with the DOE on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery and advanced AFA (Alumina Forming Austenitic) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ).
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	In March 2013, Capstone successfully completed proof of concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S3	This allowed Capstone to proceed with high pressure spool development which was completed during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S4	Capstone also demonstrated an increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S5	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S6	The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P126_S7	The final phase of the program will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits end users through lower operating costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat resistant steel alloys used in Capstone microturbines at a significantly reduced cost.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, know how , and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P129_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 102 U.S. and 28 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_16_ITEM1_P129_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2016 and 2027.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P129_S3	We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P130_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	As of March 31, 2016, we had 191 employees.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	We consider relations with our employees to be good.
1009759_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	This Form 10 K, as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) are made available free of charge on the Company s Internet website (http://www.capstoneturbine.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

1009759_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few customers and limited repeat business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of worldwide capital markets could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We maintain two Credit and Security Agreements (the Credit Agreements ), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, ( Wells Fargo ), that provide us with a credit facility up to $20.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	At March 31, 2016, we had $9.5 million in borrowings outstanding under this line of credit.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under this credit facility, we are required to satisfy specified financial and restrictive covenants.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately or allow Wells Fargo to terminate the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	patents and other assets as collateral under the Credit Agreements which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Several times since entering into the Credit Agreements, we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Agreements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Credit Agreements in response to the default.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As of September 30, 2015, we were not in compliance with the annual net income financial covenant contained in the Credit Agreements, as amended.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	On November 2, 2015, we received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we had not obtained the default waivers, or if we are ever again in noncompliance, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Credit Agreements also define an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	For more information, see the section below entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to build sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue as a going concern on a longer term basis.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer term basis.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain a credit facility acceptable to the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Impairment charges on our long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders equity.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Any reliability or quality issues that may arise with our products could prevent or delay scheduled deliveries or adversely impact the performance of our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any such delays or costs could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We also outsource certain of our components internationally.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S5	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Capstone microturbines compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	This could enhance our competitors abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our competitors include several well known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Because of greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis vis our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We derived approximately 2% and 11% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting certain oil and gas production related business activities with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies and requiring export licenses for certain of such activities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government could be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of March 31, 2014 because a material weakness was detected which related to our risk assessment process.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Management determined that this material weakness was remediated during the 2015 fiscal year.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	We may in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Because of OEMs and distributors relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenue from these relationships.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the microturbine business of CPS, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $13.6 million and $13.1 million as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ( DSO ) at the end of Fiscal 2016 was 66 days, compared with 40 days at the end of Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We recorded bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million and bad debt expense of approximately $10.1 million during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Horizon, E-Finity, DTC and Optimal accounted for approximately 15%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Additionally, DTC, Optimal, RSP, and Regale, accounted for 28%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The loss of Horizon, E-Finity, DTC, Optimal or any other significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P71_S8	Non compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P74_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on site generation.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The sale of our products in many cases involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products has been lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P88_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P88_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Potential intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	From time to time, we may face litigation relating to intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder and other matters.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Further, our insurance coverage is limited for these and other claims against us, and we may not have adequate insurance or financial resources to pay for our liabilities or losses from any such claims.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P93_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by risks related to cyber security threats.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P95_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, the services we provide to customers, the competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation or our stock price.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P97_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	At March 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $652 million and $181 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P99_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P101_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P101_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P104_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S2	On December 19, 2014, when our common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S3	On June 22, 2015, we transferred the listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market and were afforded an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S4	We subsequently regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by effecting a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P106_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	If we continue to fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P107_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P109_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	further decreases in or continued low levels of oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P111_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P111_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P112_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	In March 2016, the Company received a letter from VCM Group LLC, an owner of 200 shares of the Company s common stock giving notice of such stockholder s intention to nominate nine director candidates for election to the Company s board of directors at the Company s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders will ensue, or that we could become engaged in a proxy contest with another activist stockholder in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	A proxy contest and any related litigation would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by management, our board of directors and employees, and would divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P116_S2	We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors, management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P116_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above or the outcome of a proxy contest or any related litigation.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	It also is possible that the director candidates of the stockholder that submitted the March 2016 notice letter, if nominated by such stockholder for election to the Company s board of directors at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, could constitute a majority of our board of directors following the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Similarly, a future proxy contest with any other activist investor could result in the turnover of a majority of our board of directors.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P117_S2	If such a change in the composition of our board of directors were to occur, it could trigger the change of control provisions of certain agreements and arrangements to which the Company is a party, including the Credit Agreements, the Company s Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, between the Company and Darren Jamison, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Under the Credit Agreements, a change of control constitutes an event of default that would entitle Wells Fargo to, among other remedies, declare all of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements immediately due and payable.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, following a change of control, upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination of Mr. Jamison or certain of the Company s other executive officers and employees, the Company will be obligated to make specified severance payments to the terminated employee.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P120_S0	If such a change in our board composition were to occur, and if our board of directors were unable to take certain mitigating action to avoid triggering, or if the Company were unable to obtain a waiver of, these and other similar change of control provisions to which the Company is subject, the resulting payments and other obligations required of the Company could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P122_S1	These provisions include our board s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P124_S0	On May 6, 2016, the Company and Computershare Inc., as Rights Agent, entered into a Rights Agreement (the NOL Rights Agreement ) designed to diminish the risk that the Company s ability to use its net operating losses and certain other tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of the Company experiencing an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P124_S1	While this NOL Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our net operating losses, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from becoming 4.99% stockholders.
1009759_16_ITEM1A_P124_S2	The NOL Rights Agreement could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
1009759_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	This lease expires in September 2019, and we have one five year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	This lease will expire in December 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Two putative securities class action complaints were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the following captions: David Kinney, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-08914 on November 16, 2015 (the Kinney Complaint ) and Kevin M. Grooms, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-09155 on December 18, 2015 (the Grooms Complaint ).
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	The putative class in the Kinney Complaint is comprised of all purchasers of the Company s securities between November 7, 2013 and November 5, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Kinney Complaint alleges material misrepresentations and omissions in public statements regarding BPC and the likelihood that BPC would not be able to fulfill many legal and financial obligations to the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Kinney Complaint also alleges that the Company s financial statements were not appropriately adjusted in light of this situation and were not maintained in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company lacked adequate internal controls over accounting.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Kinney Complaint alleges that these public statements and accounting irregularities constituted violations by all named defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by the individual defendants.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	The Grooms Complaint makes allegations and claims that are substantially identical to those in the Kinney Complaint, and both complaints seek compensatory damages of an undisclosed amount.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S5	On January 16, 2016, several shareholders filed motions to consolidate the Kinney and Grooms actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S6	On February 29, 2016, the Court granted the motions to consolidate, and appointed a lead plaintiff.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S7	On May 6, 2016, a Consolidated Amended Complaint with allegations and claims substantially identical to those of the Kinney Complaint was filed in the consolidated action.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S8	The putative class period in the Consolidated Amended Complaint is June 12, 2014 to November 5, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S9	Defendants motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint is due June 17, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P1_S10	The Company has not recorded any liability as of March 31, 2016 since any potential loss is not probable or reasonably estimable given the preliminary nature of the proceedings.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On February 18, 2016, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in the State of California against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors under the following caption: Stesiak v. Jamison, et al., No. BC610782.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	but allowed the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding BPC and the Company s financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to timely adjust the Company s account receivables and backlog to reflect BPC s inability to pay the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S2	The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S3	It demands damages for the amount of damage sustained by the Company as a result of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, that the Company institute corporate governance reforms, and disgorgement from the individual defendants.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S4	On May 5, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking to stay this action until such time as the defendants motion(s) to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P3_S5	On May 10, 2016, the Court entered that proposed order, and scheduled a status conference for August 24, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	On May 25, 2016, we received a pre-filing copy of a purported shareholder derivative action entitled Velma Kilpatrick v. Simon, et al., purportedly to be filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in the State of California against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The complaint alleges that certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors knew or should have known that BPC would be unable to fulfill its obligations to the Company, but allowed the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding BPC and the Company s financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to timely adjust the Company s account receivables and backlog to reflect BPC s inability to pay the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P4_S3	The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P4_S4	It demands damages for the amount of damage sustained by the Company as a result of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties, and that the Company institute corporate governance reforms .
1009759_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	The lawsuit alleges that certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors knew or should have known that BPC would be unable to fulfill its obligations to the Company, but allowed the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding BPC and the Company s financial condition.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	The complaint asserts a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P5_S2	It demands damages for the amount of damage sustained by the Company as a result of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties, and equitable relief, including that the Company institute appropriate corporate governance reforms.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P5_S3	On May 11, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking to stay this action until such time as the defendants motion(s) to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided.
1009759_16_ITEM3_P5_S4	On May 13, 2016, the Court entered that proposed order .
1009759_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CPST .
1009759_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for each period indicated.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of June 3, 2016, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $1.44 per share.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of June 3, 2016, there were 223 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include the number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or street name accounts through brokers.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock.
1009759_16_ITEM5_P3_S2	In the future, the decision to pay any cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and capital expenditure plans, as well as such other factors as our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant.

1009759_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected in the future.
1009759_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	Loss per share amounts for all periods has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Company s 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective November 6, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Annual Report.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Capstone is the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (combined heat and power ( CHP ) and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	During Fiscal 2016 our net loss decreased by 20% to $25.2 million and our net loss per share decreased by 28% to $1.39 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The decrease in the net loss during Fiscal 2016 reflected a decrease in bad debt expense relating to two customers recorded during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	This was offset by lower revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our gross margin was 15% for Fiscal 2016, which represents a decrease of approximately 100 basis points from our gross margin of 16% for Fiscal 2015 despite 26% lower revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	Capstone made improvements diversifying its revenue into the energy efficiency and renewal energy vertical markets even with the softness of the oil and gas markets during Fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S5	During Fiscal 2016, we continued to see increasing revenue from our aftermarket service primarily as a result of further acceptance of our comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ( FPP ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S6	Fiscal 2016 was characterized by lower revenue and megawatts shipped compared to Fiscal 2015 because of the continuing softness of the global oil and gas markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P4_S7	Please see Results of Operations on page 41 for further discussion of the lower revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Capstone products continue to gain interest in all six of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The renewable energy market is fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our product sales in the oil and gas and other natural resources market is driven by our microturbines reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We have also seen increased interest in critical power supply applications as customers want solutions that can handle both primary and backup power.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	In addition, management closely monitors operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The key drivers to Capstone s success are revenue growth, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	To support our opportunities to grow in our targeted markets, we continue to enhance the reliability and performance of our products by developing new processes and enhancing training to assist those who apply, install and use our products.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near term potential.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, marine and transportation products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	During Fiscal 2016, we booked orders for 54.7 megawatts and shipped 60.0 megawatts of products, which combined with our backlog of 182.8 megawatts at March 31, 2015, resulted in 113.7 megawatts in backlog as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Ending backlog as of March 31, 2016, includes the removal of approximately 63.8 megawatts, from BPC.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our product shipments in Fiscal 2016 were: 53% for use in energy efficiency applications, 37% for use in natural resources applications and 10% for use in renewable energy applications.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Energy efficiency applications use both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 80% or more.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce variable production costs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Capstone s microturbines can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding area.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Capstone s microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these applications and outperform conventional combustion engines in a number of situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable critical source of power generation.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	In many cases these oil and gas or mining operations have no access to an electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone s microturbines for a reliable low emission power supply.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users, such as high technology and information systems companies, require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Management believes that Capstone s critical power supply offerings are the world s only microturbine powered Uninterruptible Power Source solutions that can offer clean, IT grade power produced from microturbines, the utility or a combination of both.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle ( HEV ) applications.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our customers have applied our products in hybrid electric mobile applications, including transit buses and trucks.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as ship auxiliaries.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Sales and Distribution Channels We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	A significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to distributors who resell our products to end users.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	We have a total of 104 distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	In the United States and Canada, we currently have 24 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	Outside of the United States and Canada, we currently have 80 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	We continue to refine our distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Service We provide service primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Together with our global distribution network we offer a comprehensive FPP.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Through our global distribution network, we offer a our FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	We provide factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 was $66.5 million and $61.2 million, respectively, which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2033.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Service revenue in Fiscal 2016 was approximately 14% of total revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Additionally, we offer new and remanufactured parts through our global distribution network.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Product Robustness and Life Cycle Maintenance Costs We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance cost to our customers.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	We are currently focusing efforts on enhancing our products to improve reliability and reduce direct material costs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	During the three months ended September 30, 2015 our C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became Verband der Elektrotechnik ( VDE ) and Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft ( BDEW ) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano ( CEI ) certified.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P23_S5	These new standards were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We are also developing a more efficient microturbine CHP system with the support of the DOE.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	We successfully completed the first phase of the development program and achieved 270 kW with a prototype C250 microturbine in our development test lab.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	The DOE awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program, of which $4.2 million was allocated to us, and was used through September 30, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	The contract was completed on September 30, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Signature Series microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	A few of the key upgrades include integrated heat recovery for CHP and CCHP applications, two-stage air filtration system, improved enclosure, relocated engine exhaust stack and redesigned discharge for enclosure cooling air.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The C1000S is one of the world s most integrated and compact 1MW CHP solutions.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We believe that the core competencies of Capstone products are air bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our core intellectual property is contained within our air bearing technology.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Management believes that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone s promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we generate $25 million in quarterly revenue with a 25% gross margin.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	The estimated fair value of the assets is determined using the best information available.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2016 and as a result, approximately $0.1 million of TA100 backlog was written off to align with management s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	See Note 5 Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ( FIFO ) basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write downs are required.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write downs of inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post commissioning service.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically non interest bearing.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days past payment terms.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the amount of net deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The use of Black Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the Company s actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents the Company s best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Risk free interest rate We used the yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	The amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	We review historical forfeiture data and determine the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	We re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	Generally, we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2016 decreased $30.3 million, or 26%, to $85.2 million from $115.5 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 included decreases in revenue of $12.4 million from the European and Russian markets, $12.2 million from the United States and Canada markets, $2.5 million from the Latin America markets, $1.9 million from the Asian and Australian markets and $1.3 million from the African market.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	The decreases in the European and Russian, Asian and Australian and African markets were primarily the result of ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia and Ukraine and a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) compared to Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	The decrease in the United States and Canada markets were because of the effects of reductions in microturbines shipped, resulting from continued softness in the oil and gas market and a shift in customers project timelines.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	For Fiscal 2016, revenue from microturbine products decreased $31.0 million, or 35%, to $58.4 million from $89.4 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2016 decreased 31.4 megawatts, or 34%, to 60.0 megawatts from 91.4 megawatts during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in revenue and megawatts was because of volume reductions in microturbines shipped, resulting from a 90% reduction in microturbine product shipments to Russia, continued softness in the oil and gas market and shift in customers project timelines during Fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Average revenue per megawatt shipped was approximately $1.0 million during each of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	For Fiscal 2016, revenue from our accessories and parts decreased $0.6 million, or 4%, to $14.7 million from $15.3 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease in revenue from accessories and parts was primarily from lower accessories revenue as a result of volume reductions in microturbines shipped.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Service revenue for Fiscal 2016 increased $1.3 million, or 12%, to $12.1 million from $10.8 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase in service revenue resulted primarily from higher FPP contract enrollment.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ( Horizon ), one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 15%, 17% and 12% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ( E-Finity), one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 11% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	Sales to Dtc Soluciones Inmobiliarias S.A. de C.V. ( DTC ), one of the Company s Mexican distributors, accounted for 10% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	Sales to Optimal Group Australia Pty Ltd ( Optimal ), one of the Company s Australian distributors, accounted for 10% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Sales to BPC accounted for 2%, 11% and 17% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	The gross margin was $12.8 million, or 15% of revenue, for Fiscal 2016 compared to a gross margin of $18.3 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Of the $5.5 million decrease in the gross margin during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015, $12.7 million was primarily the result of a lower volume of microturbines shipped and a shift in product mix.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	This reduction in gross margin was partially offset by decreases in warranty expense of $3.4 million, variable production and service center manufacturing expenses of $2.4 million, inventory charges of $1.0 million and royalty expense of $0.4 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	Management continues to implement initiatives to improve gross margin by further reducing manufacturing overhead and fixed and direct material costs as we work to achieve profitability and improving product performance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $3.4 million reflects a decrease in the standard warranty provision primarily because of a decrease in the number of units covered under warranty as a result of the lower volume of microturbines shipped during Fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	as the product reliability continued to improve.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Management expects warranty expense to increase as a result of higher shipments of microturbine products for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased $2.4 million during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 as a result of decreases in freight expense of $1.2 million, salaries expense of $0.7 million, supplies expense of $0.5 million, business travel expense of $0.2 million and consulting expense of $0.3 million, offset by lower overhead allocated to finished goods inventory of $0.4 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	In addition, a portion of our TA100 intangible asset backlog of approximately $0.1 million was written off during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	This impairment aligns our TA100 intangible asset backlog with management s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Inventory charges decreased $1.0 million during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 primarily as the result of a decrease in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	During Fiscal 2016, we made an allowance of approximately $0.8 million for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Royalty expense decreased $0.4 million during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of lower sales of our C1000 Series systems.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table summarizes our gross margin (in millions except percentages):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Microturbine products gross margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 10% during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of a lower volume of microturbines shipped and a shift in product mix.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Service gross margin decreased 700 basis points to 12% during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 primarily because of timing of FPP services performed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Research and Development Expenses( R D ) R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	R D expenses for Fiscal 2016 increased $0.5 million, or 5%, to $10.2 million from $9.7 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	The overall increase in R D expenses of approximately $0.5 million resulted from increases in supplies expense of approximately $0.7 million, consulting expense of $0.2 million and a decrease in cost-sharing benefits of $0.3 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	These overall increases were offset by a $0.7 million decrease in salaries expense.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P71_S5	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2017 to be lower than in Fiscal 2016 as a result of the successful launch of the C1000 Signature Series microturbine and our postponement in development of the C250 microturbine.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses SG A expenses for Fiscal 2016 decreased $12.4 million, or 31%, to $27.1 million from $39.5 million for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The net decrease in SG A expenses was comprised of decreases of $11.6 million in bad debt expense, $0.7 million in business travel expense and $0.1 million in marketing expense.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	recorded for two customers during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Excluding bad debt recovery, management expects SG A expenses in Fiscal 2017 to be lower than in Fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses and achieve profitability.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $0.1 million, or 20%, to $0.6 million during Fiscal 2016 from $0.5 million during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Interest expense is primarily from the average balances outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $9.5 million outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $0.1 million, or 83%, to $20,000 during Fiscal 2016 from $118,000 during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Income tax expense incurred was related to state and foreign taxes.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The effective income tax rate of 0.1% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 35% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	At March 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $652 million and $181 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $252.3 million at March 31, 2016 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	Similarly, at March 31, 2015, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2015 decreased $17.6 million, or 13%, to $115.5 million from $133.1 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 included decreases in revenue of $12.3 million from the European market, $4.3 million from the African market, $3.9 million from the North American market and $1.5 million from the Asian market.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	The decrease in the European market was primarily the result of the continuing geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar making our product more expensive overseas compared to Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	The revenue decline during Fiscal 2015 in the North American market was primarily the result of a drop in the oil and gas market which has affected the timing of customer demand for our products compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	Revenue from the Asian and African markets decreased during Fiscal 2015 because of the impact of a decline in the oil and gas market and stronger U.S. dollar.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	These overall decreases in revenue were offset by increases in revenue of $3.6 million from the Australian market and $0.8 million from the South American market.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P78_S6	The increase in the Australian and South American markets was primarily the result of our continued efforts to improve distribution channels.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Megawatts shipped, microturbine units shipped and average revenue per unit decreased primarily as a result of lower sales volume and shift in product mix for our microturbines during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Revenue from microturbine products during Fiscal 2015 decreased $19.4 million, or 18%, to $89.4 million from $108.8 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Microturbine megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2015 decreased 18.5 megawatts to 91.4 megawatts from 109.9 megawatts for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	Microturbine units shipped during Fiscal 2015 decreased 51 units to 620 units from 671 units shipped during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S4	Average revenue per unit shipped decreased for Fiscal 2015 to approximately $144,000 compared to approximately $162,000 per unit for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P79_S5	The decrease in average revenue per unit was primarily the result of a decrease in shipments of our C1000 Series systems partially offset by an increase in shipments of our C65 microturbines during Fiscal 2015 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	For Fiscal 2015, revenue from our accessories, parts and service increased $1.8 million, or 7%, to $26.1 million from $24.3 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase in revenue resulted primarily from higher FPP contract enrollment and sales of microturbine parts, partially offset by lower sales of microturbine service work.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Therefore, we evaluate historical revenue in conjunction with backlog to anticipate the growth trend of our revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Sales to Horizon, one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 17%, 12% and 27% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	Sales to BPC, accounted for 11%, 17% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	Sales to E-Finity, one of the Company s domestic distributors, accounted for 19% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The gross margin was $18.3 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2015 compared to a gross margin of $21.7 million, or 16% of revenue, for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	The change in the gross margin during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 was driven by multiple factors including lower royalty expense of $1.2 million, lower production and service center labor and overhead expense of $1.0 million and lower warranty expense of $0.4 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	The positive impact of these factors was offset by the adverse impact of lower volume, lower average selling prices and a change in product mix for our microturbines of $5.0 million and higher inventory charges of $1.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Royalty expense decreased $1.2 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 as a result of a reduction in the predetermined fixed rate royalty.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	We pay a predetermined fixed rate royalty for each microturbine system covered by our Development and License Agreement with Carrier.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The fixed rate royalty was reduced by 50% during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of the contractual reduction.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as the result of decreases in service center travel expense of approximately $0.3 million, facilities expense of $0.3 million, salaries expense of $0.2 million and supplies expense of $0.2 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $0.4 million reflects a decrease in the standard warranty provision as a result of sales volume and a decrease in reliability repair programs during Fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Inventory charges increased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of an allowance for slow-moving inventory related to our waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we shipped approximately $0.7 million of product to BPC.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	Given the uncertainty as to the collectability of the sale, revenue recognition on this shipment was deferred.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	as we do not have title to the product or rights to receive the product back in the event we are not paid, such amounts were expensed through cost of goods sold for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following table summarizes our gross margin (in millions except percentages):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Microturbine products gross margin decreased approximately 300 basis points to 12% during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of lower volume, lower average selling prices and a change in product mix.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Accessories and parts gross margin increased 900 basis points to 38% during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 because of shipments of high margin microturbine products accessories.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	Service gross margin increased 300 basis points to 19% during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily because of timing of FPP services performed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Research and Development Expenses R D expenses include compensation, engineering department expenses, overhead allocations for administration and facilities and materials costs associated with development.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	R D expenses for Fiscal 2015 increased $0.7 million, or 8%, to $9.7 million from $9.0 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost-sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	During Fiscal 2015 cost sharing benefits decreased approximately $0.9 million offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in professional services expense.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	There were approximately $0.5 million of cost-sharing benefits for Fiscal 2015 and $1.4 million of such benefits for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Cost-sharing programs vary from period to period depending on the phase of the programs.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A expenses for Fiscal 2015 increased $11.5 million, or 41%, to $39.5 million from $28.0 million for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	The net increase in SG A expenses was comprised of increases of $9.9 million in bad debt expense, $0.9 million in salaries expense, $0.6 million in professional services expense, which includes legal expense, $0.4 million in marketing expense and $0.1 million in business travel expense, offset by a decreases of $0.2 million in facilities expense and $0.2 million in supplies expense.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The increase in the bad debt expense was primarily the result of accounts receivable allowances recorded for BPC and EMI, one of the Company s distributors in the Middle East and Africa, during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from BPC.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S4	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC s recent payment history and because the impact of the steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S5	Also during three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to EMI.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P96_S6	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI s payment history.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 29%, to $0.5 million during Fiscal 2015 from $0.7 million during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Interest expense is primarily from the average balances outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	As of March 31, 2015, we had total debt of $13.0 million outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability Effective September 23, 2013, warrants issued in connection with the September 23, 2008 registered direct placement to purchase 4.0 million shares expired, and the liability associated with the warrants was reversed.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The reversal of the warrant liability resulted in a benefit of approximately $10,000 for Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	This reversal of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $0.1 million, or 50%, to $0.1 million during Fiscal 2015 from $0.2 million during Fiscal 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Income tax expense incurred was related to state and foreign taxes.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	The effective income tax rate of -0.4% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 37% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	At March 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $626 million and $202 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $246.8 million at March 31, 2015 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	Similarly, at March 31, 2014, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	This information was prepared in accordance with GAAP, and, in the opinion of management, contains all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere herein.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our operating results for any prior quarters may not necessarily indicate the results for any future periods.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Loss per-share amounts for all periods has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Company s 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective November 6, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded approximately $1.4 million in bad debt recovery with respect to the collection of cash for receivables from EMI previously reserved during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	This transaction was recorded in SG A for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	During three months ended March 31, 2016 we made an allowance of approximately $0.7 million for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	This transaction was recorded in cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded an allowance of approximately $1.2 million for slow moving inventory related to our waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	In addition, we shipped approximately $0.7 million of product to BPC during the three months ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	collectability of the sale, the revenue for this shipment was not recognized.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Both transactions were included in cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowance from BPC.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC s recent payment history and because the impact of the recent steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable balance from EMI.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	We determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on EMI s payment history.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P108_S4	Both transactions were included in SG A for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our plan.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	We expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to running our business and implementing the strategic changes summarized herein.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	Our planned capital expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2017 include approximately $1.0 million for plant and equipment costs related to manufacturing and operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	We have invested our cash in institutional funds that invest in high quality short term money market instruments to provide liquidity for operations and for capital preservation.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our cash and cash equivalent balances decreased $20.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2016, compared to an increase of $4.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	The overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 was primarily the result of a reduction in cash provided by financing activities.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	Operating Activities During the year ended March 31, 2016, we used $22.5 million in cash in our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $25.2 million and cash used for working capital of $2.4 million, offset by non cash adjustments (primarily accounts receivable allowances, warranty provision, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and inventory provision) of $5.1 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2015, operating cash usage was $23.0 million, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $31.5 million and cash used for working capital of $11.9 million, offset by non cash adjustments of $20.4 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in thousands):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Represents accounts receivable allowances, warranty provision, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense and inventory provision.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	The change in inventory was primarily the result of lower purchases during the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The change in accounts receivable was the result of lower than expected revenue and slower collection of accounts receivable compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily the result of the timing and level of inventory receipts compared to vendor payments during the year ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 million and $1.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 relates primarily to the acquisition of fixed assets.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	Financing Activities During the year ended March 31, 2016, we generated approximately $3.5 million in financing activities compared to cash generated during the year ended March 31, 2015 of approximately $29.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 were primarily the result of proceeds from the at-the-market offering program described below, offset by cash equivalents restricted by Wells Fargo, net repayments under the credit facility and the repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	As a condition of the amended Credit Agreements with Wells Fargo, $5.0 million of cash equivalents was restricted as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2015, the funds generated in financing activities were primarily from the proceeds related to our underwritten public offering described below.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Effective August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-market offering program pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	The Company will set the parameters for sales of the shares, including the number to be sold, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number that may be sold in one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	In connection with the April 2016 underwritten public offering, the Company is subject to a lock up with respect to the at-the-market offering program that expires in September 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	As of March 31, 2016, 6.9 million shares of the Company s common stock had been sold and the net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the common stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $12.7 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Effective May 6, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which it sold 0.9 million shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $34.00 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The shares were allocated to a single institutional investor.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the common stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $29.8 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	On October 31, 2013, an unsolicited exercise of warrants to purchase 4.7 million shares resulted in proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Effective October 31, 2013, all then outstanding warrants expired.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	There were no stock options exercised during the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	Employee stock purchases, net of repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units, resulted in approximately $0.1 million of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2016, compared with $0.2 million of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Credit Facility We maintain the Credit Agreements, with Wells Fargo, which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	As previously disclosed, the twelfth amendment to the Credit Agreements provided the Company the right, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity available under the Company s revolving lines of credit to an aggregate maximum of $20.0 million from an aggregate maximum of $15.0 million (the Accordion Feature ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	In addition, Wells Fargo has provided the Company with a non-revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in the Company s business.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	Effective as of June 30, 2015, the Company exercised the Accordion Feature, thereby increasing the maximum borrowing capacity available to a maximum of $20.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P123_S4	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the credit facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	One of the Credit Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	As of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, $9.5 million and $13.0 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, our capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (f) change our accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Furthermore, the Credit Agreements contain financial covenants, including (i) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (ii) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon the Company s financial performance, and (iii) limitations on our annual capital expenditures.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	Several times since entering into the Credit Agreements we were not in compliance with certain covenants under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Credit Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Credit Agreements regarding the Company s annual net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	On June 10, 2015, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance, and the Company and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	As a condition of the amended Credit Agreements, the Company has restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents effective June 10, 2015 as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	As of September 30, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with a financial covenant contained in the amended Credit Agreements regarding the Company s net income for the six months ended September 30, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	On November 2, 2015, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance and entered into an amendment to amend the financial covenants regarding net income for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	On June 7, 2016, the Company and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Credit Agreements as described above, we would not be able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Credit Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Credit Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P130_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Credit Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P130_S3	Based on our current forecasts, management believes we will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Credit Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P130_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, management would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	Although the Company realized working capital improvements during the year ended March 31, 2016 because of a reduction in finished goods inventory, the Company s working capital requirements for the year ended March 31, 2016 were higher than planned; primarily as a result of cash equivalents restricted by Wells Fargo, lower than expected revenue, slower collection of accounts receivable and lower than anticipated inventory turns.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	We continue to be negatively impacted by the softness of the global oil and gas markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and Middle East.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 were $11.7 million ($16.7 million when combined with restricted cash related to the credit facility) and $32.2 million, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, less the amount outstanding under the credit facility, was $7.2 million and $19.3 million as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	Additionally, the Company has an at-the-market offering program in place pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, subject to the lock up period discussed above.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	shares of common stock, which were offered in lieu of common stock to those purchasers whose purchase of common stock in the offering otherwise would result in the purchaser beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company s outstanding common stock following the completion of the offering.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	Also included in the offering were Series A warrants to purchase 4.1 million shares of common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	Every two shares of common stock were sold with one Series A Warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a collective negotiated price of $3.50.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S3	Every two Series B Warrants were sold with one Series A Warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a collective negotiated price of $3.48.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S4	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the common stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $13.1 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S5	The offering closed on April 22, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P133_S6	In connection with this underwritten public offering, the Company is subject to a lock up with respect to the at-the-market offering program that expires in September 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	Based on management s projections, free cash of approximately $7.2 million (cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash less amounts outstanding under the credit facility) and net proceeds of approximately $13.1 million from the April 22, 2016 underwritten public offering are sufficient to meet the Company s anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	If revenue is less than management s projections, management has the ability to reduce expenses to extend its liquidity to provide adequate resources for a similar period of time.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	In addition, management has the ability to manage certain operating assets and liabilities, specifically the procurement of inventory and timing of payments of accounts payable, capital expenditures and certain operating expenses depending on the results of its operations to preserve its cash and cash equivalents.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	If revenue declines at a greater rate than contemplated above or if management cannot reduce expenses to offset the lower revenue and extend its liquidity, the Company would need additional financing.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	Until such time as the Company can generate positive cash flows from operations, the Company likely will continue to have a need for additional capital.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	The Company may seek to raise funds by selling additional securities after the expiration of the applicable lock up period (through the at-the-market offering discussed above or some other offering) to the public or to selected investors or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S3	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S4	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P135_S5	In addition, any equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Should the Company be unable to execute its plans (including raising funds through the at-the-market offering program after the lock up period and maintaining availability under its credit facility) or obtain additional financing that may be needed, the Company may need to significantly reduce its operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	Depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	our customers ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $13.6 million and $13.1 million as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, ( DSO ), increased by 26 days to 66 days as of March 31, 2016 compared to 40 days as of March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S2	The change in DSO was largely the result of lower than expected revenue and slower collection of accounts receivable for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S3	We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S4	We recorded bad debt expense of $10.1 million and $0.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P139_S5	During Fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowances from BPC and EMI, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P140_S2	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P140_S3	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	At March 31, 2016, our commitments under notes payable, capital leases and non cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1009759_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	As of March 31, 2016, we had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $23.8 million through Fiscal 2019.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not firmly scheduled; therefore, amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable concurrent with the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	Agreements we have with some of our distributors require that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	While we have never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in product technology could result and yield costs if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P143_S2	As of March 31, 2016, no significant inventories were held at distributors.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	Pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreements with Wells Fargo, the minimum interest payable under the credit facility is $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P144_S1	One of the Credit Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	We do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P147_S1	The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P147_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P147_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact the new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P148_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is recorded using the first-in, first-out method to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P148_S2	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P148_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact the new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S1	The ASU was issued as part of FASB s current plan to simplify overly complex standards.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S2	This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S3	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this ASU.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S4	The update requires retrospective application to all prior period amounts presented.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S5	This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S6	The adoption of this standard would result in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from prepaid expenses and other current assets to the amount outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P149_S7	The net amount of such costs at March 31, 2016 was approximately $0.1 million.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P150_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P150_S2	Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	We are currently evaluating the potential impacts the new standard will have on our reporting process.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12 ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P152_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	We are evaluating the potential impacts of the new standard on our existing stock-based compensation plans.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1009759_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P155_S1	We are evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements.
1009759_16_ITEM7_P155_S2	We will be required to adopt the revenue recognition standard in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year ending March 31, 2019), and interim periods within those annual periods.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently develop products in the U.S. and market and sell our products predominantly in North America, Europe and Asia.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As all of our sales and purchases are currently made in U.S. dollars, we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the future, as our customers, employees and vendor bases expand, we may enter into transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to changes in the interest rates results primarily from our credit facility borrowings.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2016 we had $9.5 million of outstanding indebtedness subject to interest rate fluctuations.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Based on these borrowings as of March 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the then current LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $0.1 million on an annual basis.
1009759_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from period to period and therefore could result in additional interest.
1009759_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Form 10 K beginning at page F 1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 K for the year ended March 31, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2016 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms prescribed by the SEC.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Additionally, such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	KPMG LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	The report of KPMG LLP follows.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have audited Capstone Turbine Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Capstone Turbine Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P10_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P13_S0	In our opinion, Capstone Turbine Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1009759_16_ITEM9A_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended March 31, 2016, and our report dated June 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion of those consolidated financial statements.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capstone Turbine Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation (the Company ) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ( CHP ), integrated combined heat and power ( ICHP ), and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	In addition, the Company s microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company was organized in 1988 and has been commercially producing its microturbine generators since 1998.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	Management anticipates incurring additional losses until the Company can produce sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	To date, the Company has funded its activities primarily through private and public equity offerings.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10 K (this Form 10 K ) refers to the Company s fiscal years ending March 31 as its Fiscal years.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company continues to be negatively impacted by the softness of the global oil and gas markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and Middle East.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company s net loss from operations for the Fiscal years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $24.5 million, $30.9 million and $15.3 million, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	Management believes that the Company will make progress on its path to profitability by improving its net loss from operations through lowering its operating costs and the continued development of other geographical and vertical markets.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 were $11.7 million ($16.7 million when combined with restricted cash related to the line of credit (the Credit Facility )) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ) and $32.2 million, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	See Note 11 Revolving Credit Facility for discussion of the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S5	Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, less the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, was $7.2 million and $19.3 million as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S6	Although the Company realized working capital improvements during Fiscal 2016 because of a reduction in finished goods inventory, the Company s working capital requirements for Fiscal 2016 were higher than planned, primarily as a result of lower than expected revenue, slower collection of accounts receivable and lower than anticipated inventory turns.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S7	Additionally, the Company has an at-the-market offering program in place pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time after the lock up period at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S8	See Note 9 Underwritten and Registered Direct Placement of Common Stock for disclosure with respect to the at-the-market offering program.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S9	The Company completed an underwritten public offering on April 22, 2016 in which it sold shares of common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S10	See Note 15 Subsequent Events for discussion with respect to this public offering.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P63_S11	In connection with this underwritten public offering, the Company is subject to a lock up with respect to the at-the-market offering program that expires in September 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Based on management s projections, free cash of approximately $7.2 million (cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash less amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility) and net proceeds of approximately $13.1 million from the April 22, 2016 underwritten public offering are sufficient to meet the Company s anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	If revenue is less than management s projections, management has the ability to reduce expenses to extend its liquidity to provide adequate resources for a similar period of time.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	In addition, management has the ability to manage certain operating assets and liabilities, specifically the procurement of inventory and timing of payments of accounts payable, capital expenditures and certain operating expenses depending on the results of its operations to preserve its cash and cash equivalents.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	If revenue declines at a greater rate than contemplated above or if management cannot reduce expenses to offset the lower revenue and extend its liquidity, the Company would need additional financing.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Until such time as the Company can generate positive cash flows from operations, the Company likely will continue to have a need for additional capital.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms or at all.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	If the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	In addition, any equity or debt securities that the Company would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of its common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Should the Company be unable to execute its plans (including raising funds through the at-the-market offering program after the lock up period and maintaining availability under its Credit Facility) or obtain additional financing that may be needed, the Company may need to significantly reduce its operations.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	On November 6, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, effective as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the filing date.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	For purposes of presentation, all share and per share information and instruments outstanding under stock plans contained in this report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Capstone Turbine International, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in June 2004, Capstone Turbine Singapore Pte., Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in February 2011, and Capstone Turbine Financial Services, LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in October 2015, after elimination of inter-company transactions.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Reclassifications For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company has separately reported revenue and cost of goods sold for product, accessories and parts from service revenue.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Such amounts have been reported for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company considers only those investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase as cash equivalents.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revolving credit facility and notes payable approximate fair market value based on their short term nature.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements, for disclosure regarding the fair value of other financial instruments.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are typically non interest bearing.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Inventories The Company values inventories at first in first out ( FIFO ) basis and lower of cost or market.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	The composition of inventory is routinely evaluated to identify slow-moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	Included in the assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in the Company s products.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	All inventories expected to be used in more than one year are classified as long-term.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	During Fiscal 2016, we recorded an allowance of approximately $0.8 million for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	Inventory charges increased approximately $1.0 million during Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of an allowance for slow-moving inventory related to the waste heat recovery generators.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from two to ten years.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	amortized over the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method with the exception of the backlog of 100 kW microturbines ( TA100 ) acquired from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. ( CPS ).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	Purchased backlog is amortized based on unit sales and presented as a component of cost of goods sold.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	If the expected future cash flows from the use of such assets (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, the Company may be required to record a write down, which is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Company performed an analysis as of March 31, 2016 and as a result, approximately $0.1 million of purchased TA100 backlog was written off to align with management s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, trade name, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of deferred product and service revenue and customer deposits.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	Deferred revenue will be recognized when earned in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policy.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company has the right to retain all or part of customer deposits under certain conditions.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Revenue The Company s revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ( FPP ), net of discounts.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	Capstone s distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post commissioning repair and maintenance service.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company s standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post shipment performance obligations by Capstone except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Revenue from the sale of products, parts and accessories is generally recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue will not be recognized until collectability is reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P83_S3	Management s estimates regarding the collectability of a particular sale may impact the timing of actual revenue recognized each period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	Service performed by the Company has consisted primarily of time and materials based contracts.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	The time and materials contracts are usually related to out of warranty units.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company also provides maintenance service contracts to customers of its existing installed base.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	The maintenance service contracts are agreements to perform certain services to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P85_S3	Service revenue derived from maintenance service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	Warranty The Company provides for the estimated costs of warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and geography of sale.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	The Company s product warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to twenty-four months.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P86_S3	Factors that affect the Company s warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P86_S4	These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company accounts for grant distributions and development funding as offsets to R D expenses and both are recorded as the related costs are incurred.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	Total offsets to R D expenses amounted to $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $1.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the consolidated financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	Contingencies The Company records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	Risk Concentrations Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	At March 31, 2016, the majority of our cash balances were held at financial institutions located in California.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	The accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to certain limits.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	The Company determined that the collectability of this accounts receivable balance was not reasonably assured based on BPC s payment history and because the impact of the recent steep decline of the Russian ruble could continue to negatively impact its ability to pay its outstanding accounts receivable balance.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	During the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded approximately $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable balance from Electro Mecanique Industries ( EMI ), one of the Company s distributors in the Middle East and Africa.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	Diluted loss per share is also computed without consideration to potentially dilutive instruments because the Company incurred losses which would make such instruments antidilutive.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	The first performance measurement period began on April 1, 2015 and will end on March 31, 2017; the second performance measurement period has a three-year term that began on April 1, 2015 and will end on March 31, 2018.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P158_S2	Any earned PRSU awards will vest 50% after the end of the applicable performance measurement period and 50% one year thereafter.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	The weighted average per share grant date fair value of PRSUs granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $15.50.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	Based on our assessment as of March 31, 2016, the PRSU threshold for the first performance measurement likely will not be met and as a result no compensation expense was recorded or recognized during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P159_S2	Compensation expense, if any, will be recognized over the corresponding requisite service period and will be adjusted in subsequent reporting periods if the Company s assessment of the probable level of achievement of the performance goals changes.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P159_S3	The Company will continue to periodically assess the likelihood of the PRSU threshold being met until the end of the applicable performance period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	The Company issues restricted stock awards under the 2000 Plan to employees and non-employee directors.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Company granted stock awards to non-employee directors who elected to take payment of all or any part of the directors fees in stock in lieu of cash.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P161_S1	The following table outlines the restricted stock awards activity for the Company s fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	For each term of the Board of Directors (beginning on the date of an annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date immediately preceding the next annual meeting of stockholders), a non-employee director may elect to receive a stock award in lieu of all or any portion of their annual retainer or committee fee cash payment.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	The shares of stock were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	In June 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan ).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	The Purchase Plan provides for the granting of rights to purchase common stock to regular full and part-time employees or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	Under the Purchase Plan, shares of common stock will be issued upon exercise of the purchase rights.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P163_S3	Under the Purchase Plan, an aggregate of 70,000 shares may be issued pursuant to the exercise of purchase rights.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P163_S4	The Purchase Plan will continue by its terms through June 30, 2020, unless terminated sooner.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	The maximum amount that an employee can contribute during a purchase right period is $25,000 or 15% of the employee s regular compensation.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P164_S1	Under the Purchase Plan, the exercise price of a purchase right is 95% of the fair market value of such shares on the last day of the purchase right period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P164_S2	The fair market value of the stock is its closing price as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the day in question.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company issued a total of 5,658 shares, 1,031 shares and 615 shares of stock, respectively, to regular full and part-time employees or officers of the Company who elected to participate in the Purchase Plan.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	As of March 31, 2016, there were 14,820 shares available for future grant under the Purchase Plan.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	As of March 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding 148,229 non-qualified common stock options and 2,343 restricted stock units issued outside of the 2000 Plan.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P166_S1	The Company granted 12,500 of these stock options during Fiscal 2015, 142,500 of these stock options prior to Fiscal 2015 and 2,343 of these restricted stock units during Fiscal 2015 as inducement grants to new officers and employees of the Company, with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	Although the options and restricted stock units were not granted under the 2000 Plan, they are governed by terms and conditions identical to those under the 2000 Plan.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	options will be vested on the first day of the 48th month after the grant date.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P168_S1	All outstanding options have a contractual term of ten years.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P168_S2	The restricted stock units vest in equal installments over a period of four years.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 (the Amendment ) to the Rights Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2005, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of July 3, 2008, Amendment No. 2, dated as of June 9, 2011, Amendment No. 3, dated as of July 1, 2014 and Amendment No. 4, dated as of August 5, 2014, (the Original Rights Agreement ) between the Company and Computershare Inc.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Amendment accelerated the expiration of the Company s preferred share purchase rights (the Original Rights ) from 5:00 p.m., California time, on the 30 day after the Company s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders to 5:00 p.m., California time, on May 6, 2016, and had the effect of terminating the Original Rights Agreement on that date.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P170_S1	At the time of the termination of the Original Rights Agreement, all of the Original Rights distributed to holders of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Original Rights Agreement expired.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into a rights agreement (the NOL Rights Agreement ) with Computershare Inc., as rights agent.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	In connection with the NOL Rights Agreement, the Company s Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (a New Right ) for each share of the Company s common stock authorized and outstanding.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P171_S2	Each New Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price of $8.76 per unit, subject to adjustment.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P171_S3	The description and terms of the New Rights are set forth in the NOL Rights Agreement.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	The purpose of the NOL Rights Agreement is to diminish the risk that the Company s ability to use its net operating losses and certain other tax assets (collectively, Tax Benefits ) to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of the Company s experiencing an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	A company generally experiences such an ownership change if the percentage of its stock owned by its 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	The NOL Rights Agreement is designed to reduce the likelihood that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99% shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99% shareholder from acquiring additional shares of the Company s stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	The New Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day after a public announcement or filing that a person has, or group of affiliated or associated persons or persons acting in concert have, become an Acquiring Person, which is defined as a person or group of affiliated or associated persons or persons acting in concert who, at any time after the date of the NOL Rights Agreement, have acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions or (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day after the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being called the Distribution Date ).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	Certain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying common stock or are reportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of shares of common stock equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative position, to the extent actual shares of the common stock are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	provided that the extension is submitted to the Company s stockholders for ratification at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company succeeding such extension; (ii) the time at which the New Rights are redeemed pursuant to the NOL Rights Agreement; (iii) the time at which the New Rights are exchanged pursuant to the NOL Rights Agreement; (iv) the time at which the New Rights are terminated upon the occurrence of certain transactions; (v) the close of business on the first day after the Company s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if approval by the stockholders of the Company of the NOL Rights Agreement has not been obtained on or prior to the close of business on the first day after the Company s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders; (vi) the close of business on the effective date of the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if the Board of Directors determines that the NOL Rights Agreement is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of Tax Benefits; and (vii) the close of business on the first day of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board of Directors determines that no Tax Benefits are available to be carried forward.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	Each share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a preferential per share quarterly dividend payment equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 per share or (ii) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P177_S1	Each share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock will entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P177_S2	In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of common stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per one share of common stock.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	Effective August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-market offering program pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P178_S1	The Company will set the parameters for sales of the shares, including the number to be sold, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number that may be sold in one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	In connection with the April 2016 underwritten public offering, the Company is subject to a lock up with respect to the at-the-market offering program that expires in September 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	As of March 31, 2016, 6.9 million shares of the Company s common stock were sold pursuant to the at-the-market offering program and the net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the common stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $12.7 million.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	Effective May 6, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which it sold 0.9 million shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $34.00 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	The shares were allocated to a single institutional investor.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Common Stock, after deducting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $29.8 million.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	On October 31, 2013, an unsolicited exercise of warrants to purchase 4.7 million shares resulted in proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P181_S1	Effective October 31, 2013, all then outstanding warrants expired.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The FASB has established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P182_S3	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	The asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2015 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	Cash equivalents includes cash held in money market and U.S. Treasury Funds at March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	The table below presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during Fiscal 2015 and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1009759_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	The carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P192_S1	As the Company s obligations under the Credit Facility are based on adjustable market interest rates, the Company has determined that the carrying value approximates the fair value.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P192_S2	The carrying values and estimated fair values of these obligations are as follows (in thousands):
1009759_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company calculated the estimated fair value of warrants on the date of issuance and at each subsequent reporting date using the following assumptions:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company has issued common stock warrants at times in the past and recently issued common stock warrants in its April 2016 underwritten public offering; however, no warrants were outstanding as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P194_S1	The Company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements and does not enter into derivative agreements for the purpose of hedging risks.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company maintains two Credit and Security Agreements, as amended (the Credit Agreements ), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), which provide the Company with a line of credit of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P195_S1	As previously disclosed, the twelfth amendment to the Credit Agreements provided the Company the right, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity available under the Company s revolving lines of credit to an aggregate maximum of $20.0 million from an aggregate maximum of $15.0 million (the Accordion Feature ).
1009759_16_ITEM15_P195_S2	In addition, Wells Fargo has provided the Company with a non revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in the Company s business.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P195_S3	Effective as of June 30, 2015, the Company exercised the Accordion Feature, thereby increasing the maximum borrowing capacity available to a maximum of $20.0 million.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P195_S4	The amount actually available to the Company may be less and may vary from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of its eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	As security for the payment and performance of the Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of the assets of the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P196_S1	One of the Credit Agreements will terminate in accordance with its terms on September 1, 2017 and the other one will terminate on September 30, 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	The Credit Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo s consent, including covenants that limit the Company s ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, the Company s capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company s assets, (f) change the Company s accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	Agreements contain financial covenants, including (i) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (ii) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum cash balance relative to the outstanding line of credit advances, which was $8.1 million as of March 31, 2016, and (iii) limitations on the Company s annual capital expenditures.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Credit Agreements also define an event of default to include a material adverse effect on the Company s business, as determined by Wells Fargo.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P198_S2	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	Several times since entering into the Credit Agreements the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, the Company amended the Credit Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P199_S2	The following summarizes the recent events, amendments and waivers:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with the financial covenant contained in the amended Credit Agreements regarding the Company s annual net income for Fiscal 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	On June 10, 2015, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance, and the Company and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P200_S2	As a condition of the amended Credit Agreements, the Company has restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents effective June 10, 2015 as additional security for the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	As of September 30, 2015, the Company determined that it was not in compliance with a financial covenant contained in the amended Credit Agreements regarding the Company s net income for six months ended September 30, 2015.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P201_S1	On November 2, 2015, the Company received from Wells Fargo a waiver of such noncompliance and entered into an amendment to amend the financial covenants regarding net income for the remainder of Fiscal 2016.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	On June 7, 2016, the Company and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreements which set the financial covenants for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	If the Company had not obtained the waivers and amended the Credit Agreements as described above, the Company would not have been able to draw additional funds under the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	In addition, the Company has pledged its accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for its Credit Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if the Company were in default under the Credit Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P203_S2	Wells Fargo also has the option to terminate the Credit Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P203_S3	Based on the Company s current forecasts, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Credit Agreements for at least the next twelve months.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P203_S4	If a covenant violation were to occur, the Company would attempt to negotiate a waiver of compliance from Wells Fargo.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P204_S0	The Company is required to maintain a Wells Fargo collection account for cash receipts on all of its accounts receivable.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P204_S1	These amounts are immediately applied to reduce the outstanding amount on the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	The floating rate for line of credit advances is the sum of daily three month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ), which interest rate shall change whenever daily three month LIBOR changes, plus applicable margin.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P205_S1	Based on the revolving nature of the Company s borrowings and payments, the Company classifies all outstanding amounts as current liabilities.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P205_S2	The applicable margin varies based on net income and the minimum interest floor is set at $66,000 each calendar quarter.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P205_S3	The Company s borrowing rate was 4.4% and 4.0% at March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company is also required to pay an annual unused line fee of one quarter of one percent of the daily average of the maximum line amount and 1.5% interest with respect to each letter of credit issued by Wells Fargo.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P206_S1	These amounts, if any, are also recorded as interest expense by the Company.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P206_S2	As of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, $9.5 million and $13.0 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the Credit Facility.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	2016, approximately $9.0 million was available for additional borrowing.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P207_S1	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $0.5 million, which includes $0.2 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P207_S2	Interest expense related to the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2015 was $0.7 million, which includes $0.2 million in amortization of deferred financing costs.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P208_S0	As of March 31, 2016, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventories of approximately $23.8 million through Fiscal 2019.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P208_S1	Certain inventory delivery dates and related payments are not scheduled; therefore amounts under these firm purchase commitments will be payable upon the receipt of the related inventories.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company leases offices and manufacturing facilities under various non cancelable operating leases expiring at various times through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P209_S1	All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P209_S2	The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and renewal options for five year periods.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P209_S3	Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1009759_16_ITEM15_P209_S4	The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1009759_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	The Grooms Complaint makes allegations and claims that are substantially identical to those in the Kinney Complaint, and both complaints seek compensatory damages of an undisclosed amount.

Sec. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1009759_16_ITEM15_P317_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Capstone Turbine Corporation ( Capstone , We or the Company ) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power ( CHP ), integrated combined heat and power ( ICHP ), and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Microturbines allow customers to produce power on site in parallel with the electric grid or stand-alone when no utility grid is available.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Several technologies are used to provide on site power generation (also called distributed generation ) such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind turbine systems and fuel cells.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	With our stand alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	Together with our distributors, we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan ( FPP ).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	We offer microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts ( kW ) to one megawatt ( MW ) in electric power output.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our microturbines combine patented air bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	Because of our air bearing technology, our microturbines do not require lube oil or coolant.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common reciprocating engines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, butane, diesel and biodiesel.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating is used.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We sell complete microturbine units, components and various accessories.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide aftermarket parts and services.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs ).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide service, application engineering and installation support.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	Distributors also provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post commissioning service, including a comprehensive FPP.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our distributors perform as independent value added resellers.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	OEMs integrate our products into their own product solutions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10 K (this Form 10 K ) refers to our fiscal years ending March 31 as its Fiscal years.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our 30 kW ( C30 ) microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The 65 kW ( C65 ) microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100 room hotel while also providing about one third of its electrical requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	Our 200 kW ( C200 ) microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) sized container, we have created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine ( C60 ), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P10_S4	The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our C1000 Series product was developed based on our C200 microturbine engine.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO sized container.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled our C1000 Signature ( C1000S ) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW ( C800S ) or 600kW ( C600S ) microturbine.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We began shipping the C200 and C1000 Signature Series ICHP solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	They operate on the same principle as a jet engine using a variety of commercially available fuels.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit ( BTU ) gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our microturbine s multi fuel capability provides competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our microturbines incorporate four major design features: advanced combustion technology, patented air bearing technology, digital power electronics and proprietary remote monitoring systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our advanced combustion technology allows our microturbines to achieve low emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our natural gas fueled C65 and C200 microturbines were certified by the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a central power plant.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our C65 and C200 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified by the CARB as meeting its 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The patented air bearing system allows the microturbine s single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum based lubrication.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Air bearings use a high pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The digital power electronics manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine; our electronic controls manage the microturbine s speed, temperature and fuel flow and communication with external networks and building management systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The digital power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for standalone mode.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	All control functions are performed digitally.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Performance is optimized, resulting in low emissions, high reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software ( CRMS ) allows end users to operate and manage the microturbine remotely.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our electronic controls manage microturbines using our proprietary software and advanced algorithms.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine, convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications, and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our products can operate connected to the electric utility grid as a current source, on a standalone basis as a voltage source, multipacked to support larger loads as a virtual single unit and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We were the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification and ATEX certification for operation in hazardous area oil and gas applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series grid connect and stand-alone microturbines are listed by Underwriters Laboratories ( UL ) as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our C30 and C60 microturbines are certified by the California Energy Commission and were the first products to comply with the requirements of its Rule 21 grid interconnection standard.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site by site and utility by utility analysis.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which allows our microturbines to be connected to New York s electric utility grid.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, integrated heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual mode operations, power servers for large multipack installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting, backflow dampers and installation hardware.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Stationary power generation applications can vary greatly depending on load size and demand location.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	From small 2 kW back-up generators to several large 1,000 MW central generating facilities, stationary power systems can offer superior fuel efficiency for the customer while also meeting strict emissions regulations.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Historically, power generation in developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	However, a number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have helped to broaden the range of power supply options available to interested parties.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our full line of microturbine energy solutions target multiple vertical markets worldwide, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Within these vertical markets, we focus on applications that we believe have the greatest near term potential for the customer based on various different factors such as energy load demand, available fuels, economic payback and for some, government incentives.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	We also target smaller sub segments that fall within these vertical markets that may not otherwise be considered for on-site generation.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy which we believe provides a significant economic advantage to our customers while reducing their onsite emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	When compared to onsite boilers, microturbines generally produce fewer commonly found air pollutants ( criteria pollutants ), such as nitrogen oxides ( NOx ), carbon monoxide ( CO ) and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	In fact, our CHP or CCHP system can displace local boiler emissions altogether.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	A high efficiency CHP or CCHP system can allow for reduced net utility costs for end users as well as improved fuel consumption.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The most common uses for captured thermal energy include space heating and air conditioning, water heating and water chilling, direct-drying and steam for industrial applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	In CCHP applications, the microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, which produces the chilled water necessary for air conditioning and local use.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Organizations of all sizes have used the heat generated by our microturbines at the many different types of commercial and industrial applications they serve, including hotels and resorts, hospitals and medical centers, as well as office buildings and large retail facilities.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	We offer fully integrated microturbine-powered CHP and CCHP solutions for installation in one of three modes: stand-alone, back-up and dual-mode.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Each dual-mode microturbine can operate as a microgrid with the ability to run with or independent of a traditional grid or utility.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The use of microgrids to serve local loads helps to reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the microgrid.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end-users by lowering their overall cost to operate and by providing a versatile technology that is fuel flexible and scalable enough to fit a wide variety of applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies on a global scale.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural waste operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, and in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	Our microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	We introduced our C65 and C200 stand-alone digester products to the renewable energy market segment in 2007 and 2013, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	With these products, we are able to target many different types of renewable energy applications, including biogas producing facilities in third world countries and in remote locations that offer a valuable fuel source for the generation of electricity.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	The performance of our C65 digester gas system has been routinely evaluated to ensure that the combustion system is stable from 0 to 100 percent power output.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Minor controls changes have been implemented to increase stability at low power levels.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	The ability to convert this low British Thermal Unit ( BTU ) fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including oil and gas exploration, production, and at compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of power.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated onsite.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally burned or released into the atmosphere.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts, flare gas or associated gas, into a useable fuel to provide power to these sites.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	In 2010, we sold our first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market at locations in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	The addressable market for our microturbines in this industry is significant.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce the emission of hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	We have participated in several Natural Gas STAR workshops in the United States and foreign markets to demonstrate the emissions reductions its technology can provide.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	The C30, C65 and C200 microturbines can be configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the natural resources market.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the often corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Oil and gas customers often prefer power generation systems that offer low maintenance and high reliability in order to ensure continued production.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of system failure, momentary or otherwise, certain high demand power users, including high technology, health care and information systems facilities require higher levels of reliability in their power generation service.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies ( UPS ) to protect critical loads from power disturbances along with back-up diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We offer an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have developed the world s only microturbine-powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and back-up diesel generators.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We offer two UL listed microturbine powered UPS solutions: our UPSource microturbine powered solution, which provides a source for prime or emergency power; as well as our Hybrid UPS microturbine-powered solution, which provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Both critical power supply products offer eight nines of availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent back-up source.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	This measurement of availability is used in the data center industry to refer to 99.999999% of reliability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	These integrated solutions are ideal for new facility construction or expansion and can be installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency levels while reducing operating costs, compared with traditional solutions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Dual-mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150 percent overload for up to 10 seconds during transient conditions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Dual-mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	These systems offer high on-site energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water, or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	This configuration, when combined with our Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S4	Our microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line interactive continuous power solution.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P52_S5	In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our technology also can be used in hybrid electric vehicle ( HEV ) applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our customers have applied our products in HEV applications such as transit buses and Class 7 and 8 work trucks.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	In these applications, the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	The benefits of microturbine-powered HEV hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation and reduced emissions when compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs, which and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our technology can also be used in marine applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht market segments.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	The most feasible application for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary generator set.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	Another feasible application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board battery charger and range extender.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	Our marine customers use both liquid fueled and natural gas microturbine products.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary products: low emissions with no exhaust aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	We primarily sell and market our microturbine product, parts and service through our global network of authorized distributors and OEMs.

1009759_17_ITEM1_P70_S4	Additionally, E-Finity, DTC and Reliable Secure Power Systems ( RSP ), one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 29%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P70_S5	DTC, Optimal, RSP, and Regale Energy Zrt, our Hungarian distributor ( Regale ), accounted for 28%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	We recorded bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million during each of Fiscal 2017 and 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	During Fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowances from BPC Engineering ( BPC ), one of our Russian distributors and Electro Mecanique Industries ( EMI ), one of our distributors in the Middle East and Africa, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Often power purchased from the electric utility grid can be less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P75_S3	Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, our management believes we offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc. (which recently entered into a joint venture with Eaton), GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, and Tecogen, Inc. (which now includes American DG Energy Inc.), among others.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc. (a division of Piller Power Systems Inc.), Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Overall, we compete with end users other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine s ability to:
1009759_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S3	This could make our systems less economical, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S6	However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S7	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of climate change.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P86_S8	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	We continue to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of our low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies or improvements to existing technologies.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	Competing new technologies have historically received larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) has encouraged collaboration by U.S. small businesses with national lab researchers through the Small Business Vouchers pilot program.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	We are one of 114 American small businesses participating in this program, which provides assistance in identifying national lab research and development activities that align with our interests.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Federal Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) for certain clean energy technologies, including CHP, microturbines and fuel cells among others, expired at the end of calendar year 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	As a result, we may see an impact on our sales in the United States due to the loss of this 10% tax credit.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	energy technology-providers will face the same financial hurdle and the loss of the ITC would level the playing field with fuel cell technologies, which had received a 30% ITC.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	U.S. Government export promotion activities help support exports of American products to foreign markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	We participate in one of the U.S. Department of Commerce export promotion activities, Single Company Promotions, which helps us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications that require longer lead time.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S3	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S4	We have an ongoing program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts wherever possible.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S5	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S6	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S7	We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S8	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and use lean manufacturing processes.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S9	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S10	Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P93_S11	Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize production line down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules on build or a linear basis.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ( Solar ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	We are required to pay a per unit royalty fee over a seventeen-year period for cores manufactured and sold by us using the technology.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P94_S3	Royalties of approximately $32,100 and $35,000 were earned by Solar for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	In 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement ( Development Agreement ) with Carrier Corporation ( Carrier ) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of our C200 microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	Carrier earned $0.9 million and $1.2 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which will continue until the obsolescence of the C200 microturbine product line.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	We have a combined total of approximately 102,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	We assemble and test units our C30 and C65 microturbines at our facility in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S3	We are in the process of consolidating our manufacturing processes into our Van Nuys location.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S4	We believe that once this is complete we will have a production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S5	We believe we will be able to support this production capacity level by adding additional shifts which would increase working capital requirements and making some additional capital expenditures.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P96_S6	Additionally, once the consolidation is complete we will be looking to sublet all or a portion of our facility in Chatsworth.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	We have historically devoted substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	More recently, due to our cost reduction efforts, our focus is on expanding the existing products, including the launch of our C1000 Signature Series microturbine in December 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, R D expenses were $5.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 7% and 12% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	R D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost sharing programs, such as DOE grants.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	There were no benefits from cost-sharing programs for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P98_S3	Benefits from cost sharing programs were $0.2 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand alone basis.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	During Fiscal 2017, we continued to make progress with our product development roadmap despite a 47% reduction in our R D expenses compared to Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	Our product development activities during Fiscal 2017 included new-patented fuel injector and certification of our C65 microturbine to applicable European Union medium voltage grid interconnection standards.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	In addition, we continued our development in our C200S ICHP microturbine and overall cost reduction for our new Signature Series.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	We developed a new-patented multi-staged lean pre-vaporizing, pre-mixing fuel injector providing ultra-low emissions that meet EPA Tier 4 requirements for power generation.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	Under this new program, exhaust emissions from these engines will be required to decrease by more than 90%.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became Verband der Elektrotechnik ( VDE ) and Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft ( BDEW ) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano ( CEI ) certified during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	These new standards were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	The C200S microturbine incorporates numerous system and design upgrades intended to improve overall product quality, reliability, and performance.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	Our new C200S ICHP product further supports our effort to diversify our business into the CHP and CCHP energy efficiency markets, and the new roof mounted integrated CHP heat recovery modules designed specifically for our new Signature Series product we aim to add additional revenue opportunities.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	We developed new partnerships with the DOE in Fiscal 2017, whereby, the DOE will provide funding in the amount of $335,000 for one year to Argonne National Laboratory to conduct hydrogen and synthetic fuel or syngas testing on our C65 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	The new fuel injection technology could enable our microturbines to run on an expanded range of fuels that are not currently widely used, but have the potential to be a source of power generation with widely varying compositions, such as gasified industrial waste streams.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P104_S2	In addition, we continued progress on our flexible fuels program, with recent successful testing on butane.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	We partnered with FGC Plasma Solutions to test a new plasma-assisted fuel injection technology in our C65 microturbine.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	We work together to develop a new combustion concept for improved turbine efficiency and emissions performance.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P105_S2	The technology will enable more optimum operation of the engine as well as benefits from lower emissions, increased fuel flexibility and improved reliability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P105_S3	Testing will be held at Argonne National Laboratory.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled our C1000 Signature ( C1000S ) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW ( C800S ) or 600kW ( C600S ) microturbine.

1009759_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	Because of our single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P111_S2	Although we believe the hybrid electric bus and truck market has the potential to be a beneficial option for the bus and truck manufacturers, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P111_S3	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	We are working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine based hybrid solution.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P112_S2	The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is retrofitted with a refrigerated box body and should be ready for track testing at Kenworth facilities in the second half of 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P112_S3	The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the San Joaquin Valley in California.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P112_S4	We expect to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	A prototype or concept vehicle may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines ( HDDE ).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P115_S1	Our compressed natural gas ( CNG ) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On Road HDDE for Urban Bus.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P115_S2	Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Our marine products may be used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, hotel power, CHP, or CCHP.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P116_S1	They may be ideal for small and mid-size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas ( ECAs ).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P116_S2	Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P116_S3	We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.

1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S2	In March 2013, we successfully completed proof of concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S3	This allowed us to proceed with high pressure spool development which was completed during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S4	We also demonstrated an increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S5	We intend to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S6	The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P121_S7	The final phase of the program will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits end users through lower operating costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat resistant steel alloys used in our microturbines at a significantly reduced cost.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P122_S1	In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, know how , and trademark laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 98 U.S. and 27 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_17_ITEM1_P123_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between 2017 and 2035.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P123_S3	We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	We believe that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	We were organized in 1988 in the State of California, our company was reincorporated as Capstone Turbine Corporation on June 22, 2000 in the State of Delaware.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	As of March 31, 2017, we had 168 full-time employees.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P126_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
1009759_17_ITEM1_P126_S2	We consider relations with our employees to be moderate to good after the Fiscal 2017 reductions in force.

1009759_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We assume no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the filing of this Form 10-K to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as may be required by law.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-K because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.

1009759_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few repeat end use customers and limited repeat business compared to our competitors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of capital markets when we seek to raise additional capital could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On June 2, 2017, we entered into two secured credit facilities (the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements ) with Western Alliance Bank through its Bridge Bank division ( Bridge Bank ), with credit support provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States through its working capital guarantee program.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Under the terms of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we may borrow up to $12.0 million on a revolving basis depending on, among other factors, the amount of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are for a two-year period ending June 2, 2019.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Total borrowings, letter of credit obligations and the then aggregate committed amount of cash management services under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements will bear per annum interest at the prime rate plus 1.5 percent, subject to increase during the occurrence of an event of default.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Obligations under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are secured by all of our assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Bridge Bank s consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, or (d) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The financial covenants of the domestic credit agreement with Bridge Bank (the Domestic Facility ) requires us not to exceed specified levels of losses relative to our financial model and the outstanding line of credit advances may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Domestic Facility also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to operate at current levels.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and as of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $850.9 million.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	On March 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.7 million, and working capital of $14.2 million.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	This compares to $827.0 million, $16.7 million and $18.1 million, respectively, on March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility and not available to us.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business strategy is focused on profitability-oriented initiatives such as reducing operating expenses, diversifying and increasing revenue, improving gross margin and utilizing our joint venture, Capstone Energy Finance to provide financing options for the purchase of Capstone microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We may not be able to execute the business strategy successfully and if we are unable to generate positive cash flow, potential customers may choose not to purchase our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Moreover, the business strategy is based upon projections, which are in turn based upon estimates and assumptions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the projections, estimates and assumptions which underlie the business strategy or as to our ability to execute the business strategy successfully.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to increase sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue to operate at our current levels on a longer-term basis.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer-term basis.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue to operate at current levels.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain our credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue to operate at current levels, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Impairment charges on our long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders equity.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, as part of our business strategy, we are focusing our marketing efforts on the oil and gas, renewable energy and combined heat and power markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may be unable to grow our business in these target markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have limited production slots for our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any delays in production will increase our costs, reduce future production slots and could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We also outsource certain of our components internationally.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	For example, during Fiscal 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash warranty provision of approximately $5.2 million to proactively retrofit select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance and reliability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	This could enhance our competitors abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our competitors include several well known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Because of greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis vis our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle, and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, which can result in the typical delays associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Net product orders for Fiscal 2017 were $43.8 million and contributed to an ending backlog of $113.0 million at March 31, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The book-to-bill ratio was 1.1:1 for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	However, because our backlog represents only the estimated amount of future product revenue to be recognized under negotiated contracts as shipments convert backlog to recognized revenue for accounting purposes, we may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog, and our backlog may not be indicative of future revenues.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S5	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P55_S6	As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	During the second quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we removed approximately $51.6 million, for 186 units, representing 63.8 megawatts, of backlog from BPC Engineering, one of our Russian distributors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	This removal aligned the backlog to our management s expectations based on the global macroeconomic environment during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, such as the volatility of the global oil and gas market, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and on-going geopolitical tensions involving Russia.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, we removed a portion of our TA100 backlog of approximately $2.4 million, for 17 units representing 1.7 megawatts, from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	This removal aligned our TA100 backlog with our management s decision to limit future production of TA100 systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our business and financial performance depends in part on the oil and natural gas industry, and a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in late 2014 caused a reduction in our customers' spending and associated drilling and completion activities, which had an adverse effect on our revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	If prices were to decline further, similar declines in our customers' spending would have an adverse effect on our revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We derived approximately 11% and 2% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting certain oil and gas production related business activities with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies and requiring export licenses for certain of such activities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government could be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our business may be impacted by international instability , war, terrorism, and geopolitical events.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	International political and economic instability or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or other business operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	A slowdown in economic growth in some emerging markets could result in long sales cycles, greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets, could have an adverse effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers and manufacturing vendors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenue from these relationships.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S4	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S5	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S6	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P70_S7	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $17.0 million and $13.6 million as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ( DSO ) at the end of Fiscal 2017 was 68 days, compared with 66 days at the end of Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	We recorded bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million during each of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	E-Finity and Horizon accounted for approximately 14% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Additionally, E-Finity, DTC and RSP, accounted for 29%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The loss of E-Finity, Horizon or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S4	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Non compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P83_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on site generation.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P88_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	During the second quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we removed approximately $51.6 million, for 186 units, representing 63.8 megawatts, of backlog from BPC Engineering, one of our Russian distributors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	This removal aligned the backlog to our management s expectations based on the global macroeconomic environment during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, such as the volatility of the global oil and gas market, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and on-going geopolitical tensions involving Russia.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, we removed a portion of our TA100 backlog of approximately $2.4 million, for 17 units representing 1.7 megawatts, from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	This removal aligned our TA100 backlog with our management s decision to limit future production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Potential intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	From time to time, we may face litigation relating to intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder and other matters.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Whether or not resolved in a manner adverse to us, any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Further, our insurance coverage is limited for these and other claims against us, and we may not have adequate insurance or financial resources to pay for our liabilities or losses from any such claims.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P93_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by risks related to cyber security threats.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P95_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, the services we provide to customers, the competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation or our stock price.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P97_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We may acquire other businesses in the future and the success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P101_S3	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P105_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P105_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P107_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our internal control systems rely on employees trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Loss of these employees or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P110_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S1	This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S3	We may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S4	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P112_S5	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We and certain of our current and former officers are named as defendants in a shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Additionally, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in various state and federal derivative suits.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S2	We may be named as defendants in future lawsuits.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S3	These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time, attention and resources.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S4	Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P114_S5	In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P115_S2	See Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	If we continue to fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S2	On December 12, 2016, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S3	In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 12, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S4	On June 13, 2017 we were afforded an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S5	In order to regain compliance, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, at which time Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department would provide written confirmation of our compliance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P117_S6	We may need to implement a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P118_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P120_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	further decreases in or continued low levels of oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P122_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P122_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P123_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P125_S0	In March 2016, we received a letter from an owner of shares of our common stock giving notice of such stockholder s intention to nominate nine director candidates for election to our board of directors at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P125_S1	We sent a response letter to the stockholder indicating that its notice letter was deficient because it did not meet the requirements prescribed under our bylaws.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P125_S2	A proxy contest involving the stockholder or litigation regarding the stockholder s eligibility to nominate director candidates at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders ultimately did not ensue, however, we could become engaged in a proxy contest with another activist stockholder in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P126_S0	A proxy contest and any related litigation would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by management, our board of directors and employees, and would divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P126_S2	We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors, management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P126_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above or the outcome of a proxy contest or any related litigation.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Similarly, a future proxy contest with any other activist investor could result in the turnover of a majority of our board of directors.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P127_S1	If such a change in the composition of our board of directors were to occur, it could trigger the change of control provisions of certain agreements and arrangements to which we are a party, including the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, our Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, between us and Darren Jamison, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, a change of control constitutes an event of default that would entitle Bridge Bank to, among other remedies, declare all of our outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements immediately due and payable.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P129_S0	occurrence of a qualifying termination of Mr. Jamison or certain of our other executive officers and employees, we will be obligated to make specified severance payments to the terminated employee.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P130_S0	If such a change in our board composition were to occur, and if our board of directors were unable to take certain mitigating action to avoid triggering, or if we were unable to obtain a waiver of, these and other similar change of control provisions to which we are subject, the resulting payments and other obligations required of us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our NOL rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P132_S1	These provisions include our board s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P134_S0	On May 6, 2016, we and Computershare Inc., as Rights Agent, entered into a Rights Agreement (the NOL Rights Agreement ) designed to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of us experiencing an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P134_S1	While this NOL Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our net operating losses, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from becoming 4.99% stockholders.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P134_S2	The NOL Rights Agreement could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P135_S0	The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Concerns over global stability and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have contributed to the extreme volatility of the markets which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Future issuances of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P138_S1	The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P138_S2	In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P139_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P140_S0	The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P141_S0	analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P141_S1	If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We do not intend to pay cash dividends.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P142_S1	We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P142_S2	Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P143_S1	As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.
1009759_17_ITEM1A_P143_S2	Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 98,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly and test space located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	This lease expires in September 2019, and we have one five year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease an approximately 79,000 square foot facility at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California as an engineering test and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	On June 7, 2017 we entered into an amendment to extend the Van Nuys facility lease agreement.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	This lease will expire in February 2023 and we have one five year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	We are in the process of consolidating our manufacturing processes into our Van Nuys location.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S6	Once this is complete we will be looking to sublet all or a portion of our facility in Chatsworth.
1009759_17_ITEM2_P0_S7	Management believes our facilities are adequate for our current needs.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	Two putative securities class action complaints were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the following captions: David Kinney, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-08914 on November 16, 2015 (the Kinney Complaint ) and Kevin M. Grooms, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-09155 on December 18, 2015 (the Grooms Complaint ).
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	The putative class in the Kinney Complaint is comprised of all purchasers of the Company s securities between November 7, 2013 and November 5, 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Kinney Complaint alleges material misrepresentations and omissions in public statements regarding BPC and the likelihood that BPC would not be able to fulfill many legal and financial obligations to the Company.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Kinney Complaint also alleges that the Company s financial statements were not appropriately adjusted in light of this situation and were not maintained in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company lacked adequate internal controls over accounting.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Kinney Complaint alleges that these public statements and accounting irregularities constituted violations by all named defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by the individual defendants.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S4	The Grooms Complaint makes allegations and claims that are substantially identical to those in the Kinney Complaint, and both complaints seek compensatory damages of an undisclosed amount.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S5	On January 16, 2016, several shareholders filed motions to consolidate the Kinney and Grooms actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S6	On February 29, 2016, the Court granted the motions to consolidate, and appointed a lead plaintiff.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S7	On May 6, 2016, a Consolidated Amended Complaint with allegations and claims substantially identical to those of the Kinney Complaint was filed in the consolidated action.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S8	The putative class period in the Consolidated Amended Complaint is June 12, 2014 to November 5, 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P1_S9	Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint on June 17, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	2017, the Court issued an order granting Defendants motion to dismiss in its entirety with leave to amend.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 28, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	Defendants motion to dismiss was filed June 2, 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Company has not recorded any liability as of March 31, 2017 since any potential loss is not probable or reasonably estimable given the preliminary nature of the proceedings.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	On February 18, 2016, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in the State of California against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors under the following caption: Stesiak v. Jamison, et al., No. BC610782.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	The lawsuit alleges that certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors knew or should have known that BPC would be unable to fulfill its obligations to the Company, but allowed the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding BPC and the Company s financial condition.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S2	The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to timely adjust the Company s account receivables and backlog to reflect BPC s inability to pay the Company.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S3	The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S4	It demands damages for the amount of damage sustained by the Company as a result of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, that the Company institute corporate governance reforms, and disgorgement from the individual defendants.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S5	On May 5, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking to stay this action until such time as the defendants motion(s) to dismiss the federal securities class action are either granted with prejudice or denied in whole or in part.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S6	On May 10, 2016, the Court entered that proposed order.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S7	Given that the federal securities class action was dismissed with leave to amend, this case is still stayed.
1009759_17_ITEM3_P3_S8	A status conference is scheduled for September 20, 2017.

1009759_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (combined heat and power ( CHP ) and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We continue to execute on our three-pronged business profitability plan to reduce operating expenses; diversify and increase revenue; and improve gross margin.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	During Fiscal 2017 our net loss decreased by 5% to $23.9 million and our basic and diluted loss per share improved by 46% to $0.75 compared to $25.2 and $1.39, respectively, in the same period of the previous year.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	The improvement in the net loss during Fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of a reduction of operating expenses of approximately 30% from Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	The improvement in the net loss per share during Fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in weighted average shares outstanding to 32.1 million for Fiscal 2017 from 18.2 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	Our accessories, parts and service revenue increased 8% to a record high of $28.9 million or 37% of total revenue compared to $26.8 million or 31% of total revenue in Fiscal 2016 as global microturbine installations and factory protection plan revenue continued to expand.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S5	During Fiscal 2017, our revenue from the Russian market was approximately 11% of revenue compared to 2% of revenue the same period last year as we continue to rebuild our business in the Russian market by adding additional distributors in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P4_S6	Our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our products continue to gain interest in all six of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The renewable energy market is fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and cow, pig and chicken manure.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our product sales in the oil and gas and other natural resources market is driven by our microturbines reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, however, we have refocused our business strategy to target projects within the energy efficiency and renewal energy markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	The actual shift to the energy efficiency market is reflected in the product shipment by vertical markets table on page 38.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	We have also seen increased interest in critical power supply applications as customers want solutions that can handle both primary and backup power.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	In addition, management closely monitors operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	revenue growth, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation products and marine), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, we have refocused our business strategy to target projects within the energy efficiency and renewable energy markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following table summarizes our product shipments by vertical markets:
1009759_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy to provide a significant economic advantage to customers while reducing their onsite emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Compared with more traditional, independent generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including oil and gas exploration, production, and at compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of power.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated onsite.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally burned or released into the atmosphere.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts - flare gas, or associated gas, into a useable fuel to provide prime power to these sites.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies happening on a global scale.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural waste operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, and in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of system failure, momentary or otherwise, certain high demand power users, including high technology, health care and information systems facilities require higher levels of reliability in their power generation service.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize UPS to protect critical loads from power disturbances along with back-up diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	We offer an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our technology also can be used in HEV applications.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our customers have applied our products in HEV applications such as transit buses and Class 7 and 8 work trucks.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	In these applications, the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	The benefits of microturbine-powered HEV hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability when compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs, which and may reduce overall engine efficiency.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht market segments.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The most feasible application for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary engine.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, thereby reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Another feasible application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net product orders were $43.8 million and $53.9 million for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Ending backlog was $113.0 million at March 31, 2017 compared to $109.6 at March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Book-to-bill ratio was 1.1:1 and 1.0:1 for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Additionally, the timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Sales and Distribution Channels We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	derived from sales to distributors who resell our products to end users.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	We have 92 distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	In the United States and Canada, we currently have 23 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	Outside of the United States and Canada, we currently have 69 distributors and OEMs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	We continue to refine our distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Service We provide service primarily through our global distribution network.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Together with our global distribution network we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	We provide factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our FPP backlog at the end of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 was $77.1 million and $66.5 million, respectively, which represents the value of the contractual agreement for FPP services that has not been earned and extends through Fiscal 2031.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Additionally, we offer new and remanufactured parts through our global distribution network.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Service revenue in Fiscal 2017 was approximately 18% of total revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Product Robustness and Life Cycle Maintenance Costs We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance cost to our customers.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We expect that our existing product platforms, the C30, C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	More recently, due to our cost reduction efforts, our focus is on expanding the existing products, including the launch of our C1000 Signature Series microturbine in December 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our product development activities during Fiscal 2017 included new-patented fuel injector and certification of our C65 microturbine to applicable European Union medium voltage grid interconnection standards.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, we continued our development in our C200S ICHP microturbine and overall cost reduction for our Signature Series.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	We developed a new-patented multi-staged lean pre-vaporizing, pre-mixing fuel injector providing ultra-low emissions that meet EPA Tier 4 requirements for power generation.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Under this new program, exhaust emissions from these engines will be required to decrease by more than 90%.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became VDE, BDEW and CEI certified during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P33_S5	These new standards were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The C200S microturbine incorporates numerous system and design upgrades intended to improve overall product quality, reliability, and performance.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our new C200S ICHP product further supports our effort to diversify our business into the CHP and CCHP energy efficiency markets, and the new roof mounted integrated CHP heat recovery modules designed specifically for our Signature Series product we aim to add additional revenue opportunities.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We are also developing a more efficient microturbine CHP system with the support of the DOE, which awarded us a grant of $5.0 million in support of this development program, of which $4.2 million was allocated to us and was used through September 30, 2015.

1009759_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing to the best value supply chain option.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We believe that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone s promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions and product mix, pricing and performance, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we generate $25 million in quarterly revenue with a 25% gross margin.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We are in the process of consolidating our manufacturing processes into our Van Nuys location.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	We believe that once this is complete we will have a production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	We believe we will be able to support this production capacity level by adding additional shifts, which would increase working capital requirements, and making some additional capital expenditures.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to long lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets and fixed assets, bad debts, inventories, warranty obligations, stock based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	The estimated fair value of the assets is determined using the best information available.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	We performed an analysis as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 and as a result, approximately $17,000 and $0.1 million of purchased TA100 backlog was written off to align with management s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	See Note 5 Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our inventories are valued on a first in first out ( FIFO ) basis and at the lower of cost or market.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write downs are required.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write downs of inventories.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S5	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S6	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P49_S7	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Our distributors purchase products, parts and FPPs for sale to end users and are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including application engineering, installation, commissioning and post commissioning service.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically non interest bearing.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days past payment terms.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the amount of net deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The use of Black Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon our actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents our best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Risk free interest rate We used the yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The amount of stock based compensation cost is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and established an accounting policy election to assume zero forfeiture for awards and account for forfeitures when they occur.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue by geographic markets (amounts in millions):
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2017 decreased $8.0 million, or 9%, to $77.2 million from $85.2 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 included decreases in revenue of $6.4 million from the Latin American market, $6.3 million from the Asian and Australian markets and $3.2 million from the United States and Canadian markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	These overall decreases in revenue were offset by increases in revenue of $6.6 million from the European and Russian markets and $1.3 million from the Middle East and African markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	The decrease in revenue in the Latin American market during Fiscal 2017 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily the result of a strong U.S. dollar and reduced capital and operational spending, particularly in the upstream and midstream sectors of the oil and gas markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	The decrease in revenue in the Asian and Australian markets was primarily the result of large non-recurring microturbine product shipments for specific projects that had occurred during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P66_S5	The decrease in revenue in the United States and Canadian markets during Fiscal 2017 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily the result of the continued volatility in the global oil and gas market.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	in revenue in the European and Russian markets during Fiscal 2017 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily because of our strategic initiative to improve the diversification of our revenue, the improvement of sales from BPC and additional revenue from new distributors in the Russian market.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in revenue in the Middle East and African markets during Fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the previous year was primarily the result of our continued investment in key growth initiatives in those markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Despite the increase in revenue in the Russian, Middle East and African markets, our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	For Fiscal 2017, revenue from microturbine products decreased $10.1 million, or 17%, to $48.3 million from $58.4 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	Megawatts shipped during Fiscal 2017 decreased 10.7 megawatts, or 18%, to 49.3 megawatts from 60.0 megawatts during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	The decrease in revenue and megawatts shipped was because of delays of certain oil and gas projects, globally, resulting from the continued volatility in the oil and gas market.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Average revenue per megawatt shipped was approximately $1.0 million during each of Fiscal 2017 and 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	For Fiscal 2017, revenue from our accessories and parts increased $0.3 million, or 2%, to $15.0 million from $14.7 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in revenue from accessories and parts was primarily because of an increase in sales of accessories.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we shipped ten of our new roof mounted integrated CHP heat recovery modules designed for our C1000 Signature Series systems, which added approximately $0.4 million of new accessories revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Service revenue for Fiscal 2017 increased $1.8 million, or 15%, to $13.9 million from $12.1 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in service revenue was primarily the result of our growing installed base and an increase in our energy efficiency customers purchasing our FPP service agreements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ( E-Finity), one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 14% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ( Horizon ), one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 11% and 15% of our revenue for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	Sales to Dtc Soluciones Inmobiliarias S.A. de C.V. ( DTC ), one of our Mexican distributors, accounted for 10% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	Sales to Optimal Group Australia Pty Ltd ( Optimal ), one of our Australian distributors, accounted for 10% of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The gross margin was $1.8 million, or 2% of revenue, for Fiscal 2017 compared to a gross margin of $12.8 million, or 15% of revenue, for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	The decrease in gross margin of $11.0 million, compared to Fiscal 2016 was primarily because of incremental warranty expense of $6.9 million, lower volume of microturbines shipped and a shift in product mix of $6.0 million, offset by decreases in production labor and overhead expense of $0.9 million, inventory charges of $0.7 million and royalty expense of $0.3 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	manufacturing overhead and fixed and direct material costs and improving product performance as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	The increase in warranty expense of $6.9 million during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 was primarily because of a one-time non-cash warranty provision to retrofit proactively select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance, reliability and customer satisfaction.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition, warranty expense during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 reflects accommodations and timing of claims in the current period and the result of a benefit in the same period last year related to the decrease in the number of units covered under warranty.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	Management expects warranty expense in Fiscal 2018 to be lower than in Fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a decrease in reliability repair programs.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased $0.9 million during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 as a result of decreases in salaries expense of $1.0 million, $0.2 million of business travel expense, and $0.1 million of consulting expense.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	These decreases were primarily the result of our cost reduction program to lower labor and overhead expenses throughout the organization.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	These decreases were offset by an increase in manufacturing supplies expense of $0.4 million during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily because of the closeout of purchasing agreements resulting from changes in product configuration and engineering changes.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Inventory charges decreased $0.7 million during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily as the result of a decrease in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	During Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we made an allowance of approximately $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Royalty expense decreased $0.3 million during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of our C1000 Series systems.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following table summarizes our gross margin (in millions except percentages):
1009759_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Product gross margin decreased to a negative 14% during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily because of a one-time non-cash warranty provision, a decrease in product shipments and a shift in product mix.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Accessories, parts and service gross margin increased to 30% during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 primarily because of our growing installed base, increase in energy efficiency customers purchasing our FPP service agreements and timing of FPP services performed.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Research and Development Expenses ( R D ) R D expenses for Fiscal 2017 decreased $4.8 million, or 47%, to $5.4 million from $10.2 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The overall decrease in R D expenses of approximately $4.8 million resulted from decreases in salaries expense of approximately $2.5 million, supplies expense of $1.7 million, consulting expense of $0.7 million and business travel expense of $0.1 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	reduction in cost-sharing benefits of $0.2 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	As part of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses and achieve profitability, during Fiscal 2016, we reduced the number of active research projects, which included the development of the C250 microturbine.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2018 to be lower than in Fiscal 2017 as a result of the continued cost reduction initiatives.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses SG A expenses for Fiscal 2017 decreased $6.4 million, or 24%, to $20.7 million from $27.1 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The net decrease in SG A expenses was comprised of decreases of approximately $3.5 million in salaries expense, $0.9 million in marketing expense, $0.8 million in professional services expense, including accounting expenses, $0.5 million in business travel expense, $0.5 million in facilities expense and $0.4 million in consulting expense.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	These overall decreases were offset by an increase in supplies expense of $0.2 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	These decreases were primarily the result of our cost reduction program to lower operating expenses throughout the organization.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	Excluding bad debt recovery, management expects SG A expenses in Fiscal 2018 to be lower than in Fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of our continued initiatives to reduce operating expenses and achieve profitability.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $0.1 million, or 17%, to $0.5 million during Fiscal 2017 from $0.6 million for Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Interest expense is primarily from the average balances outstanding under our former credit facility with Wells Fargo.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	As of March 31, 2017, we had total debt of $11.5 million outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $1,000, or 5%, to $19,000 during Fiscal 2017 from $20,000 during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Income tax expense incurred was related to state and foreign taxes.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The effective income tax rate of 0.1% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 35% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	At March 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $678 million and $160.2 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $269.3 million at March 31, 2017 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	Similarly, at March 31, 2016, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	This information was prepared in accordance with GAAP, and, in the opinion of management, contains all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere herein.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our operating results for any prior quarters may not necessarily indicate the results for any future periods.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $0.2 million in bad debt recovery with respect to the collection of cash for receivables from BPC previously reserved during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	During the three months ended March 31, 2017 we made an allowance of approximately $0.5 million in cost of goods sold for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded approximately $1.4 million in bad debt recovery in SG A with respect to the collection of cash for receivables from EMI previously reserved during Fiscal 2015.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	During the three months ended March 31, 2016 we made an allowance of approximately $0.7 million in cost of goods sold for slow-moving inventory in relation to our TA100 product line.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our plan.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	We expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to running our business and implementing the strategic changes summarized herein.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Our planned capital expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2018 include approximately $1.0 million for plant and equipment costs related to manufacturing and operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	We have invested our cash in institutional funds that invest in high quality short term money market instruments to provide liquidity for operations and for capital preservation.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances increased $3.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to a decrease of $15.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	The overall improvement in cash used during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants and underwritten public offerings as described below.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Operating Activities During the year ended March 31, 2017, we used $18.5 million in cash in our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $23.9 million and cash used for working capital of $3.4 million, offset by non cash adjustments (primarily warranty provision, accounts receivable allowances, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and inventory provision) of $8.8 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2016, we used $22.5 million in cash in our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $25.2 million and cash used for working capital of $2.4 million, offset by non cash adjustments of $5.1 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in thousands):
1009759_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Represents warranty provision, change in fair value of warrant liability, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, inventory provision and accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	The change in non-cash operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily the result of a warranty provision to retrofit proactively select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance, reliability and customer satisfaction.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	In addition, non-cash operating activities includes the change in fair value of warrant liability for certain warrants issued in our October 2016 Offering (defined below) of common stock and warrants.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	The change in accounts receivable was the result of lower revenue and slower collection of accounts receivable during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S3	The change in inventory was primarily the result of a decrease in raw materials and finished goods during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period the previous year.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S4	The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily the result of the level of inventory receipts and timing of payments made by us during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period the previous year.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P97_S5	The change in other operating assets and liabilities was primarily because of warranty payments for the proactive retrofit of certain non-Signature Series C200 microturbines during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $0.2 million and $1.5 million during the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 relates primarily to the acquisition of fixed assets.

1009759_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2017 were primarily the result of proceeds from the October 2016 Offering of common stock and warrants described below, the April 2016 Offering (defined below), and proceeds from the credit facility, offset by repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	The funds generated from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 were primarily the result of proceeds from the at-the-market offering program described below, offset by net repayments under the credit facility and the repayment of notes payable and capital lease obligations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	On October 18, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 3,600,000 shares of common stock, pre-funded Series B warrants to purchase up to 2,700,000 shares of common stock ( the October 2016 Offering ), and Series A warrants to purchase up to 6,300,000 shares of common stock.

1009759_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Effective August 28, 2015, we entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-market offering program pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	We will set the parameters for sales of the shares, including the number to be sold, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number that may be sold in one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we issued 0.4 million shares of our common stock under the at-the-market offering program and the net proceeds to us from the sale of our common stock were approximately $0.3 million after deducting commissions paid of approximately $8,800.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	As of March 31, 2017, 7.3 million shares of our common stock were sold pursuant to the at-the-market offering program and the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common stock were approximately $12.8 million after deducting commissions paid of approximately $0.4 million.

1009759_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Employee stock purchases, net of repurchases of shares of our common stock for employee taxes due on vesting of restricted stock units, resulted in approximately $16,000 of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2017, compared with $0.1 million of net cash used during the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	We maintained two Credit Agreements, with Wells Fargo, which provided us with a line of credit of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate (the Credit Agreements ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The twelfth amendment to the Credit Agreements provided us the right, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity available under our revolving lines of credit to an aggregate maximum of $20.0 million from an aggregate maximum of $15.0 million (the Accordion Feature ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	In addition, Wells Fargo provided us with a non-revolving capital expenditure line of credit up to $0.5 million to acquire additional eligible equipment for use in our business.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S3	Effective as of June 30, 2015, we exercised the Accordion Feature, thereby increasing the maximum borrowing capacity available to a maximum of $20.0 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S4	The amount actually available to us varied from time to time depending on, among other factors, the amount of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S5	As security for the payment and performance of the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of Wells Fargo in substantially all of our assets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P106_S6	As of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, $11.5 million and $9.5 million in borrowings were outstanding, respectively, under the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Credit Agreements included affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Wells Fargo s consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, (d) pay dividends on, or purchase, acquire, redeem or retire shares of, our capital stock, (e) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (f) change our accounting method or (g) enter into a different line of business.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	Furthermore, the Credit Agreements contained financial covenants, including (i) a requirement not to exceed specified levels of losses, (ii) a requirement to maintain a substantial minimum monthly cash balance to outstanding line of credit advances based upon our financial performance, and (iii) limitations on our annual capital expenditures.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Several times since entering into the Credit Agreements we were not in compliance with certain covenants under the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	In connection with each event of noncompliance, Wells Fargo waived the event of default and, on several occasions, we amended the Credit Agreements in response to the default and waiver.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	On June 10, 2015, we received from Wells Fargo a waiver of one such event of noncompliance, and as a condition of the amended Credit Agreements, we had restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S3	If we had not obtained the waivers and amended the Credit Agreements, we would not have been able to draw additional funds under the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S4	In addition, we pledged our accounts receivables, inventories, equipment, patents and other assets as collateral for our Credit Agreements, which would be subject to seizure by Wells Fargo if we were in default under the Credit Agreements and unable to repay the indebtedness.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S5	Wells Fargo also had the option to terminate the Credit Agreements or accelerate the indebtedness during a period of noncompliance.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S6	On February 7, 2017, we and Wells Fargo entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreements regarding the release of restricted cash and the exclusion of certain items from the financial covenant calculations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S7	As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the amended Credit Agreements for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P108_S8	Upon closing with Bridge Bank, our existing credit facilities with Wells Fargo were paid off in full.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	New Credit Facility On June 2, 2017, we entered into two secured credit facilities (the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements ) with Western Alliance Bank through its Bridge Bank division ( Bridge Bank ), with credit support provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States through its working capital guarantee program.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	Under the terms of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we may borrow up to $12.0 million on a revolving basis depending on, among other factors, the amount of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are for a two-year period ending June 2, 2019.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Total borrowings, letter of credit obligations and the then aggregate committed amount of cash management services under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements will bear per annum interest at the prime rate plus 1.5 percent, subject to increase during the occurrence of an event of default.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Obligations under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are secured by all of our assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Bridge Bank s consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, or (d) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	The financial covenants of the domestic credit agreement with Bridge Bank (the Domestic Facility ) requires us not to exceed specified levels of losses relative to our financial model and the outstanding line of credit advances may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	The Domestic Facility also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Working Capital Cash used in working capital was $3.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $1.0 million from the $2.4 million cash used during the year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	inventory and accounts payable payments made by us.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Additionally, we didn t fully achieve our planned number of product shipments during the year ended March 31, 2017, resulting in lower than expected revenue primarily in the oil and gas markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Based on our current operating plan, we anticipates that, given current working capital levels, current financial projections, the ability to borrow under our credit facility with Bridge Bank and the funds raised by selling additional securities through the at-the-market offering as of the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2017 financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	We believe we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2017 financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	We believe we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2017 financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Evaluation of Ability to Maintain Current Level of Operations In connection with preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they became due for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2017 financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Management assessed that there were such conditions and events, including a history of recurring operating losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, the continued negative impact by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and Middle East.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	Our working capital requirements during Fiscal 2017 were higher than planned, primarily as a result of warranty claims related to the proactive retrofit for non-Signature Series C200 microturbines.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S3	Additionally, we did not fully achieve our planned number of product shipments during Fiscal 2017, resulting in lower than expected revenue.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S4	We incurred a net loss of $23.9 million and used cash in operating activities of $18.5 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P118_S5	In addition, at March 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.7 million, and outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $11.5 million.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	Management evaluated these conditions in relation to our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	Our ability to continue current operations and to execute on management s plan is dependent on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	Management believes that we will continue to make progress on our path to profitability by continuing to lower our operating costs and to develop our geographical and vertical markets.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	We may seek to raise funds by selling additional securities (through the at-the-market offering or otherwise) to the public or to selected investors or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S4	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms or at all.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S5	If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P119_S6	In addition, any equity or debt securities that we would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Based on our current operating plan, management anticipates that, given current working capital levels, current financial projections, the ability to borrow under our new credit facility and the funds raised by selling additional securities through the at-the-market offering as of the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2017 financial statements, we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of its Fiscal 2017 financial statements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	Depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	our customers ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $17.0 million and $13.6 million as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, ( DSO ), increased by two days to 68 days as of March 31, 2017 compared to 66 days as of March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P123_S2	We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million for each of the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P123_S3	During Fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowances from BPC and EMI, respectively.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P124_S3	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	We do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P126_S2	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18 ), which amends guidance and presentation related to restricted cash in the statement of cash flows, including stating that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included within cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	We adopted ASU 2016-18 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and retrospectively applied ASU 2016-18 as required.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Prior to the adopting ASU No. 2016-18, our consolidated statements of cash flows reported changes in restricted cash as financing activities and excluded restricted cash from the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	The effect on prior periods of adopting the new guidance includes: (i) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance as of March 31, 2016 to $16.7 million and (ii) increase of $5.0 million in cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P128_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported on the consolidated balance sheets that sum to amounts reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	ASU 2016-09 changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees and involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S2	Specifically, ASU 2016-09 requires that all income tax effects of share-based awards be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the reporting period in which they occur.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S3	Additionally, ASU 2016-09 amends existing guidance to allow forfeitures of share-based awards to be recognized as they occur.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S4	Previous guidance required that share-based compensation expense include an estimate of forfeitures.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P129_S5	We have elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 as of April 1, 2016 and made a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	As of March 31, 2016, the Company had $11.2 million of unrealized excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.
1009759_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 the Company recognized these tax benefits as a credit to retained earnings and a debit to the deferred tax asset.

1009759_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Historically, power generation in developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	However, a number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have helped to broaden the range of power supply options available to interested parties.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our full line of microturbine energy solutions target multiple vertical markets worldwide, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, microgrid and transportation.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Within these vertical markets, we focus on applications that we believe have the greatest near term potential for the customer based on various different factors such as energy load demand, available fuels, economic payback and for some, government incentives.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	We also target smaller sub segments that fall within these vertical markets that may not otherwise be considered for on-site generation.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy which we believe provides a significant economic advantage to our customers while reducing their onsite emissions.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Compared with more traditional, independent generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	When compared to onsite boilers, microturbines generally produce fewer commonly found air pollutants ( criteria pollutants ), such as nitrogen oxides ( NOx ), carbon monoxide ( CO ) and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	In fact, our CHP or CCHP system can displace local boiler emissions altogether.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	A high efficiency CHP or CCHP system can allow for reduced net utility costs for end users as well as improved fuel consumption.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The most common uses for captured thermal energy include space heating and air conditioning, water heating and water chilling, direct-drying and steam for industrial applications.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	In CCHP applications, the microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, which produces the chilled water necessary for air conditioning and local use.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Organizations of all sizes have used the heat generated by our microturbines at the many different types of commercial and industrial applications they serve, including hotels and resorts, hospitals and medical centers, as well as office buildings and large retail facilities.

1009759_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the Assignment Agreement ) and Promissory Note (the Note ) with Turbine International, LLC ( TI ).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC Engineering, our former Russian distributor ( BPC ), upon TI s payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	As of March 31, 2018, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the Guarantor ), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI s obligations under the Agreement and Note.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the Amended Assignment Agreement ) and the Note (the Amended Note ) with TI.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI s payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	We recorded bad debt recoveries of approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million during Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	As of March 31, 2015, we had an amount owed to us of approximately $8.1 million by BPC.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	As of March 31, 2018, we collected cumulatively approximately $1.8 million from BPC on their accounts receivable allowance.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	Additionally, we collected approximately $1.0 million from TI, under the terms of the Assignment Agreement.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P81_S4	The remaining balance is $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The market for our products is highly competitive.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Often power purchased from the electric utility grid can be less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P85_S3	Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, our management believes we offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc. (which recently entered into a joint venture with Eaton), GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, and Tecogen, Inc. (which now includes American DG Energy Inc.), among others.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	and benefit from above market contracts provided by state mandates.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems is that they may not be dispatchable because of their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid or high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Although the market is still developing, a number of fuel cell providers are also focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc. (a division of Piller Power Systems Inc.), Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, historically have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines would provide a better value to end users in most applications.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	Overall, we compete with end users other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine s ability to:
1009759_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S3	This could make our systems less economical, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S4	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P97_S5	These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of climate change.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P98_S2	Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission particularly on burning coal and fuel oil and fuel efficiency standards as long as gas combustion technology solutions are not excluded.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies or improvements to existing technologies.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	We continue to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of our low emission and energy efficient products.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Competing new technologies have historically received larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	However, the U.S. Department of Energy is funding research to explore the role CHP could play as a flexible resource to provide additional generating capacity when the grid demands increase and/or to provide other services, such as frequency regulation for stabilization.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	As more intermittent renewable resources are added to the electric grid, grid operators need access to additional dispatchable generation capacity to ensure an adequate and stable power supply.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	Capstone s new PowerSync controller could provide this automated response capability to allow for participation in grid services markets, where permitted.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	In the United States, the Federal Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) for certain clean energy technologies, including CHP, microturbines and fuel cells among others, expired at the end of calendar year 2016.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	In February 2018, this tax credit was extended to 2022 and made retroactive for 2017 at its previous 10% level.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act extended and modified bonus depreciation to allow businesses to immediately deduct 100% of eligible property placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S3	The deduction limit will phase down from 100% to 0% by 2027.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S4	As a result, we may see a positive impact on our sales in the United States due to the renewal of this 10% tax credit and extension and modification of bonus depreciation.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P102_S5	However, other CHP and gas-powered distributed energy technology-providers will also benefit from the return of these tax incentives, and, in the case of fuel cell technologies, who will see a return to a 30% ITC level with a phase down to 22% by 2022 and expiration in 2023, could see an even greater benefit from this renewal than our systems.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications that require longer lead time.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S4	However, single source suppliers with long lead times may be more challenging to transition to another supplier.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S5	We have an ongoing program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts wherever possible, however this has been challenging with low production volumes and increased pricing.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S6	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S7	We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S8	During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we received notification from one of our single source suppliers that they were at maximum capacity and would require prepayment and a significant increase in the price of multiple components in order to fulfill our supply requirements for Fiscal 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S9	Due to their capacity issues, it is uncertain if we will experience an interruption in parts from this supplier or be able to fully offset or recover any resulting component price increases.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P103_S10	This could impact margins or sales in future quarters.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and use lean manufacturing processes.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P104_S2	Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P104_S3	Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing global geopolitical tensions.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	minimize production line down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules on build or a linear basis.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	Solar Turbines Incorporated ( Solar ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	and we began manufacturing them in June 2001.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	We are required to pay a per unit royalty fee over a seventeen-year period for cores manufactured and sold by us using the technology.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P106_S3	Royalties of approximately $30,900 and $32,100 were earned by Solar for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	In 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement ( Development Agreement ) with Carrier Corporation ( Carrier ) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of our C200 microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P107_S1	Carrier earned $0.9 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, which will continue until the obsolescence of the C200 microturbine product line.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we consolidated our operations and offices into our Van Nuys location in Southern California.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P108_S1	We have approximately 42,300 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P108_S2	We believe that our production capacity goal of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix is well above our current production rates and will be achievable by adding additional shifts.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P108_S3	This may require an increase in working capital and some additional capital expenditures when necessary.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	We have historically devoted substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	More recently, due to our cost reduction efforts, our focus is on expanding the existing products, including the launch of our C1000 Signature Series microturbine in December 2015.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P109_S2	We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, R D expenses were $4.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 5% and 7% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our R D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand-alone basis.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	Our product development activities during Fiscal 2018 included the completion of the new family of PowerSync controllers used for Capstone microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	We also improved our C65 heat recovery module and launched a new cleanable severe environment air filtration system for our line of microturbine products.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P112_S2	In addition, our product development activities during Fiscal 2018 included research in the certification for our C200S microturbine by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) to the latest UL 1741 interconnection standards that became effective in 2016.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	Phoenix Contact and Capstone in a joint effort improved on-site controls and integration with end-use customer facilities.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	The main objectives of developing the new PowerSync controller line were to further increase system reliability, availability and make Capstone microturbines easier to use for both end-user customers as well as Capstone distribution partners.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S2	The new controller line is based on Phoenix Contact s AXC 3050 PLC, and further increases the reliability and availability of the Capstone microturbines by utilizing a self-healing Ethernet ring topology to eliminate single points of failure in its control network.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S3	The new controllers also provide seamless transfer capabilities, ensuring the end-users critical loads do not experience any interruption to their operation in the event of a utility power outage.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S4	The new PowerSync controllers include algorithms to maximize overall system efficiency and adjust the operation of individual microturbines to align with their predicted scheduled service dates.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P113_S5	The PowerSync controllers are intuitive, easy to use, provide for secure remote communications, and can be customized to integrate with site-specific balance-of-plant equipment.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	Capstone s new HRM features a 6% efficiency improvement over the original HRM technology and will allow us to capture even more accessory business globally, especially in Europe.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	Our new cleanable severe environment air filtration system for our line of microturbine products was launched during Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	During sand and dust storms common to most hot arid desert areas, particulate concentrations close to the ground can reach levels 20,000 times those in typical U.S. cities.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P116_S1	Such dust and dirt loads can cripple conventional air filtration systems, cause massive maintenance expenditures and allow excessive dust concentrations to be ingested by the turbine.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Capstone s new cleanable severe environment units employ industry standard high-efficiency filters.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P117_S1	They are a scaled down version of the filters used in much larger industrial and aero-derivative gas turbines and allow operation for prolonged time periods in desert environments like the Middle East.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	Our product development activities during Fiscal 2017 included new-patented fuel injector and certification of our C65 microturbine to applicable European Union medium voltage grid interconnection standards.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P118_S1	In addition, we continued our development in our C200S ICHP microturbine and overall cost reduction for our new Signature Series.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	We developed a new-patented multi-staged lean pre-vaporizing, pre-mixing fuel injector providing ultra-low emissions that meet EPA Tier 4 requirements for power generation.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P119_S1	Under this new program, exhaust emissions from these engines will be required to decrease by more than 90%.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became Verband der Elektrotechnik ( VDE ) and Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft ( BDEW ) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano ( CEI ) certified during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P120_S1	These new standards were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P121_S0	The C200S microturbine incorporates numerous system and design upgrades intended to improve overall product quality, reliability, and performance.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P121_S1	Our new C200S ICHP product further supports our effort to diversify our business into the CHP and CCHP energy efficiency markets, and the new roof mounted integrated CHP heat recovery modules designed specifically for our new Signature Series product we aim to add additional revenue opportunities.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	Our partnership with the DOE provided funding during Fiscal 2017 in the amount of $335,000 for one year to Argonne National Laboratory to conduct hydrogen and synthetic fuel or syngas testing on our C65 and C200 microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P122_S1	The new fuel injection technology could enable our microturbines to run on an expanded range of fuels that are not currently widely used, but have the potential to be a source of power generation with widely varying compositions, such as gasified industrial waste streams.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P122_S2	In addition, we continued progress on our flexible fuels program, with recent successful testing on butane.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P122_S3	As a result of this new fuel development program, we sold our first butane-fueled unit.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P122_S4	The butane-fueled unit was a C600S system that shipped to a small village in West Africa during Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	We partnered with FGC Plasma Solutions to test a new plasma-assisted fuel injection technology in our C65 microturbine.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P123_S1	We work together to develop a new combustion concept for improved turbine efficiency and emissions performance.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P123_S2	The technology will enable more optimum operation of the engine as well as benefits from lower emissions, increased fuel flexibility and improved reliability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P123_S3	Testing will be held at Argonne National Laboratory.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	In addition, we continue to work both cost reduction and performance enhancement activities to improve the value of our microturbine products for our customer base.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P125_S1	Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency, thereby reducing our customers total cost of ownership.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	Because of our single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	We are working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S1	This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine based hybrid solution.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S2	The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is retrofitted with a refrigerated box body, and the microturbine operates on CNG.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S3	Initial high speed testing was completed in October, 2017 at the PACCAR Technical Center track in Mount Vernon, WA, and emissions and fuel economy testing completed at UC Riverside earlier this year.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S4	The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the Los Angeles area in California.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P128_S5	We expect to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	A prototype or concept vehicle such as this may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	Our liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines ( HDDE ).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P131_S1	Our compressed natural gas ( CNG ) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On Road HDDE for Urban Bus.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P131_S2	Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	Our marine products have been used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, hotel power, CHP, or CCHP.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	They may be ideal for small and mid-size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas ( ECAs ).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P132_S2	Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P132_S3	We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	Our C65 Hybrid UPS product line has been evolving over the years.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University s data center labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, our C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has recent installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, California and our own data center in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P133_S2	The product utilizes our inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer s critical load.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P134_S1	Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P134_S2	This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through our multipack feature.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P134_S3	These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P134_S4	Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, our low emissions Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year-round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	Although we believe the industrial UPS market has the potential to be a beneficial option for businesses that require constant supply of reliable energy, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C65 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	We are working with the DOE on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery and advanced Alumina Forming Austenitic ( AFA ) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	The High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P136_S2	In March 2013, we successfully completed proof of concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced 270 kW as part of the first phase of development.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	with high pressure spool development which was completed during Fiscal 2016.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P137_S1	We also demonstrated an increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P137_S2	We intend to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P137_S3	The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P137_S4	The final phase of the program will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits end users through lower operating costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat resistant steel alloys used in our microturbines at a significantly reduced cost.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P138_S1	In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P138_S2	In Fiscal 2018, we completed the second phase of long term endurance test.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, know how , and trademark laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P139_S1	In this regard, we have obtained 90 U.S. and 22 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions).
1009759_18_ITEM1_P139_S2	The patents we have obtained will expire between calendar years 2018 and 2035.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P139_S3	We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	We believe that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	We were organized in 1988 in the State of California.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P141_S1	Our company was reincorporated as Capstone Turbine Corporation on June 22, 2000 in the State of Delaware.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	As of March 31, 2018, we had 151 full-time employees and no part time employees.
1009759_18_ITEM1_P142_S1	No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.

1009759_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operating history is characterized by net losses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business is such that we have relatively few repeat end use customers and limited repeat business compared to our competitors.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The state of capital markets when we seek to raise additional capital could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On June 2, 2017, we entered into two secured credit facilities (the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements ) with Western Alliance Bank through its Bridge Bank division ( Bridge Bank ), with credit support provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States through its working capital guarantee program.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Under the terms of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we may borrow up to $12.0 million on a revolving basis depending on, among other factors, the amount of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are for a two-year period ending June 2, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Total borrowings, letter of credit obligations and the then aggregate committed amount of cash management services under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements will bear per annum interest at the prime rate plus 1.5 percent, subject to increase during the occurrence of an event of default.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Obligations under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are secured by all of our assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On June 1, 2018, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement ) with Bridge Bank.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Letter Agreement extended the maturity date under the Company s Bridge Bank Credit Agreements from June 2, 2019 to June 2, 2021.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Letter Agreement increased the line of credit to an amount up to $15.0 million from $12.0 million.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Additionally, the Letter Agreement reduced the per annum interest from prime rate plus 1.50 percent to 1.0 percent; the facility fee from 0.625% to 0.5%; and the cash collateral held at Bridge Bank from 42% to 40%, which is $6.0 million of the $15.0 million facility, as well as no fee for early termination.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Bridge Bank s consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, or (d) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The financial covenants of the domestic credit agreement with Bridge Bank (the Domestic Facility ) requires us not to exceed specified levels of losses relative to our financial model and the outstanding line of credit advances may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Domestic Facility also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	or any other reason, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to operate at current levels.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and as of March 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $862.2 million.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	On March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.4 million, and working capital of $21.7 million.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This compares to $852.2 million, $19.7 million and $17.1 million, respectively, on March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility and not available to us.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business strategy is focused on profitability-oriented initiatives such as reducing operating expenses, diversifying and increasing revenue, improving gross margin and utilizing our joint venture, Capstone Energy Finance to provide financing options for the purchase of Capstone microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may not be able to execute the business strategy successfully and if we are unable to generate positive cash flow, potential customers may choose not to purchase our products or utilize our program.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Moreover, the business strategy is based upon projections, which are in turn based upon estimates and assumptions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the projections, estimates and assumptions which underlie the business strategy or as to our ability to execute the business strategy successfully.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Should we be unable to execute our plans to increase sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue to operate at our current levels on a longer-term basis.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer-term basis.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue to operate at current levels.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain our credit facility.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue to operate at current levels, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Impairment charges on our long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset group with its carrying value.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders equity.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, as part of our business strategy, we are focusing our marketing efforts on the energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power, microgrid and transportation markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We may be unable to grow our business in these target markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	decrease in domestic and international incentives.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We have limited production slots for our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any delays in production will increase our costs, reduce future production slots and could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We also outsource certain of our components internationally.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we received notification from one of our single source suppliers that they were at maximum capacity and would require prepayment and a significant increase in the price of multiple components in order to fulfill our supply requirements for Fiscal 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Due to their capacity issues, it is uncertain if we will experience an interruption in parts from this supplier or be able to fully offset or recover any resulting component price increases.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	This could impact margins or sales in future quarters.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The cost of metals has historically fluctuated.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Although we experience revenue growth in fiscal 2018, our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing global geopolitical tensions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We sell our products with warranties.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	For example, during Fiscal 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash warranty provision of approximately $5.2 million to proactively retrofit select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance and reliability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	This could enhance our competitors abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our competitors include several well known companies with histories of providing power solutions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Because of greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis vis our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle, and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, which can result in the typical delays associated with large capital expenditures.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Net product orders for Fiscal 2018 were $42.3 million and contributed to an ending backlog of $97.3 million at March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The book-to-bill ratio was 1.0:1 for Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	However, because our backlog represents only the estimated amount of future product revenue to be recognized under negotiated contracts as shipments convert backlog to recognized revenue for accounting purposes, we may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog, and our backlog may not be indicative of future revenues.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P60_S6	As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the Assignment Agreement ) and Promissory Note (the Note ) with Turbine International, LLC ( TI ).
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC Engineering, our former Russian distributor ( BPC ), upon TI s payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the Guarantor ), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI s obligations under the Agreement and Note.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the Amended Assignment Agreement ) and the Note (the Amended Note ) with TI.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI s payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Due to the above amendments, we removed from product backlog orders related to BPC for approximately $7.2 million.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	This removal was the result of product pricing that we no longer would honor.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	After removal of the foregoing orders, the remaining backlog related to BPC as of March 31, 2018 comprises up to approximately 42% of our total backlog.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	This remaining backlog related to BPC continues to be reviewed with TI and the other new distributors in the region, and they have the right to request delivery of those backlog orders if the associated projects proceed.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Nonetheless the remaining backlog related to BPC may be negatively impacted.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P69_S4	If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our business and financial performance depends in part on the oil and natural gas industry, and a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in late 2014 caused a reduction in our customers' spending and associated drilling and completion activities, which had an adverse effect on our revenue for multiple years.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Although we have experienced an improvement in revenue during Fiscal 2018 due to a rebound in oil prices, we continue to be impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	If prices were to decline again, we would expect to see similar declines in our customers' spending which would have an adverse effect on our revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In addition, a worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers' liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	As a result, our products may require redesign.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We derived approximately 3% and 11% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting certain oil and gas production related business activities with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies and requiring export licenses for certain of such activities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government could be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import, or may otherwise adversely impact our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The current U.S. administration has voiced strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and may decide to impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include China and other countries from which we import components or raw materials.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Any such duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Others are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A "trade war" of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our business may be impacted by international instability , war, terrorism, and geopolitical events.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	International political and economic instability or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or other business operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	A slowdown in economic growth in some emerging markets could result in long sales cycles, greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets, could have an adverse effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers and manufacturing vendors.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P83_S3	All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Because of OEMs and distributors relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenue from these relationships.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S3	These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S4	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P86_S5	Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $16.0 million and $17.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ( DSO ) at the end of Fiscal 2018 was 69 days, compared with 68 days at the end of Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We may experience a delay in payment or may not collect on the Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement or Promissory Note with Turbine International, LLC.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the Assignment Agreement ) and Promissory Note (the Note ) with TI.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC upon TI s payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	As of March 31, 2018, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the Guarantor ), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI s obligations under the Agreement and Note.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the Amended Assignment Agreement ) and the Note (the Amended Note ) with TI.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI s payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	E-Finity accounted for approximately 16% of our revenue for Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Additionally, Serba, E-Finity and Supernova, accounted for 20%, 18% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The loss of E-Finity or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S2	We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S3	In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S4	Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S5	The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S6	For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S7	We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P103_S8	Non compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P104_S2	We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	on site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back up or standby purposes.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P107_S2	This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P107_S3	In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on site generation.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P110_S2	We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P110_S3	Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Potential intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	From time to time, we may face litigation relating to intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder and other matters.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Whether or not resolved in a manner adverse to us, any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Further, our insurance coverage is limited for these and other claims against us, and we may not have adequate insurance or financial resources to pay for our liabilities or losses from any such claims.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We view our intellectual property rights as important assets.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S2	These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S3	The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S4	If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S5	We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S6	Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S7	In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P114_S8	Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We face security and cybersecurity risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential business and product data.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P115_S1	If we are unable to protect our data or the data of our customers, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business .
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face security and cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Our business, including our turbines and related energy assets may be vulnerable to a data compromise, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins and manipulations and similar disruptions, which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems and assets, which include vulnerability scans and patching, network firewalls, identity and access management, data encryption, intrusion detection and prevention devices.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Regular penetration tests of our networks are conducted by a third party service provider and we leverage any findings to further enhance our security.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S2	We also employ secure file transfer options to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Our critical data is backed up to a separate secured data storage facility.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S4	However, our efforts may not be able to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks and a successful breach of our computer systems could result in misappropriation of personal, payment or sensitive business information.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S5	In addition, we rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S6	A security breach involving confidential and proprietary data or the fleet of turbines we have deployed across the globe for our customers could damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S7	The competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation and our stock price could be impacted.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S8	In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of a security breach and, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S9	Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data and our products, our customers data and our customers turbines from a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security and accordingly any security breach may have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S10	Moreover, changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which became effective May 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S11	Consequently, we may incur significant costs related to prevention and compliance with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P117_S12	A failure to comply with the stringent rules of the GDPR could result in fines of up to 20 million.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S3	A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P119_S5	If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	At March 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $657.8 million and $146.6 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P121_S1	These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	On December 22, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P124_S1	We continue to analyze the impact the Tax Act may have on our business including the impact of the total post-1986 foreign earnings and profits for our foreign subsidiary.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P124_S2	Notwithstanding the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P124_S3	In addition, guidance is still forthcoming, and no assurance can be made that future guidance will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	We may acquire other businesses in the future and the success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P126_S1	The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P126_S2	Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P126_S3	If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S1	We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S2	These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S3	Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S4	This could result in a lack of the experienced in house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P128_S5	Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P129_S0	We have effected reductions in our operating costs and, as a result, our ability to cut costs further and sustain our business initiatives may be limited.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Beginning in late 2008, we have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating costs across all functions of the Company and focus our business efforts on our most promising near-term product opportunities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P130_S1	As a result of these cost-cutting initiatives, we may have a more limited ability to further reduce costs to increase our liquidity should such measures become necessary.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P130_S2	Any further reductions may have a materially negative impact on our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P131_S0	We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P132_S0	If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P132_S1	Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P132_S2	We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P132_S3	We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P134_S1	The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P134_S2	Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P134_S3	There can be no assurance that we can do so.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Our internal control systems rely on employees trained in the execution of the controls.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P135_S1	Loss of these employees or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P137_S1	Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P137_S2	Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P137_S3	If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P138_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S1	This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S2	Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S3	We may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S4	If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P139_S5	Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P140_S0	We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We and certain of our current and former officers are named as defendants in a shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and in a separate but similar lawsuit brought by two individual shareholders in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S1	Additionally, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in various state and federal derivative suits.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S2	We may be named as defendants in future lawsuits.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S3	These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time, attention and resources.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S4	Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P141_S5	In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P142_S1	In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P142_S2	See Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P143_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S2	On December 12, 2016, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S3	On June 13, 2017 we were afforded an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S4	On October 26, 2017 we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S5	On December 18, 2017, we received a notice from the Nasdaq stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S6	In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was afforded 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S7	On April 2, 2018 we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P144_S8	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P145_S0	If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P145_S1	This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P146_S0	The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S0	An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S1	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S2	Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S3	This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S4	Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P147_S5	Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P148_S0	further decreases in or continued low levels of oil, natural gas and electricity prices.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P149_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P149_S1	The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P149_S2	These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P150_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P150_S1	This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P152_S0	A proxy contest and any related litigation would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by management, our board of directors and employees, and would divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P152_S1	Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P152_S2	We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors, management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P152_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above or the outcome of a proxy contest or any related litigation.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Similarly, a future proxy contest with any other activist investor could result in the turnover of a majority of our board of directors.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P153_S1	If such a change in the composition of our board of directors were to occur, it could trigger the change of control provisions of certain agreements and arrangements to which we are a party, including the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, our Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, between us and Darren Jamison, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, a change of control constitutes an event of default that would entitle Bridge Bank to, among other remedies, declare all of our outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements immediately due and payable.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, following a change of control, upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination of Mr. Jamison or certain of our other executive officers and employees, we will be obligated to make specified severance payments to the terminated employee.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P156_S0	If such a change in our board composition were to occur, and if our board of directors were unable to take certain mitigating action to avoid triggering, or if we were unable to obtain a waiver of, these and other similar change of control provisions to which we are subject, the resulting payments and other obligations required of us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our NOL rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P158_S1	These provisions include our board s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P159_S0	We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P160_S0	On May 6, 2016, we and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. successor-in-interest to Computershare Inc., as Rights Agent, entered into a Rights Agreement (the NOL Rights Agreement ) designed to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of us experiencing an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P160_S1	While this NOL Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our net operating losses, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from becoming 4.99% stockholders.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P160_S2	The NOL Rights Agreement could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P161_S0	The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P162_S1	Concerns over global stability and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have contributed to the extreme volatility of the markets which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Future issuances of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P164_S0	We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P164_S1	The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P164_S2	In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P165_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P166_S0	The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P166_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P166_S2	If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P166_S3	If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P167_S0	We do not intend to pay cash dividends.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P167_S1	We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P167_S2	Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P168_S0	We have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P168_S1	As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.
1009759_18_ITEM1A_P168_S2	Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we consolidated our operations and offices into our Van Nuys location in Southern California.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, R D and support facilities consist of approximately 79,000 square feet of leased office space, warehouse space and assembly, test space and manufacturing facility for our recuperator cores located at 16640 Stagg Street in Van Nuys, California.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	This lease will expire in February 2023 and we have one five year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Management believes our Van Nuys facility is adequate for our current needs.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease an approximately 98,000 square foot facility located at 21211 Nordhoff Street in Chatsworth, California.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	This lease expires in September 2019, and we have one five year option to extend the term of this lease.
1009759_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	We are in the process of identifying a candidate to sublet all or a portion of our facility in Chatsworth.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	Two putative securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the following captions: David Kinney, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-08914 on November 16, 2015 (the Kinney Complaint ) and Kevin M. Grooms, etc. v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:15-CV-09155 on December 18, 2015 (the Grooms Complaint ).
1009759_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	The putative class in the Kinney Complaint is comprised of all purchasers of our securities between November 7, 2013 and November 5, 2015.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	statements regarding BPC and the likelihood that BPC would not be able to fulfill many legal and financial obligations to us.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Kinney Complaint also alleges that our financial statements were not appropriately adjusted in light of this situation and were not maintained in accordance with GAAP, and that we lacked adequate internal controls over accounting.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Kinney Complaint alleges that these public statements and accounting irregularities constituted violations by all named defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by the individual defendants.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Grooms Complaint makes allegations and claims that are substantially identical to those in the Kinney Complaint, and both complaints seek compensatory damages of an undisclosed amount.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	On January 16, 2016, several shareholders filed motions to consolidate the Kinney and Grooms actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S5	On February 29, 2016, the Court granted the motions to consolidate, and appointed a lead plaintiff.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S6	On May 6, 2016, a Consolidated Amended Complaint with allegations and claims substantially identical to those of the Kinney Complaint was filed in the consolidated action.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S7	The putative class period in the Consolidated Amended Complaint is June 12, 2014 to November 5, 2015.

1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S11	Defendants motion to dismiss was filed June 2, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S12	Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss on July 7, 2017, and Defendants filed their reply in support of the motion to dismiss on July 28, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S13	The court vacated the hearing that was scheduled for August 18, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S14	On February 9, 2018, the Court issued an Order denying Defendants motion to dismiss.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S15	On March 30, 2018, Defendants filed an answer to the Consolidated Amended Complaint.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S16	On May 17, 2018, the Court issued a scheduling order setting a trial date of March 17, 2020.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S17	The parties are currently engaged in discovery.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P2_S18	We have not recorded any liability as of March 31, 2018 since any potential loss is not probable or reasonably estimable given the current status of the proceedings.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	An individual securities complaint was filed against us, our Chief Executive Officer, and additional unidentified defendants in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the following caption: FiveT Investment Management LTD, et al., v. Capstone Turbine, et al., No. 2:18-CV-03512 on April 25, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	The lawsuit alleges material misrepresentations and omissions regarding our revenue, sales, and operations because of alleged improper revenue recognition and backlog calculations related to BPC.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	The lawsuit alleges that these statements constituted violations by all named defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by the individual defendants.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S3	The complaint also asserts claims against all named defendants for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violations of California Civil Code sections 1709 and 1710, and California Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25401.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S4	Additionally, the complaint asserts a cause of action against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S5	It demands compensatory damages for the amount of damages allegedly suffered, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and fees.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S6	Defendants response to the complaint is currently due June 29, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P3_S7	We have not recorded any liability as of March 31, 2018 since any potential loss is not probable or reasonably estimable given the current status of the proceedings.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	On February 18, 2016, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in the State of California against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors under the following caption: Stesiak v. Jamison, et al., No. BC610782.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S1	The lawsuit alleges that certain of our current and former officers and directors knew or should have known that BPC would be unable to fulfill its obligations to us, but allowed us to make false and misleading statements regarding BPC and our financial condition.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S2	The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to timely adjust our account receivables and backlog to reflect BPC s inability to pay us.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S3	The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S4	It demands damages for the amount of damage sustained by us as a result of the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, that we institute corporate governance reforms, and disgorgement from the individual defendants.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P4_S5	On May 5, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking to stay this action until such time as the defendants motion(s) to dismiss the federal securities class action are either granted with prejudice or denied in whole or in part.

1009759_18_ITEM3_P10_S0	By letter dated July 7, 2017 (the Shareholder Demand ), Andre Rosowsky demanded that the Board of Directors take action to remedy purported breaches of fiduciary duties allegedly related to the claims asserted in the above-discussed securities class action and derivative actions.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P10_S1	On July 25, 2017, we acknowledged receipt of the Shareholder Demand and requested information from Mr. Rosowsky sufficient to show that he had standing to make the demand.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P10_S2	Our Board of Directors formed a committee to evaluate the Shareholder Demand in anticipation of receiving the requested information from Mr. Rosowsky.
1009759_18_ITEM3_P10_S3	Mr. Rosowsky has failed to respond to the request for information and therefore we believe that Mr. Rosowsky abandoned the Shareholder Demand.
1009759_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CPST .
1009759_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.
1009759_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	On December 12, 2016, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
1009759_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	On June 13, 2017 we were afforded an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
1009759_18_ITEM5_P0_S4	On October 26, 2017 we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.

1009759_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	There were no repurchases of shares of common stock made during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in this Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the market leader in microturbines based on the number of microturbines sold.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (combined heat and power ( CHP ) and combined cooling, heat and power ( CCHP )), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our microturbines can be interconnected to other distributed energy resources to form microgrids (also called distribution networks ) located within a specific geographic area and provide power to a group of buildings.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	During Fiscal 2018, we continued to execute on our three-pronged business profitability plan to reduce operating expenses; diversify and increase revenue; and improve gross margin.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	During Fiscal 2018 our net loss decreased by 60% to $10.0 million and our basic and diluted loss per share improved by 75% to $0.20 compared to $25.2 million and $0.79, respectively, in the same period of the previous year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Excluding compensation expense of approximately $0.9 million with respect to our one-time Leadership Incentive Program, our net loss during Fiscal 2018 was approximately $9.0 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted loss per share.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	The improvement in the net loss during Fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a reduction of operating expenses of approximately 9% from Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	The improvement in the net loss per share during Fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in weighted average shares outstanding to 51.3 million for Fiscal 2018 from 32.1 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our accessories, parts and service revenue increased 11% to a record high of $32.0 million or 39% of total revenue compared to $28.9 million or 37% of total revenue in Fiscal 2017 as global microturbine installations and factory protection plan revenue continued to expand.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	Our revenue from the United States and Canadian geographic markets during Fiscal 2018, improved to approximately 47% of revenue compared to 44% of revenue the same period last year primarily because the natural resources market continues to improve.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S7	Although we have experienced an improvement in revenue during Fiscal 2018 due to a rebound in oil prices, we continue to be impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets and the ongoing global geopolitical tensions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S8	We continued to rebuild our business in the Russian market by adding additional distributors in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) including the addition of our new distributor Turbine International, LLC ( TI ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P4_S9	Additionally, though the U.S. dollar has somewhat weakened against other currencies, it still continues to be an issue in select markets as the strong dollar makes our products more expensive in those markets as we sell in U.S. dollars.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our products continue to gain interest in all six of the major vertical markets (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, microgrid and transportation).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail and industrial applications globally.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The renewable energy market is fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and livestock manure.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our product sales in the oil and gas and other natural resources market is driven by our microturbines reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, our business strategy is to target projects within the energy efficiency and renewal energy markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	prices rebounded above $60.00 per barrel.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have also seen interest in critical power supply applications as customers want solutions that can handle both primary and backup power.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, management closely monitors operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	The key drivers to our success are revenue growth, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow and reduced cash usage.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives follows:
1009759_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, microgrid and transportation products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, we have refocused our business strategy to target projects within the energy efficiency and renewable energy markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following table summarizes our product shipments by vertical markets:
1009759_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy to provide a significant economic advantage to customers while reducing their onsite emissions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Compared with more traditional, independent generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including oil and gas exploration, production, and at compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of power.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated onsite.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally burned or released into the atmosphere.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts - flare gas, or associated gas, into a useable fuel to provide prime power to these sites.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies happening on a global scale.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural waste operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, and in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of system failure, momentary or otherwise, certain high demand power users, including high technology, health care and information systems facilities require higher levels of reliability in their power generation service.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize UPS to protect critical loads from power disturbances along with back-up diesel generators for extended outages.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	We offer an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	We have seen continued development in the critical market segment as it relates to heath care facilities.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that acts as a single controllable energy entity with respect to the grid.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Distributed energy resources typically include other dual-mode microturbines, reciprocating engines, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, fuel cells and battery storage.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Microgrids can be connected to larger electricity grids; however, in the event of a widespread outage, the microgrid will disconnect from the main grid and continue to operate independently to maintain the electricity supply to the homes and businesses that are connected to the microgrid s electricity network.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end-users by lowering their overall cost to operate and by providing a versatile dispatchable technology that is fuel flexible and scalable enough to fit a wide variety of applications.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have seen continued development in the microgrid market segment.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our technology is also used in HEV applications.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our customers have applied our products in HEV applications such as transit buses and Class 7 and 8 work trucks.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	In these applications, the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	The benefits of microturbine-powered HEV hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability when compared with traditional internal combustion engines.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our technology is also used in marine applications.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht market segments.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	The application for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary engine.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, thereby reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P23_S4	Another feasible application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Transportation is a developing market segment for us.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In Fiscal 2018, transportation products were only for customer demonstrations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net product orders were approximately $42.3 million and $43.8 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Ending backlog was approximately $97.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $113.0 at March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Book-to-bill ratio was 1.0:1 and 1.1:1 for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the Assignment Agreement ) and Promissory Note (the Note ) with Turbine International, LLC ( TI ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC Engineering, our former Russian distributor ( BPC ), upon TI s payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	As of March 31, 2018, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the Guarantor ), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI s obligations under the Agreement and Note.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the Amended Assignment Agreement ) and the Note (the Amended Note ) with TI.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI s payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Due to the above amendments, we removed from product backlog orders related to BPC for approximately $7.2 million.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	This removal was the result of product pricing that we no longer would honor.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	After removal of the foregoing orders, the remaining backlog related to BPC as of March 31, 2018 comprises up to approximately 42% of our total backlog.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	This remaining backlog related to BPC continues to be reviewed with TI and the other new distributors in the region, and they have the right to request delivery of those backlog orders if the associated projects proceed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	Nonetheless the remaining backlog related to BPC may be negatively impacted.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	Additionally, the timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Sales and Distribution Channels We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	A significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to distributors who resell our products to end users.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications that require longer lead time.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, single source suppliers with long lead times may be more challenging to transition to another supplier.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	We have an ongoing program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts wherever possible, however this has been challenging with low production volumes and increased pricing.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we received notification from one of our single source suppliers that they were at maximum capacity and would require prepayment and a significant increase in the price of multiple components in order to fulfill our supply requirements for Fiscal 2019.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	Due to their capacity issues, it is uncertain if we will experience an interruption in parts from this supplier or be able to fully offset or recover any resulting component price increases.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P48_S8	This could impact margins or sales in future quarters.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We believe that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage Capstone s promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Based on our recent progress and assuming achievement of targeted cost reductions and product mix, pricing and performance and our increasing accessories, parts and service revenue with improved gross margins, our financial model indicates that we will achieve positive cash flow when we generate $25 million in quarterly revenue with a 20% gross margin.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	We expect to have costs increase in certain areas in Fiscal 2019, including sales and marketing, which if not offset by an increase in revenue, would reduce margins and profitability as we have limited ability to further reduce costs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we consolidated our operations and offices into our Van Nuys location and we believe that our production capacity is approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	We believe we will be able to support this production capacity level by adding additional shifts, which would increase working capital requirements, and making some additional capital expenditures when necessary.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	obligations, stock based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	Other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	This evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows compared with the carrying value of the related assets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and the loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset group.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The estimated fair value of the assets is determined using the best information available.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Intangible assets include a manufacturing license, technology, backlog and customer relationships.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	We reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	We performed an analysis as of March 31, 2018 and determined that there was no impairment.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	See Note 5 Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first in first out ( FIFO ) basis) or net realizable value.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	We routinely evaluate the composition of our inventories and identify slow moving, excess, obsolete or otherwise impaired inventories.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Inventories identified as impaired are evaluated to determine if write downs are required.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	Included in this assessment is a review for obsolescence as a result of engineering changes in our product.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Future product enhancement and development may render certain inventories obsolete, resulting in additional write downs of inventories.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	In addition, inventories are classified as current or long term based on our sales forecast and also, in part, based on our projected usage for warranty claims and service.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	A change in forecast could impact the classification of inventories.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue from sales is recognized.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We also accrue the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer under warranty when, in our judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by us, it is prudent to provide such repairs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	We estimate warranty expenses based upon historical and projected product failure rates, estimated costs of parts, labor and shipping to repair or replace a unit and the number of units covered under the warranty period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	While we engage in extensive quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by failure rates and service costs in correcting failures.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	As we have more units commissioned and longer periods of actual performance, additional data becomes available to assess future warranty costs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	When we have sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S6	Changes in estimates are recorded in the period that new information, such as design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, becomes available.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P61_S7	Should actual failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty liability would be required and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our revenue consists of sales of products, parts, accessories and service, which includes FPPs, net of discounts.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our standard terms of sales to distributors and direct end users include transfer of title, care, custody and control at the point of shipment, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, no right of return or exchange, and no post shipment performance obligations by us except for warranties provided on the products and parts sold.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Service revenue derived from time and materials contracts is recognized as the service is performed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	FPP contracts are agreements to perform certain agreed upon service to maintain a product for a specified period of time.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Service revenue derived from FPP contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	We occasionally enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation, engineering and/or service.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	Effective January 1, 2018, we launched our DSS program to fund additional support for distributor business development activities, customer lead generation, brand awareness and tailored marketing services for each of our major geography and market vertical.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	Service revenue derived from DSS program began in March 2018 and is recognized on a pro rata basis as the distributors purchase our products.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and typically non interest bearing.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other accounts receivable allowances.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We evaluate all accounts aged over 60 days past payment terms.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if other conditions arise that result in an impairment of their ability or intention to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have a history of unprofitable operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	These losses generated significant federal and state net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	We record a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets associated with these NOLs if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns, a valuation allowance has been provided against all of our net deferred income tax assets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes, primarily foreign and state taxes.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	It is possible, however, that we could be profitable in the future at levels which could cause management to determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the NOL carryforwards.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Upon reaching such a conclusion, we would record the amount of net deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	Such adjustment would increase income in the period that the determination was made.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The use of Black Scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
1009759_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Expected volatility The estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon our actual historic stock prices over the expected option life, which represents our best estimate of expected volatility.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Expected option life The expected life, or term, of options granted was derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Risk free interest rate We used the yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The amount of stock based compensation cost is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and established an accounting policy election to assume zero forfeiture for awards and account for forfeitures when they occur.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue by geographic markets (amounts in millions):
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Revenue Revenue for Fiscal 2018 increased $5.6 million, or 7%, to $82.8 million from $77.2 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The change in revenue for Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 included increases in revenue of $5.5 million from the United States and Canadian markets, $3.8 million from the Asian and Australian markets, $2.4 million from the Middle East and African markets and $1.2 million from the Latin American market.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	These overall increases in revenue were offset by a decrease in revenue of $7.3 million from the European and Russian markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	The increase in revenue in the United States and Canadian markets during Fiscal 2018 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily because the natural resources and renewable energy vertical markets continues to improve.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	The increase in revenue in the Asian and Australian markets was primarily because we shipped more C1000 Signature Series systems into these markets during Fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S5	The increase in revenue in the Middle East and African markets during Fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in the previous year was primarily the result of our continued investment in key growth initiatives in those markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S6	Our revenue in the Middle East and African markets continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets and ongoing geopolitical tensions in these regions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S7	The increase in revenue in the Latin American market during Fiscal 2018 compared to the same period the previous year was primarily the result of higher accessories and parts shipments.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S8	During Fiscal 2018 we experienced softness in our microturbine product shipments in Latin America related to changes in the electrical interconnect and utility tariffs in Mexico and reduced capital and operational spending, particularly in the upstream and midstream sectors of the oil and gas markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P78_S9	The decrease in revenue in the European and Russian markets during Fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia and Ukraine and a strong U.S. dollar in certain markets making our products more expensive in such markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions):
1009759_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	For Fiscal 2018, revenue from microturbine products increased $2.5 million, or 5%, to $50.8 million from $48.3 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase in revenue was because of a favorable shift in product mix, as we sold a higher number of our C65 and C1000 Series systems during Fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Megawatts shipped was 49.3 megawatts during each of Fiscal 2018 and 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	Average revenue per megawatt shipped was approximately $1.0 million during each of Fiscal 2018 and 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	For Fiscal 2018, revenue from our accessories and parts increased $0.9 million, or 6%, to $15.9 million from $15.0 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase in revenue from accessories and parts was primarily because of higher accessories shipments of our Organic Rankine Cycle ( ORC ) systems and heat recovery modules offset by lower parts shipments during Fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	The decrease in parts shipments was primarily due to timing of certain parts sales promotions that occurred during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Service revenue for Fiscal 2018 increased $2.2 million, or 16%, to $16.1 million from $13.9 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The increase in service revenue was primarily the result of our growing installed base and an increase in our energy efficiency customers purchasing our FPP service agreements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Additionally, effective January 1, 2018 we launched our Distributor Support System ( DSS program ) to fund additional support for distributor business development activities, customer lead generation, brand awareness and tailored marketing services for each of our major geography and market vertical.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	Earned revenue for our DSS program have been recorded as revenue and included under the caption Service revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Sales to E-Finity Distributed Generation, LLC ( E-Finity), one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 16% and 14% of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Sales to Horizon Power Systems ( Horizon ), one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 11% of our revenue for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Gross Margin Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The gross margin was $15.0 million, or 18% of revenue, for Fiscal 2018 compared to a gross margin of $1.8 million, or 2% of revenue, for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	The increase in gross margin of $13.2 million, compared to Fiscal 2017 was primarily because of lower expenses associated with warranty costs of $6.1 million, a favorable shift in product mix of $4.8 million and lower production and service center labor and overhead expense of $2.4 million, offset by higher inventory charges of $0.1 million.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition to consolidating our manufacturing processes into our Van Nuys location, management continues to implement initiatives to improve gross margin in Fiscal 2019 by further reducing manufacturing overhead and fixed and direct material costs, and improving product performance as we work to achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Warranty expense is a combination of a standard warranty provision recorded at the time revenue is recognized and changes, if any, in estimates for reliability repair programs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Reliability repair programs are based upon estimates that are recorded in the period that new information becomes available, including design changes, cost of repair and product enhancements, which can include both in-warranty and out-of-warranty systems.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The decrease in warranty expense of $6.1 million during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 reflects decreases in reliability repair programs, warranty accommodations, warranty claims and the result of a benefit recognized in the same period last year related to the decrease in the number of units covered under warranty in the period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	During Fiscal 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash warranty provision of approximately $5.2 million to retrofit proactively select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance and reliability.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The remaining non-cash warranty provision of approximately $0.6 million for this reliability repair program was reversed during Fiscal 2018 because the program was completed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	Management expects warranty expense in Fiscal 2019 to be lower than in Fiscal 2018 primarily because of a decrease in reliability repair programs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Production and service center labor and overhead expense decreased $2.4 million during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 primarily because of decreases of $0.9 million in supplies expense, $0.5 million in facilities expense, $0.3 million in salaries expense and $0.2 million in consulting expense.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	These decreases were primarily the result of consolidating our manufacturing process into our Van Nuys location and our cost reduction program to lower labor and overhead expenses throughout the organization.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	In addition, overhead allocated to finished goods inventory increased $0.5 million.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Inventory charges increased $0.1 million during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 primarily as the result of a decrease in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following table summarizes our gross margin (in millions except percentages):
1009759_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Product gross margin increased to 6% during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 primarily because of a decrease in warranty expense, a shift in product mix and lower production and service center labor and overhead expense in the current period.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The decrease in warranty expense during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 reflects the reversal of the remaining non-cash warranty provision of approximately $0.6 million during Fiscal 2018 compared to a one-time non-cash warranty provision of approximately $5.2 million that was recorded during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Accessories, parts and service gross margin increased to 38% during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 primarily because of higher accessories shipments of our ORC systems and heat recovery modules, earned revenue for our DSS program, increase in energy efficiency customers purchasing our FPP service agreements and timing of FPP services performed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Research and Development Expenses ( R D ) R D expenses for Fiscal 2018 decreased $1.4 million, or 26%, to $4.0 million from $5.4 million in Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The overall decrease in R D expenses of approximately $1.4 million resulted from decreases in salaries expense of approximately $1.0 million, supplies expense of $0.2 million and facilities expense of $0.2 million, which was a result of the reduction in the number of active research projects, because of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses and achieve profitability.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	Management expects R D expenses in Fiscal 2019 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2018 as a result of ongoing product development costs.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses SG A expenses for Fiscal 2018 decreased $1.1 million, or 5%, to $19.6 million from $20.7 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The net decrease in SG A expenses was comprised of decreases of approximately $0.7 million in professional services expense, including accounting expense, legal expense and bank fees, $0.3 million in facility expense, $0.3 million in supplies expense and $0.2 million in marketing expense.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	These decreases were offset by lower bad debt recovery of $0.4 million compared to Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	During the three months ended March 31, 2018 we recorded approximately $0.9 million in compensation expense in SG A with respect to our one-time Leadership Incentive Program.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P93_S4	Excluding bad debt recovery, management expects SG A expenses in Fiscal 2019 to be slightly higher than in Fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increases in allocated costs for salaries expense, shared-services and professional services, including legal and shareholder expenses.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $0.1 million, or 20%, to $0.6 million during Fiscal 2018 from $0.5 million for Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	Interest expense increased primarily from higher average balances outstanding under our credit facility.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	As of March 31, 2018, we had total debt of $8.5 million outstanding under the credit facility.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Income Tax Provision Income tax expense decreased $1,000, or 5%, to $18,000 during Fiscal 2018 from $19,000 during Fiscal 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	Income tax expense incurred was related to state and foreign taxes.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	The effective income tax rate of -0.2% differs from the federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 30.8% primarily as a result of recording taxable losses.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	We provided a valuation allowance for 100% of our net deferred tax asset of $173.8 million at March 31, 2018 because the realization of the benefits of these favorable tax attributes in future income tax returns is not deemed more likely than not.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	Similarly, at March 31, 2017, the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) was enacted in December 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	As of March 31, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S4	However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S5	The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $87.7 million.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P98_S6	The provisional amount of $87.7 million was fully offset by a change in the valuation allowance.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	The Company changed its method of accounting for warrants through the early adoption of ASU 2017-11 during the three months ended June 30, 2017 on a full retrospective basis.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Because of the retrospective adoption, the Company credited change in fair value of warrant liability on its consolidated statements of operations by $1.8 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our plan.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	We expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to running our business and implementing the strategic changes summarized herein.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Our planned capital expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2019 include approximately $1.0 million for plant and equipment costs related to manufacturing and operations.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared to an increase of $3.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during Fiscal 2018 compared to the increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the same period last year was because of higher cash generated from financing activities primarily from the issuance of common stock warrants and underwritten public offering during Fiscal 2017 as described below.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Operating Activities During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we used $8.6 million in cash in our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of $10.0 million and cash used for working capital of $2.8 million, offset by non cash adjustments (primarily warranty provision, accounts receivable allowances, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and inventory provision) of $4.2 million.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	The change in non-cash operating activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period the previous fiscal year was primarily because of the provision for warranty expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to retrofit proactively select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	The change in accounts receivable was the result of higher revenue and higher collection of accounts receivable during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	The change in inventory was primarily the result of an increase in finished goods during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period the previous fiscal year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily the result of the level of inventory receipts and timing of payments made by us during the fiscal year ended March 31 2018 compared to the same period the previous fiscal year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P110_S4	The change in other operating assets and liabilities was primarily because of a reduction in warranty payments for the proactive retrofit of certain non-Signature Series C200 microturbines during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	The funds generated from financing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were primarily the result of proceeds from the at-the-market offering program and the October 2017 exercise of warrants described below, offset by net repayments under the credit facility and the repayment of notes payable and capital lease obligations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	The funds generated from financing activities during Fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of proceeds from the October 2016 offering of common stock and warrants and the April 2016 underwritten public offering described below, offset by net repayments under the credit facility and the repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations.

1009759_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	The Domestic Facility also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	An event of default for this or any other reason, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P128_S3	As of March 31, 2018 we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements for Fiscal 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	Working Capital Cash used in working capital was $2.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, an decrease of $0.6 million from the $3.4 million cash used during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	We attribute the decrease in our working capital requirements primarily because of lower accounts receivable and warranty payments offset by higher finished goods inventory and an increase in accounts payable payments.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	The increase in finished goods was primarily because we didn t fully achieve our planned number of product shipments during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	Evaluation of Ability to Maintain Current Level of Operations In connection with preparing the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they became due for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2018 financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	Management assessed that there were such conditions and events, including a history of recurring operating losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, the continued negative impact by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar in certain markets making our products more expensive in such markets and ongoing global geopolitical tensions.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	Our working capital requirements during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were in-line with management s expectations, which included higher collection of accounts receivable and the continued management of the timing of payments of accounts payable.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S3	However, we didn t fully achieve our planned number of product shipments during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, resulting in an increase in finished goods inventory.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S4	The Company incurred a net loss of $10.0 million and used cash in operating activities of $8.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P130_S5	The Company also had capital expenditures related to the consolidation of its facilities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, which contributed to the cash used in investing activities.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.4 million, and outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $8.5 million.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Management evaluated these conditions in relation to our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	Our ability to continue current operations and to execute on management s plan is dependent on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	Management believes that we will continue to make progress on our path to profitability by continuing to lower our operating costs and to develop our geographical and vertical markets.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	funds by selling additional securities (through the at-the-market offering or otherwise) to the public or to selected investors or by obtaining additional debt financing.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms or at all.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P133_S3	In addition, any equity or debt securities that we would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Based on our current operating plan, management anticipates that, given current working capital levels, current financial projections, the ability to borrow under our credit facility and the funds raised by selling additional securities through the at-the-market offering as of the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2018 financial statements, we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of its Fiscal 2018 financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	Depending on the timing of our future sales and collection of related receivables, managing inventory costs and the timing of inventory purchases and deliveries required to fulfill the backlog, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume which is dependent on many factors, including:
1009759_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	our customers ability to afford and/or finance our products.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $16.0 million and $17.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, ( DSO ), increased by one day to 69 days as of March 31, 2018 compared to 68 days as of March 31, 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P137_S2	We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P138_S2	In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P138_S3	Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the previously referenced economic and geopolitical considerations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	We do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	In an effort to offset the adverse impact of inflation on earnings, we have historically raised selling prices on all products, parts, accessories and services.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P141_S1	However, any future adverse impact of inflation on our raw materials and energy costs may not be similarly recoverable through our selling price increases.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	No 2018-02, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2018-02").
1009759_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	The ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Act in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P142_S2	The Company adopted this ASU, which resulted in no adjustment to retained earnings.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118 ) directing taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as provisional when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	In accordance with SAB 118, our estimated income tax is considered provisional and our analysis is expected to be finalized by the end of the 2018 calendar year.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	In July 2017, the FASB issued a two-part ASU No. 2017-11, I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments With Down Round Features and II.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests With a Scope Exception ( ASU 2017-11 ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P144_S2	ASU 2017-11 amends guidance in FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	The amendments in Part I of ASU 2017-11 change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	The amendments in Part II of ASU 2017-11 re-characterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	Those amendments do not have an accounting effect.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	ASU 2017-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	We adopted ASU 2017-11 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and retrospectively applied ASU 2017-11 as required.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P146_S2	See Note 10 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on changes as a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-11.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02 ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P147_S3	New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P147_S4	In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842), which provides additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1009759_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes a majority of existing revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP, and requires companies to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	Companies may need to apply more judgment and estimation techniques or methods while recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures to the financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P151_S3	In addition, in March 2016, April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ( ASU 2016-08 ), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ), ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12 ) and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2016-20 ), respectively, to amend certain guidance in ASU 2014-09.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09 and all amendments to it, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	We plan to adopt ASU 2014-09, as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the FASB related to this new revenue standard, on April 1, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	We have developed our plan for implementing the new standard, which includes, but is not limited to, identifying contract populations and in scope customer contracts, identifying performance obligations in those customer contracts, and evaluating any impact of variable consideration.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P153_S2	We have evaluated the transition methods and will likely apply the modified retrospective transition method, which would result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect, if any, of applying the standard to contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P153_S3	Under this method, we would not restate the prior financial statements presented, therefore the new standard requires us to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes, if any.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	The impact that the new revenue recognition standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures has not yet been fully assessed.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	However, we do not expect the provisions of the new standard to have a material effect on the timing or amount of revenue we recognize.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P154_S2	Our assessment also includes determining the impact the new standard may have on the revenue reporting processes, including disclosures, ensuring internal controls will operate effectively with the new standard and performing gap analyses on collected data and determining the relative accounting positions where applicable.
1009759_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Included in our assessment of the new standard, is the potential impact on sales commissions and the term over which they will amortize.
1009759_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item.
1009759_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule included in this Form 10 K beginning at page F 1 are incorporated in this Item 8 by reference.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Exchange Act).
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms prescribed by the SEC.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Additionally, such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018.
1009759_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
